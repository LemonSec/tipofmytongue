1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:05,839
are so I there is by her

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,110
ground control ground control to Major
Tom

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,329
alright arm what we say about IRC

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,070
is obviously saw a few people out there
that are obvious occasionally using a

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,630
hall

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,960
yeah but no

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,109
some people have some awesome experience
with IRC

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:32,829
I am they were here is I heard road to
tell you all about it

9
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:37,399
II when

10
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,530
well while Thanks for call come when I
don't think many people come for this 10

11
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,110
so

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,360
right when I thought to the title and
now this overall the history the

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,480
using this little IRC network I thought
you knows

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,510
with the semi good story and all a good
friends here and people used it for many

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,949
years longer than I have

16
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,320
um you know I've been around almost 10
years and I'm

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,500
you know it's just by chance by that I
got involved with it

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,960
um you know when I was younger I was the
had a brush in with the police and

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,470
you know there's only one community that
I could understand well so angry at that

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,070
time

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,770
and and saw her like an hour I reads
2600 and so you know i got really into

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,729
it and started 26 on a meeting

23
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:22,150
and you know meant a lot to call people
and whatnot and then

24
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,680
you know throughout the years over Obama
took a little while but I met a lot of

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,189
his new york eyes and started coming to
this conference

26
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:32,320
you know but um a lot crazier things
have happened over last year's wilshire

27
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,329
kinda funny and at other times as a
whole lotta trolling him

28
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:41,130
bullshit but a lot of the people here
use it and also the controls and

29
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,140
you know I all their lead

30
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,570
everybody sometimes it is a little much
where we are friends at the

31
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,600
at the con the stuff is sometimes the
trolling is just kinda ridiculous

32
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,060
so that people can be like oh it's RC
the worry about it like no you're I

33
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,979
don't worry about it and don't complain
when you're banned because you trolled

34
00:01:58,979 --> 00:01:59,920
for three weeks

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,040
you know what's up like okay we get a
dude your dick

36
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,890
pledge but I mean so it's just a simple
there are seen at work but we put enough

37
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,129
into it to keep it up

38
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:15,429
through all the crazy stuff like you
know the whole section going up in

39
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,050
all that these officers before that
though take out like the Triple H years

40
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:19,650
ago

41
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,300
I mean facilities overflying order

42
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,620
her well the house but does before me I
mean look more than ten years ago our

43
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,260
jackie mao took a baseball bat or the
servers you know that's with us but

44
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,780
servers 3/3 does before me in so when I
got with that it was

45
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,489
you know is just a few verses like
Chardy back in the day and and from the

46
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,980
Triple H other people and eventually I
met this guy to tell a freakin

47
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,940
and so be started help me hosted other
people and um

48
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,440
would ever take a whole lot love
direction from manual but we still try

49
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,720
to keep it 2600 for this community

50
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,750
and now with his little the

51
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,560
poke and prod as possible it's just a
little RC network so

52
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,080
I'll try to run it is stable and and
transparent as possible simple software

53
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,810
and but we can all have a lot of stories
about what happened over the last 10

54
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,159
years

55
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,260
so that's the basic overview and did
want to introduce some other people have

56
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,810
used it and I am

57
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,250
and you know the plan this guy we did
talk in Germany this is kind of an

58
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,620
extension of that but

59
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,290
this is more about 2600 and what this
network experience versus just hosting

60
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,489
any online community

61
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,599
so just with a tire see this is a this a
little bit that sell

62
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,739
what can you say viewing um

63
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:37,030
the baseball bat ideas sometimes sounds
very very nice

64
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,190
I'll have to go into a cow arm

65
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,340
you know just like with any community
you there can be

66
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,670
what's the infighting and supply gap but
the one thing I always take from it is

67
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,069
it's fucking RZ

68
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:52,400
you know its all it is so whenever is to
add a PM

69
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,760
I'm usually somehow you a little bit
better than a Ronin is to be like Walker

70
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,720
in this Go

71
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,870
fuck it in Supplier the here her

72
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,810
up I don't think it really is as
personally by arm

73
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,720
the denial of service attacks become
more yeah and you can I feel so much Al

74
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,700
Ain latest I spent a lot more money

75
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,849
protecting it and you know other
different different host and whatnot so

76
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:19,090
you know it's just a simple RC that
works or not gonna dump a bunch enters a

77
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,190
people dos on it and crap on it and

78
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,340
you know we keep us a stable and secure
but that's one thing I

79
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,919
struggle with the some people expect us
to protector anonymity and it's like a

80
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,169
logo anonymously

81
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,810
okay do go for a bit like they're like
you're not home yeah I'm asking our host

82
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,600
Maskin

83
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,729
you to protect your identity it's like
now we'll make any claims to any that

84
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,479
you know it's like that's the
responsibility we keep their scene at

85
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:42,359
work stables

86
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,410
and secure as possible but 'em is be an
anonymous

87
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:53,410
you know you can jerseys only Torin you
know but none of my life systems that

88
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,950
was before me

89
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,409
saw in the last ten years since I've
been doing it we have never had any big

90
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,430
a.m. hot problems just la de da schism

91
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,820
you know crazy stuff than one thing it's
been interesting is is you know I'm not

92
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,510
one

93
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,060
you know manual said that it should be
taken care by the community's

94
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,190
so I'm not one to run to the cobs by the
feds or whatever you know when someone

95
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,219
toss us like

96
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,530
like I said in German it's like i don't
care what they do on the internet just

97
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,210
leave it alone

98
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,060
leave us alone like you know so
ridiculous so what I did started doing

99
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,760
is when people de dos es

100
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,010
um filter out that information we don't
do any log in but when they do da says

101
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,599
we get all the pick-up side is publisher
out to everyone

102
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:35,560
circle it does any body that researchers
have people who want to screw with the

103
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,930
like sure go ahead is a botnet and saw a
lot of times they

104
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,500
they've the say it's no big deal but
then later on

105
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,440
a then a blues and a lot other botnet
and have to cast are over again because

106
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,400
other people in the community to carry
it

107
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,840
said ok a so it's interest in all the
people that you mean all the craziness

108
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,539
but there is some redeeming factors
within so

109
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:59,760
plotters redeeming factors this summer's
people in the front row here or troll

110
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,880
constantly in

111
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,960
in slum indians lines

112
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,109
nyquil okay and in the winter the
beginning i mean the beginning was

113
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,400
I am you know after I had a little brush
with the law you know I started with the

114
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,229
26 had a median San then some started
using the crappy network has existed

115
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:22,640
and it was crazy they could barely keep
it up it

116
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,159
of these problems with the and so I
started hosting it was Chardy

117
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:29,360
a thromboxane that became part of the
policy the

118
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,919
I was like I run a dataset I can give ya
kinda hosting way more than Hosur of

119
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,049
your DSL line

120
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,630
and 'em ended up getting involved that
we were short it was like we have to be

121
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,310
involved

122
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,289
you can just gimme an empty box and and
let me do it

123
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:47,180
you do it so that I start I got involved
this damn thing

124
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,370
and the so yeah

125
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,599
Los acting was interesting when they
showed up there like fans of ours but

126
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,510
that also they ended up just toss on us

127
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,330
so that's why i like and and there's no
arguments or anything they're just like

128
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,469
we're leaving them and then

129
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:08,469
the 185 K wars way before that was just
some crap kid who had a friend's botnet

130
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,479
and for no reason just wandered off the
hell are this other people %ah sir

131
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:14,620
connections so

132
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,930
now a host on data centers and its
isolated from all over personal stuff in

133
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,919
just RC networks of you hit you just
gotta exposure botnet

134
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,740
and and the trolls we deal with it as
much as we can and

135
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,840
some just try to keep in the spirit
which what little

136
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,099
Emanuel said as far as running he kinda
just lets us run in the community runs

137
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:34,570
in

138
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,630
and I try to respect the brand you know
as far as you're caught that 2600 but

139
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,070
thats

140
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,310
thats they are seen our so it's small
but

141
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,339
AZL very much a core group of different
people

142
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,430
which have come about all throughout the
all the ten years

143
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,719
cell last man standing as far as hosting
it after all the

144
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:55,820
crop is from me me and be

145
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,330
and then we got a couple British guys
but they're usually drink a lot so it's

146
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,709
hard to get around said a

147
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:04,200
but we know I mean they're on a secure
server so I his

148
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,669
but we're also on the cast BP and we try
to connect with other different

149
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:08,659
communities

150
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:12,570
and that's one thing about security and
anonymity there's other services that we

151
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,250
can work with them

152
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,839
can do that make it but better and
here's a guy in chaos bpm

153
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:23,990
we are still Inc all the Hackintosh well
that was when

154
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,479
unless I am yet but I'll add drama hope
their

155
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,339
yet so I his

156
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:34,659
policy say sis is one other trolls that
we get you know

157
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:38,458
overfly throughout the years he would
prefer to run it like we're everyone is

158
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,419
often a big kid is constant

159
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:46,120
more of its I so if he's always made
this argument forever an hour so I mean

160
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,000
whenever he

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,970
you know what's the run the network s
lecture you can China true that your own

162
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,510
channel

163
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,560
the word for 2600 necessarily

164
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,560
I up

165
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,250
so a 1 I'll score seven the the big pack
n split was

166
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,120
a.m. something we're couple channel
operator or not Chan offers web hosting

167
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,380
operators and

168
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,600
people have been involved with the for a
long time to scan to change their mind

169
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,380
one day

170
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,839
and didn't wanna have hackett linked
with that and so

171
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,029
the only I could keep them not stop
around 2600 and having a conflict there

172
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:25,769
as I had to split the network

173
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:30,190
so you know it's it's a II tellers it's
a special

174
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,209
community that requires special care

175
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:37,300
comments I cell

176
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,860
we still friends with Kaka and the cat
we could connect via the casket the end

177
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,720
but

178
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,120
well as that the special

179
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,810
it is a special needs is particularly in
I see it's definitely special needs

180
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,080
community i mean

181
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,680
and I'd try to put his little management
to as possible but

182
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,010
I just like this out with rival my
friends and writer

183
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,250
had to really adjust the signal to noise
ratio

184
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,290
in the public channels so a.m.

185
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,890
so what was your experience right
through the you know some your worst

186
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,350
times

187
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,500
well I mean it's mostly the that our
server stuff arm when I always find

188
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,740
interesting is

189
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,790
so for instance loading now serves
attack so we get

190
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,000
they usually I will spook addresses in
10 but every now and then you have a

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,320
special case where CID

192
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,510
doesn't know how to use the tool is
using to do that I'll service

193
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,740
so he gives up all the IP addresses
above his little botnet or whatever

194
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,930
but I really found interesting was
dealing with the companies are calling

195
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,700
them Mike

196
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,860
calling two different organizations you
gonna defer responses you get out of

197
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,330
them

198
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,050
because because whenever I call them I'd
try to act like this is a

199
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,240
mission-critical

200
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,660
I this network can not go down

201
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,800
which is complete bullshit but anyway
that's not the way but it so whatever

202
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,810
get on the phone with them or what not

203
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,000
II portray it as that and then arm

204
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,080
are some response is a really quick and
they're really good people and they say

205
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,250
who crap really that's happening walk
somebody in our network is attacking

206
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:00,910
your

207
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,199
you know machines or whatever I'll jump
on this router in at a co-worker

208
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,160
assaulting care

209
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,850
other ones you deal with are are

210
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,750
just give you things like are you sure
your computer doesn't have a virus on it

211
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,870
yeah it's called IRC it's the whole
fucking big tits and

212
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,029
the mess bomb a cell if

213
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:23,000
the so you get a different range other
responses from our

214
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,519
are different organizations I love them
tell you that you need to wait for 24

215
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,180
hours

216
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,589
before they'll mitigate the attack which
always which is great

217
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,600
is like out that so you can attack me
for 24 hours

218
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,140
and i cant really do very much about it
and then other providers for instance

219
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,910
some

220
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,980
are even though providers that we've met
so we get links from some a really good

221
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,209
summer really bad

222
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:47,579
we're dealing with and I'll service
attacks so it's always interesting

223
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:52,060
trying to the at even educate them on
what the hell is happening

224
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,680
and then the you know educating them on
what you're doing with the server in

225
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,000
general is forget it

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,510
arm by just so you know to the your

227
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,660
mayor is permitted that's the hard stuff
i mean well I dealt with a lot as well I

228
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,150
i

229
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,880
you the politics i neva in the when
people will fight cancer

230
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,210
you notice II don't usually get involved
in that

231
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:17,290
yeah I don't care well that marred the
policy I mean to operators and and

232
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,160
network operators a conduct

233
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,140
keep a separate a sensor is that many
people who are

234
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,890
really involve like protecting the 2600
channels and whatnot

235
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,460
I end up having to do a lot you know yes
to just co-host unit where you

236
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,880
you know respond to email a couple weeks
ago like the tossed no

237
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,080
a right now adds farm

238
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,120
it whenever silly little arguments going
to come

239
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,360
I'm so I mean I'm sure to the people
they're not very silly law

240
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,490
but they are are born 20 comply right
breath

241
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,570
but some um I don't like to get involved
in that what I wanna see is the Navy

242
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,480
network work

243
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,780
and be as stable as we can make it in
just function that's about as far as I

244
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,230
I go with it icon what people do in
channels and what not what they talk

245
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,960
about an hour

246
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,580
I don't really care mean at their deal
well that's what we try to do as far as

247
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,130
some a sign and send people to run
different channels

248
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,160
new people come on the network you know
sometimes I just come and go but when

249
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,110
they come

250
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,750
I've tried to just keep people you know
involved in if they were in the local

251
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,030
geographical location will let them run
that channel

252
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,680
from but there's a lot of people don't
know how to use the RC saw the support

253
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,480
requirements others like man

254
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,110
the IEEE I just let 'em like no you
figured out there like

255
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,290
protect minority right right right I

256
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,189
a lot of messages like that yeah so they
decide to ignore but also the all the

257
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,870
trip

258
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,840
well that's the things that people use
tore all the time

259
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,070
to fly into troll and whatnot but we we
try to allow tore

260
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,340
a but to make it really hard to tell you
i mean the two-hour

261
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,410
yeah the flooding cute or see going to
in banning all the different nodes

262
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,209
they can keep people but then you know
it's not like you don't necessarily

263
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:04,080
don't want toward a meal to be used but
just the nature of people using it to

264
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,930
screw with other people the rule is you
know only ban the abused ones

265
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,910
so it takes a while to get through all
the used ones home

266
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,459
there's a lot or no doubt there but
there's been lots a discussion about

267
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,370
the banning tore and after that does it
and its word

268
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,370
you know we try to not have to do that
but it's almost

269
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,600
a it's a gig it's a kind of a catch-22
if you don't do it then people use it to

270
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,160
you

271
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,480
screw with no channels and people can
communicate is efficiently

272
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,970
burden if you do you know if you do
block it then you're

273
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,240
taking away a piece that they can use
for the anonymity part

274
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,580
those kind of like this big pain in the
ass basically to yeah

275
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,220
so some

276
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,899
what else to say about the middle
history i mean we're still hosting a ten

277
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:47,500
years

278
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,839
what I want to do and start introducing
is some

279
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,120
trying to get some other local a hacker

280
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,490
some spaces to link to it and open it
more than

281
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,329
then it is others only a few people the
host in Rana we've been doing it a long

282
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:04,660
time and everyone so I'll ask for a
little direction from annular

283
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,759
local people and what not but a.m. you
know the house to be more involvement

284
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,430
it's still there stable

285
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,350
a but I'm not gonna keep door for every
man it's Justin Garcia like

286
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,870
my head but I've Nelson known that a
fifth if it wasn't for us for a long

287
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,629
time I just wanna be there

288
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:24,240
you know last time I went down like in
2003 permanently in

289
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,740
her right before that and it was
resurrected by us and Sade and when it

290
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,670
all started but

291
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,920
some if we just let it go I will just
totally go away

292
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:39,060
well that's one thing to israel and it
was totally on

293
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,560
your well I guess that's a good
community

294
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,050
the bonus for Oscars with has ever been
rooted in 10 years again

295
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,389
and no one's Mahara yeah

296
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:55,689
well that was before me when we switch
did

297
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:59,899
yeah um well with if you look at the
network now it's all the pirate network

298
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:03,930
know when Ted the databases in here and
offer the databases Chardy never

299
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,879
restarted the network from scratch

300
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,550
and became the pirate networking all the
servers are named after pirates and

301
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,290
no one's ever gone to the databases
sense so we keep the hubs in the

302
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,459
database is private

303
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:19,189
a.m. and that way those can be tossed we
can always bring up more servers

304
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:22,660
and today would like the PS is it's
really easy to just pop up

305
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,769
dps is another service all around the
world but I want to link

306
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:29,559
with more hacker spaces and more groups
that are trustworthy and doing good

307
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,620
stuff out there

308
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,629
unlike like my the title my life with
the thrill kill call there's a lot of

309
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,870
groups out there that aren't necessarily
to

310
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,720
copacetic to share information and so on
they're just like will sack or the

311
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,480
Jester

312
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,610
you know finances as a lotta drama lot
abortion

313
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,709
well %uh

314
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:52,500
hot so that's a that's actually pretty
good story about Tyler knows this I mean

315
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:52,920
he's

316
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,809
his chat with us a long time you know
Jeremy have and where I got over that

317
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:57,420
guy's

318
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,870
he is what he is and a but he never got
himself in trouble to 2600 at

319
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,030
sell his the trolls constantly and so

320
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,658
the the frack article you are talking
about the

321
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:13,730
so it's obvious that the roads you

322
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:19,449
under the pretty much yeah so yeah other
the frack articles a lil

323
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:22,709
I guess a little bit about me but most
of it was like his very

324
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,429
crazy interpretation oath

325
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:29,770
you know jus every day you know person
you know working

326
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,280
working in the real world Eunos I

327
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,970
I don't know I'm not going to make any
comments to be not a garbage bins let

328
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:38,360
you know

329
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,760
he was into like recycling everything
and there is a

330
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,539
yeah few

331
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:52,320
people like started the Trident blame it
on 2600 oh he chatted on 2600

332
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,379
all the time so he got busted Russell

333
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,640
we don't log the networks never been
serve with any process and we keep

334
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,110
isolated that way but a.m. when he got
busted people are saying that i win

335
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,350
took me a couple weeks I don't care a
whole lot but I read the complaint

336
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,719
and he had gotten busted on the private
IRC server

337
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,669
working with guys were all logging in is
using tor with no encryption

338
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:20,640
and they're just time the time zone you
can act in when he when it when you

339
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,740
would go out harvesting and come back
from

340
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,270
so I V I control little bit but better

341
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:32,510
a sold like people try to blame the IRC
network sometimes for stupid shit

342
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,539
and when they when it's their own fault
that's not the case I'm in Thailand know

343
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,140
this yet used to use it needs

344
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,750
you know that without had nothing to do
with us i mean a.m.

345
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,100
we don't log we never gone served some
you know

346
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:53,100
what can I say about I both yeah

347
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,010
no no idea hey I want more people
involved with it so I mean we can

348
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,410
I try to tell people and explain to
people how it hosted how we keep it away

349
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,020
in

350
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,100
harvard's cloud-hosted now and solve its
on and other infrastructure and a

351
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,690
dedicated data centers but

352
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,030
we keep it in such a fashion so it's not
gonna get routed

353
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,300
the mixer databases we watch that really
closely with all the hacks that are

354
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,060
going on

355
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm so try to keep the servers and the
networks in such a way that we

356
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,450
dolla boy the simple mystics does it is
the hour

357
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,870
know your only half a day

358
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,460
right right that's great day for me I

359
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,970
half a day then yeah i know i

360
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,070
that's how I started in when I was host
at Wishard I had data centers I had

361
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,020
T 1's all over the place and so is like
at the store up servers and then

362
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:52,720
this crack addict like rot 13 dk
whatever his name was fact

363
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,790
he would %ah says all the time for weeks
and like

364
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,440
it took out a lot of stuff we just kept
going kept it going in

365
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,720
a.m. so I'm not too sad I have it now
but I don't wanna like just let it die

366
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,220
languish cell

367
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,350
CCC people who like in use it and cast
EP and another hacker space is I think

368
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,690
that they can grow in

369
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,009
do a lot lot more enjoyment and said all
the trolls

370
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:20,070
you know I

371
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,120
so I mean there's always group's seem to
come and go and I'm not

372
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,360
I thought about like list them all over
all the years but

373
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,600
it doesn't really matter it's like you
guys know who you are I

374
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,240
a and sometimes they just you know
they're coming on their own

375
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,930
and by one guy became a troll
ridiculously like when

376
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,690
you know things changed my life like by
hacker dog he passed away it comes in

377
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,260
like since dead lol

378
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,750
okay dude they alright so fine so

379
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,270
a.m. but the the network its provided a
lot of friendship a lot of connections

380
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,540
with many people

381
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,659
and that's what it's kinda based off
regardless I'll

382
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,960
above all that BS but a.m. you know and
a lot of us are still friends even

383
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,940
though we control each other pretty damn
good

384
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,910
'em so but the it's been interesting
lately

385
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,040
you know I I thought with the little
over

386
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,730
loss not lead with his little

387
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,370
both input I've gone from an oversized
appointees DNS to us in like

388
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,450
the one news article about in 2003

389
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,780
hit a did

390
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,240
know it still is yeah a little bit in
the mag any mentions it on the radio

391
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,640
station when the German

392
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,820
the of the wall off the hook in so I
mean I pressure I thank him for giving

393
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,050
us the opportunity to host in

394
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:39,820
give me a voice for many years through
many different chapters in my life and

395
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,500
I'm

396
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,840
so I mean it's I i'm glad to be a part
of its kinda cool

397
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,480
and I've managed I learned a lot about
hosting ridiculous stuff like you set up

398
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,990
an ally to providers and

399
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,380
his girl I not even lives like no it's
not are botnet

400
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,470
leg directly idiot like what did you
reboot your server

401
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,650
I sorry

402
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,920
deal with a lot of BS I just we try to
keep it to the minimum but a.m.

403
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,820
you know has it sits pros and cons I
think it outweighs itself so

404
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,120
Europe these jackasses here

405
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,810
yeah I either yeah it's well it's very
minimally modified only two so that

406
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,780
allows a.m.

407
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,230
as a selling channel only so what let
him and

408
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:27,290
yep here so are we

409
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:32,110
we can always do SSL you know done minor
modifications to the hybrid our city and

410
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,990
I'm

411
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:37,560
and that's a keeper sample maintainable
you know so theoretically any decent

412
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,980
Linux admin kid

413
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,860
keep it maintained in school

414
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,880
%uh yes on scuttled ot Matt

415
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,190
I am you can look at all the
specifications

416
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,220
love love the software you can download
and install yourself

417
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:58,100
and a.m. its it's all this that up there
so I mean we tricky part is transparent

418
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,640
and simple as possible

419
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,640
well now he's never link in his just as
much control as you guys I

420
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,780
now seriously I I swear to God I love
this guy but

421
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,860
I

422
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,930
up big because the overfly

423
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,680
yeah with

424
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,250
so one thing I've establishes that you
know sit my dog sitters with me

425
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,140
throughout all this and he'd learned how
to

426
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,450
r-ca been so there's a bot for the said
vicious and

427
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,160
even when people try to take over some
other channels he can just

428
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,830
instantly fix it all it's all with an OP
bassir but represented as the dog

429
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,590
they're still so he'll always watch you
bastard cell

430
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:50,199
a be yeah

431
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,950
mass ops for everyone that people's
revolution in the novelist's the

432
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:59,340
better cell but there's always like
stupid shit people say like I'm a fat or

433
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,600
something it's like you know

434
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,680
her work about kinda different them

435
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,020
well actually I think it's because the
majority the people can be such

436
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,670
dickheads talking to each other

437
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:13,380
there's like a 170 other people in the
channel who are afraid to say anything

438
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,530
site a trend

439
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,590
and sometimes though p.m. in their like
what's going on in like this

440
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:24,459
but just another day do I'm going back
to work just don't worry about it

441
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,520
but these dudes dude is whatever window
close window

442
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,510
the third I

443
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,970
well that's actually a great story that
started when

444
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,380
a mouse get involved with with these new
york eyes and a.m.

445
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,210
there is always a struggle balance in
channel moderation with lights

446
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,440
censorship and

447
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,200
I'm at times there is a some some people
who are the champion the bands have

448
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,490
certain words

449
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,490
and 'em it it was just saying

450
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,530
of course when you try to ban it
everyone's gonna your everybody music

451
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:03,200
so this created like this monstrous play
more on the mailing list then

452
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,150
in the channels in eventually some very
smart people decided to do a little

453
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:11,450
sigh ops and got the were changed to
CCNA

454
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:16,090
cell instead of like the N word woohoo
just his CCNA Andrew

455
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,929
everyone kinda thought for a long while
that was just the the talked about Cisco

456
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:20,650
certs

457
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,160
setup her just as dirty

458
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,550
just as bad cell

459
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,919
in close out on network class well

460
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,050
the change from the N word was the CCNA
and that lasted for a long time and the

461
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,800
people actually championed

462
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,570
these censorship us edward the

463
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,770
learn very much later in is thankful

464
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:48,000
that CCNA thing was pretty good yeah

465
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,870
deprive thought he won the battle and
was like yeah finally know what to say

466
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:55,900
the N word on 26 honored

467
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,720
I'll colours our your cell

468
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,430
said it once so yeah CCNA I mean this
wasted

469
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:09,130
mmm made a gator deal with the drama and
the channel

470
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,360
the moderation but we try to do it as
minimal as possible until it sis

471
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,130
ridiculous cell it'll whose with other
people yeah interferes with other people

472
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,930
like when they're just there was our
channel and eventually I just told The

473
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,720

476
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:30,830

477
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,639
I really am. I let him stay for so long
and he's

478
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,020
like DM me in like 2 don't to
intermediate I think

479
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,610
but I shop other artwork never by jester
he

480
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,520
eventually had to ask them to leave when
his users were like

481
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,520
there so they're OPSEC in the way that
they're on they're trolling and

482
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,420
everything is so bad they're all lying
to each other

483
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,100
and they're all placed each other blogs
and the rumor was that we locked the

484
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,940
network

485
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,510
and with all the chatter that comes
outta the jester and all those

486
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:04,260
bastards on Twitter Rowling on it was
just too much drama so at that point I

487
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,550
like I just heard

488
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,870

490
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:14,930
bring the drama here

491
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:19,890
and he understood in I but a sometimes
you gotta do that we try to keep it as

492
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,450
open as possible in it

493
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:25,420
negatively impact impacts the whole
network on all the people the different

494
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,730
channels then

495
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:31,360
then you're fucking hot ski soho a and
people like to come in from like our

496
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,540

00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:01,919
on things there for other projects and
you know it's like the my life for the

504
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,580

507
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,440
other

508

shoppers are coming on its crazy

514
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,320

get more involved well I think so and I

515
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,669

simple things that is

526
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,470

531
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,610
communicate with them so

532
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,990

the third

542
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,730
cell we try to keep it as open as
possible work with close friends and

604
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,110
I want other people to get involved and
because it is a lot of drama but it is a

605
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,160
lot of fun

606
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,290

607
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:21,460
cell both

608
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,570
other line I like these is so

609
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:28,550
back to the locker on this all kinds of
people who are security professionals

610
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,800
and then they still don't know what that
is

611
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,520
I another name any names but you know

612
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,600
and then a dude issues as a result is
what will you do it for

613
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,839
but endings as via some up

614
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,860
so I wish some people hang around just
to hang around with 26 that are not

615
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,030
necessarily hackers and that's pretty
cool

616
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,250
there's nothing wrong with that just
that's how I started like twenty years

617
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,219
ago I read the magazine annexes myself a
hacker

618

but you know it still caused a lot of

623
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,850
fun

624
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:19,220

ancillary to

638
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,580
2600 like a host here private shell
server third

you know just where just for cool people
to use in like

640
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,580

really know and trust on brain

644
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,790
and you know so one day this was sick
over the world or something but there is

645
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,050
lab rats L

646
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:40,570
um its is a lotta drama can happen just
by hosting this r/c network including

647
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:44,380
getting the services that had nothing to
do with the RC networker

648
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,740
you know I was like dude you need to
show I got nothin on you to show so bad

649
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,030
like I body in

650
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,610
you know I tell people on crypt your
home directory don't do anything stupid

651
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,370
to my box like

652
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:57,240
free comports can russia for 10 minutes
and find a box like don't do it for

653
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:57,790
myself

654
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:03,160
occur cell I and II I tried to fight
that the best I could and went to the FF

655
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,990
an ACLU and in a pain from legal
services but eventually

656
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,120
you know I was gonna go to jail for
someone else's agencies so

657
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,080
you have to you know comply with the
legal process eventually voters come

658
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,759
after use

659
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,100
so you know stupid shell server could
bring a whole lotta

660
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,370
be a so 'em

661
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:25,109
I there's a lot of crap about it and I'm

662
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:29,390
you know I had issue a press release for
some ridiculousness like you peep

663
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,910
like people knew about it even before I
did world was really

664
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:36,580
I wanna keep it up all the news of
WikiLeaks and anonymous all this

665
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,750
craziness is going on and then

666
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:43,600
you know I got this guy showing up like
itself and what sucks the most is that

667
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,480
I guess the feds were sold blind like
they did it go to the front web page

668
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,180
that said it was a shell server

669
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,410
so they thought it was me and sell
fortunately through just being in a in

670
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,930
for Guard member and and get free
training and just listening to what

671
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,899
the those guys are John a they knew who
I was and I called me

672
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,830
and they're like hey we should talk to
you and logo this is strange

673
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:10,450
and you know I was already ready I kinda
knew it I been through this before and

674
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,370
I'm

675
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,390
when they contact me out like well sorry
like

676
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,779
that that's three hundred people have
access to the server like

677
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,630
Yamana talk to you without an attorney
and you know I'm an ISP and

678
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,940
you know and so I had to comply but I
also did everything I could to protect

679
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,300
their privacy

680
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,590
and fight as much as I could with little
support so I mean I I give a lot to the

681
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,650
community but then sometimes like

682
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:35,920
you know when I after all these years I
love the F after they do a lot of cool

683
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,870
things but like I called him up I could
barely get like a tu email exchange

684
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,609
and they referred me to a five hundred
dollar turning the call me three days

685
00:38:42,609 --> 00:38:43,540
later

686
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,320
so I card for other people on the
committee it gave me helping game is the

687
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,640
support direction

688
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,660
and I was able to to to do what I could
but

689
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,940
you know when I look to that
organization I loved as I kinda shitty

690
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,090
and I'm not talking crap about them they
do a lot of wonderful things and I have

691
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:59,020
a purpose

692
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,410
but you know sometimes they could
probably do a little bit better as far

693
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,170
as

694
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:06,290
um giving a little more direction either
house members by

695
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,800
you're about to get raided what do you
do like you know the just the

696
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,920
I so I'm only venerated the frequently a

697
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,760
yeah I have been rated welcome to 2700

698
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,330
a this before the FBI's

699
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,779
so 'em Shia

700
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,510

good stuff is going on those

701
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:30,780

702
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,100
Road at around that time ago a little
bit after and obviously

703
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,200
little bit stressed hot about the whole
thing arm

704
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,270
likely ironically arm I

705
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:44,650
I was hoping him post pinky

706
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:48,340
but didn't they they didn't want that
particular

707
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,660
that was really strange I mean and it's
in my press release right tried to

708
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,879
explain that

709
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,770
they went after the old hardware not the
current one and it was with I didn't

they don't understand what's going on
I'm gonna either until like I realize

717
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,160

right lot of people have been wrapped up
in a lot of this BS and

724
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,819
a.m.

725
