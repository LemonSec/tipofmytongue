1
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:21,540
the

2
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,689
our brain our brain she takes

3
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,240
sort nixon's

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:38,240
pretty quick this work

5
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:40,559
taken with

6
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,230
me really the over projecting second
work I'll try to stand here then

7
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,840
I'll try really hard that's going to be
tough

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,000
I walk in are are

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,879
even if we have

10
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,320
completely random data sets shoved addis

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,760
our brains wanna make sense rate we want
it

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,929
organized customized turn into a symbol
some sort so that we can understand what

13
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,369
it is

14
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,509
I'll its first thing you see there

15
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:17,570
a face a cardboard box another image
file I

16
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,479
I think this is a good trait to have
great for little kids this is pretty

17
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,050
important

18
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,280
I think seeing a face if your baby you
can stream

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,460
daddy never processed before seeing the
face is pretty important

20
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:37,460
we've got a good shot that faces can
give you food baby with a mustache

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,789
this is %uh supposedly

22
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:49,330
path positively on this is a TI

23
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,140
aerial shot other farm field in Hungary
somewhere

24
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,130
on I looked it up side down for a little
bit and I felt like a donkey

25
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:04,560
there is that's me that's there's no at
the scene in that one

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,259
unexpected I should tell you I am i
names will Lindsay I I'm an educator

27
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,319
II media artist most my work

28
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,380
revolves around how we use technology
how

29
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,970
it change society and culture how our
culture and society changes technology

30
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,700
up beyond that I consider myself a
hacker

31
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,760
I use that version in the word meaning

32
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,720
I like to take things apart and put it
back together the wrong way and used for

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,700
something else

34
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,620
I do a little bit electronics s I do
some DIY

35
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,780
an open-source electronics online and

36
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,549
there may be a couple the out here but
I'm not I kinda avid shortwave radio

37
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:51,549
guy till a cup for the nine short wave
people I'm fairly interested in this

38
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:57,349
ideas what we called DX ng which means
listening for really weak signal that's

39
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:57,929
probably

40
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,299
too far away for the radio technology to
carry it very well

41
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:04,840
um I've always been interested in that
ever since I was a little kid

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,930
I accidentally hearing cuba

43
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,709
jumble in over my father's classic rock
station something on

44
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:16,019
one of the things that I got interested
in is kinda this

45
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,719
portability and when things that happens
in technology when we talk about the

46
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,879
history technology

47
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,899
is as the technologies I want to rate is
about to die

48
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,519
but some people feel that way as
technologies kinda get at the

49
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,359
and if they're curve acceptance wanna
things that happens to them as they get

50
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,099
really cheap

51
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:36,510
right cell if you think about the wrist
watch a man here

52
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,780
many people wear a wrist watch yeah this
is

53
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,930
hud how up lot a wrist watches in here

54
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,299
cell phone comes around everyone checks
what time is on their cell phone

55
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,989
people wearing less wristwatches what
happens to the wrist watch market

56
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,069
two things happened to it when people's
people start clicking

57
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,999
giving really expensive wristwatches and
sometimes old ones

58
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:03,409
and then you can get one in eight gumbo
machine for 50 cents rights you

59
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,590
the the manufacturing it's really cheap

60
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,579
markets over saturate this is going to
happen radio right now and I start

61
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:11,909
taking an interest in these

62
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:16,380
cheap radios this is a Radio Shack 2125

63
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,858
arm and its short wave in

64
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,770
I have one right here pouring water into
it sure to work later

65
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,479
I their small it's kind of amazing what
they've packed into this has lost and

66
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,600
feature I don't even have to turn the
knowledge

67
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,610
first but no for me try to find the next
station whenever I get a piece a crap

68
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,790
like this the first thing I like to do
with

69
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,270
is taken apart and so inevitably I'll
take it out the box

70
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,039
Alstare screws on the back for a little
bit after I turn on giving a test drive

71
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,680
no

72
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,480
and this is a particularly interesting
one when I googled it

73
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,740
it turned out there was a whole
community people who are ready hacking

74
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,360
the heck out

75
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,240
sticks they were doing something really
strange to it they were taking a scan

76
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,940
feature

77
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,290
you push a button it goes to the nearest
strong station

78
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,560
and US station to push again I'll go to
the next run station you listen to that

79
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,420
station

80
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,500
there's all these hacks published all
over the web for this and a whole bunch

81
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,070
different

82
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,099
Radio Shack radios that chill the
scanning system

83
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,800
it basically when it gets to a strong
station ignores it plays about it after

84
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,130
the second ovett minute discuss the next
one

85
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,940
and its Kansas Kansas cans for ever up

86
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,330
interesting not anything I would
everyone in a radio

87
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,590
but there it is and a little bit a
investigation

88
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,220
googling arm kinda let me know why
somebody would want that

89
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,660
I'm not play a video in kind give you
guys the rat hole

90
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:50,660
they got me involved in this and will
take

91
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,820
I have but the audio college

92
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,290
to an external volume appear

93
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:08,290
he did this is too quiet

94
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:32,260
be a long one with no idea track

95
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:06,660
we have in the right places calling

96
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,630
hold the mic up to the speaker's

97
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:16,630
really like that's fabulous

98
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:30,090
K the course

99
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,150
text

100
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:48,150
not much to look at just

101
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,720
harassed

102
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:11,950
and EP scant

103
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:18,950
electronic ways for hard

104
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,660
everyone Sao

105
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:29,660
fellows ya

106
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,708
left

107
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:42,750
are going to Radio Shack

108
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:49,750
fine it's a little hard

109
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,300
I hatched mean yard

110
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,399
%uh

111
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,480
for if I like in the sky

112
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:16,480
thank you steps

113
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,750
yeah

114
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:32,750
them fast

115
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:43,790
crossed thank you

116
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,420
for tho

117
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:07,420
theory to free to make fun

118
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:19,910
tho

119
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,469
them

120
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:29,470
three shots them of

121
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,290
this big I don't watch much TV and I
shoulda

122
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,870
is apparently they use these things on
pop TV all the time on

123
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,750
there's a whole group ghost hunting
shows that have been out the last couple

124
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,480
years

125
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,080
take a very very scientific approach

126
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,790
of course the use %uh

127
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,370
and so the show up a lot in recorders
various meters and things that can

128
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,030
detect

129
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,900
arm this is really interesting to me

130
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,430
I mean this is this is almost magnetic
rate this is just kind of people

131
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,960
passing the idea over the Internet and
with a little bit construction hang out

132
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,900
on my living room

133
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:21,610
my arm I want to look into the history
this when I started asking people online

134
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,780
about it turns out that the history

135
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,400
to EV PT using this type technology is
more than

136
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,150
college arm and so I really want to
crack into this and see where it came

137
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,680
from

138
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,670
I can't go the whole way through it but
roughly

139
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,500
%uh post-civil war up through the 1920s

140
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,050
spiritualism very big in the US there
were saying Ops is

141
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,330
on they were mediums in communicating
with the Dead was a pretty big part of

142
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,200
pop culture

143
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:56,200
I have really determine why I'm sure
other at the same time this is an

144
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,550
interesting

145
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,600
air and technology history rates above
our biggest inventions are kinda in that

146
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,140
era

147
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,280
and of course when you think about these
inventors

148
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,380
thomas edison you're doing something
that nobody's ever seen before

149
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:16,380
must must seem a little bit like a
medium or like talking to get so what's

150
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,780
the difference

151
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:22,640
are one other pieces and apology really
interesting was people

152
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,170
I had decided the Thomas edison was

153
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,979
later in his life building a telephone
to talk to the dead

154
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,200
rain and I found this badass little

155
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,500
quote outta a Scientific American

156
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,710
he says I've been thinking for some time
in the machine or apparatus

157
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,970
which could operate by personalities
which have passed on

158
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,260
to another existence or spear and the
whole community just hold

159
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,460
sup its been around forever there'd been
read people working on radius to talk to

160
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,620
the dead since the beginning

161
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,990
radius is to be and electricity um later
on in the same article

162
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,070
he says you know I don't claim that our
personalities pass on to another

163
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,040
existence

164
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,630
I don't claim anything because I don't
know anything about the subject

165
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,310
%uh which kinda tells me that the
probably the reporter the guy who was

166
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,670
asking him questions

167
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:16,920
want to know what he thought about this
thing that was oliver pop media I

168
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,950
tusla Tesla gets called out for this

169
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,590
all the time %uh marconi gets called out
for this all the time

170
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:28,630
I believe I firmly believe that these
guys when they were getting into the

171
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,170
beginnings

172
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,490
radio we're hearing signals that they
could not explain and the price on a lot

173
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,320
like voices

174
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,580
and they may have even been voices name
even been voices from

175
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,240
other people trained radio I really
believe that um

176
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,090
I could not find any evidence that test
or marconi believed that they were dead

177
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,410
people using radios

178
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,680
or using radio signals arm it

179
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,940
the funniest thing I found was a test
that came out at one point saying he

180
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,920
thought they were coming from mars which

181
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:03,920
to me is a little more believable 1920s
came about for some reason the

182
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,440
spiritualism in a in our culture

183
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,260
kinda it didn't and but it leaked out a
little bit

184
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,370
arm this is Harry Houdini arm

185
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,620
and again I couldn't pinpoint one reason
the cost that

186
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,940
I thought he was kinda interesting very
popular figure at the time

187
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,400
magician escape artist and apparently
early in his career when you can think

188
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,580
about is a musician

189
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:32,860
he was a medium right cell you can kinda
gets the truth behind that

190
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,160
on he went on later in his career to he
got a lot of joy out of taking the press

191
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,990
to say on scissor taking sometimes the
police to say on says

192
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,040
and debunking on so we get all over the
newspaper

193
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,390
on really interesting and his career and
I think in the late nineteen twenties I

194
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:49,890
think

195
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,939
we were probably ready for that on out
with

196
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,880
3some is history I know I L E start here
I am

197
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,810
as often happens in technology history
we skip over

198
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,820
the Great Depression know we were
spending money on consumer electronics a

199
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,540
consumer technology

200
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,020
%uh and we skip over one or two because
there was only one

201
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,610
30 spending a lot of money on these
technologies um and we'll just

202
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,190
jump past all that arm

203
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,720
the sky here is Friedrich jorgensen I'm

204
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,550
gonna try to play some clips his in a
lot of these characters I bring up speak

205
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,510
German

206
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,310
if you know German in you and I'm
missing the point something please hit

207
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,630
me up later I'd like to find out more
about it

208
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,170
um jorgensen was Swedish filmmaker

209
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,190
are they consider him the father a VPS
the first person to release stumble into

210
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:40,960
this

211
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,240
apparently its sole his story goes are
so the way he tells a story

212
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,160
he was making a film and you want to
record up for Twitter

213
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,709
for the soundtrack and Phil I'm so he
goes off to a summer home or wherever an

214
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,930
off into the fields

215
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,330
in takes a tape recorder an analog tape
recorder in

216
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,680
starts recording birds and when he plays

217
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,040
back he thinks he hears his name

218
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,000
%ah when I talk about the fee in the
beginning I talked about the clouds and

219
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,480
I think we all do that we often can't
see images where images

220
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,920
happen there's an audio version about
the fini and I think probably

221
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,970
everybody's experience

222
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,230
you're pounding away at important email
your typing something in your phone rang

223
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,000
and you check your phone it in makes

224
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,140
or something in the other room caught
your name and then you you finish

225
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,560
doing he say what what like what I think
I

226
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,780
me um I was camping many years ago down
in georgia

227
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,130
and not there was this little bird nice
where was going she

228
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,140
burger and anybody let's stop

229
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,040
mason-dixon knows bird Carolina wren
cheeseburger

230
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,400
great on so we have this ideal version
this so I firmly believe he

231
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,630
heard his name on the state's rate on he
got a little obsessed with it

232
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,300
and he taped tape and tape in taped and
he started listening not to when he was

233
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,050
taping but what was in between what he
was taping

234
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,550
and he'd take the bits silence that was
in between sounds audio sound

235
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,089
and he record into another tape player
so he can if I am

236
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:16,990
and many take that one amplify it again
and so forth and now he's will see two

237
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,530
little pieces have static that sound an
awful lot like people talking

238
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,060
up so much so he wrote a book about

239
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:31,419
rate this one's I voice transmissions
with the deceased the English version I

240
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,210
think was published in eighty-one there
might have been an earlier version

241
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,270
that um this is a pretty big deal

242
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,460
I wanna play a little piece in this so
you can get a sense what

243
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,290
these voices sound like seeking here you
know maybe what

244
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:49,409
up %uh

245
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:54,150
mammoth data this one hit me up later
for there is a german documentary called

246
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,700
Lasky

247
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,730
to Eternity that was about him on as a
father

248
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,380
VVP I have no idea what he's saying but
I

249
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,790
I can get estimate from hearing other
tapes like this in English

250
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:11,790
are and it gives you a sense of what he
heard

251
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,050
markets Norma dresses dodge or garage

252
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:22,050
the

253
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,740
movie night here years other than 300
cash

254
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,530
is and Dubai all but it kinda long-form
sockets and long

255
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:37,530
behind the

256
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,070
who the

257
00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:01,489
the high life Leah the

258
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:03,599
its three %ah free

259
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,779
kept calling EP culture two things he'll

260
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:10,139
hear over and over a threat to rest my
downers

261
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:15,429
people firmly believe that you can
actually hear these places

262
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:18,969
and that you have to learn a skill to
hear them to hear what they're saying

263
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:21,299
and so the two things that happen a lot

264
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:26,070
is people like to one slow them down to
repeat them over and over and over

265
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,708
phenomenal right and if you hear
anything 15 times I think you'll start

266
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:34,309
to hear something else or

267
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:39,869
hard up I'll jump forward a little bit
this is

268
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:43,488
this is another character in this kind
of long history constantine right

269
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:49,359
right dev is Latvian I'm sure and punch
right right the

270
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,320
arm he encounter Jorgensen's

271
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,559
up book was really interested in he was
is a

272
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,820
he was a psychologist Latin psychologist
%uh

273
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,428
I think where he was most interested in
was how serious the guy was

274
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:07,149
right he he firmly believe that
underneath that the guy might be a

275
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:07,849
skeptic

276
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:11,629
and that he really believed experience
this up so he

277
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:16,519
went to meet him and have an EP session
with and needed a session

278
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,779
and he couldn't hear anything he could
not hear the spices right

279
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:23,450
and they talk talk talk to me still
really believed

280
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:29,679
in this believed that targets and so he
started thinking about ways to extract

281
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,459
audio added the signals so that your
only left with that

282
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:39,059
that other noises that we're trying to
get he published

283
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:43,599
a series circuits for other people start
experimenting with up

284
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,309
three different circuits they get
referred to nowadays is

285
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:51,629
the road dev diode receiver %uh they're
fairly interesting

286
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:58,629
up one ready

287
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:21,710
pick up on possible that the tape
recorder itself

288
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,440
my right some kind of harmonics in there

289
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:33,190
and like stories about radioing so

290
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,759
this may be the receiver or they may
have been using

291
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:40,059
really good or bad tape recorders

292
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:45,639
to do this on radio people are probably
already laughing about this

293
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:49,419
%uh circuit on the right crystal radio

294
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:54,989
very early history radio a non powered
radio receiver no batteries is cool

295
00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:59,869
stuff right and radio waves to come from
a radio transmitter that I intentionally

296
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:05,549
broadcast 3ds oil

297
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:08,739
bird

298
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:11,869
audio dot headphones are doing
amplifiers

299
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:17,279
our boy they look suspiciously similar
teacher arm

300
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,329
and I think deep underneath it all and
especially later in his career I think

301
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:26,399
you realize that he reinvented the radio
to talk to the debt

302
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:30,729
but the radio on interestingly I did
some %ah

303
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:34,659
formula trying to figure out what
frequencies the original designs were on

304
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:37,690
all over the map on the most common one

305
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,989
is well below the AM band where we don't
really

306
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:44,429
do much down there supposedly I'm in
world war two day

307
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:48,669
the transmit submarines and things like
that yella

308
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:51,710
submarines

309
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:58,710
this they still that's interesting got
art like all these guys have published a

310
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:01,389
book

311
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:05,149
up something to that

312

313
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:10,769

I play faster

317
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,009
such a storyteller I'll play a little

318
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:38,450
German

319
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,609
and left again some me time we're about

320
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:45,759
terribly fact a voice

321
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,369
later identified as that of a mad live
and died

322
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:52,389
in a place called can buy in the Black
Forest

323
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,789
Germany said not

324
00:23:55,789 --> 00:24:02,789
out but have fun can I tho

325
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:06,019
start to really sad

326
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:10,049
and my tho German

327
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:14,329
wait for wat up from Kevin pop

328
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:19,379
a voice call later on today yes joystick
churchill makes

329
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:25,009
that he would be on the race

330
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:29,899
seems what are the things that happened
around this time

331
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:33,200
no fine pretty interesting is %ah

332
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,339
people started to get criticism about
the real connection

333
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:39,399
are and what I've read over and over is
that

334
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:43,169
people believe that that was actually
good thing right and that this external

335
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:44,389
noise

336
00:24:44,389 --> 00:24:48,329
are helps us to find missing parts and
information that we can't quite

337
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:51,889
here on this is referred to in other

338
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:55,419
sciences casting residents for you add

339
00:24:55,419 --> 00:24:58,819
she you add noise in the data set to be
on

340
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:03,960
to get the doubt it'd be more apparent
I'll

341
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,899
that came out in nineteen seventy winer
went to English in 1971

342
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:11,779
and I not coincidentally this gentleman
william o'neill

343
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:15,659
I he was a radio amateur he was an
electronics repairman

344
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:19,869
he did radio in the Navy before that on
he started using I

345
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:23,579
shortwave single sideband receiver I

346
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:26,960
special shortwave receiver that he could

347
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,079
communicate with the dead now he would
talk out loud and then the deadwood

348
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:34,969
radio 2 right he had a little help
designing the system then easy using

349
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:35,969
this is a picture

350
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:39,809
one in the iterations operate here I and
he was helped by this man

351
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:43,079
this is George Mueller George Miller
work for nasa

352
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:46,119
right so this must have been pretty
important stuff on

353
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:51,339
the only real catch being %uh George
Miller died four years earlier

354
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:54,668
up and apparently %uh

355
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:59,739
apparently o'neill could already talk to
the dead before the radio business came

356
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,789
about they were just telling him how to
make it so

357
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:05,309
other people could hear right this makes
at

358
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:08,960
of there's a sky kinda help them out
with the he discovered on this

359
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,159
this gentleman George meek on George
make

360
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,719
I was the president's something called
medical science foundation

361
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:20,229
and he went and he did research
experiments with O'Neill for many years

362
00:26:20,229 --> 00:26:24,829
in 1978 published manual so other people
could start doing

363
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:28,928
on this has diagrammed tells you what
radius use it gives a lot

364
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:32,239
explanation up maybe the spiritual side
other

365
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:35,509
I gives a lot of just documentation and
interviews they had

366
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:40,659
dead people %uh I think my favorite
website this is one other receivers they

367
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:42,579
use this is the last one called the mark

368
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:45,690
for and prizes most well-known one

369
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,979
the batch and pilots familiar the radio
people again

370
00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:54,129
at one of the things I found most
interesting about this was I the

371
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:55,049
copyright notice

372
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:58,700
the copyright notice said there's no
copyright up what it said

373
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,469
is meek says I believe there are these
layers to the astral plane that you go

374
00:27:03,469 --> 00:27:03,979
to any

375
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:08,599
da and if you're the type of person
gonna rip off technology not

376
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:14,859
get stuck in the red the one that best
copyright pages I never seen the spirit

377
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:17,069
spare car manuals online

378
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:20,729
I think I missed from our

379
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:23,919
this isn't Diana how to mark

380
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:30,919
the

381
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:55,339

390
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,669

391
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:38,970
yes

392
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,149

393
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:48,149
rather for

394
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:54,639

395
00:28:54,639 --> 00:28:58,279
course up tell your name in a book

396
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:02,070
of there's another guy

397
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:07,289
I close up for a quick Stephen Rourke
Art Bell fans may recognize that name

398
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:10,370
I he's one of the people who collected
evidence for

399
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:13,639
I'd I think he just collected evidence I
don't think he had an opinion

400
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:16,870
on you know US hopes the moon landing
%uh

401
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,590
he didn't really believe in the spear
comin he did a lot of research on the

402
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,909
spear come to figure out

403
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:26,010
you know what was really going on here
I'll he found out a couple things

404
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:30,529
there were documents videotapes a phony
all this is that the and the one in the

405
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:31,110
tapes

406
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,370
it turns out O'Neill was a practice
ventriloquist

407
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:38,919
and was really good having conversations
with I

408
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:43,370
there was some other evidence to that on
he also notice that O'Neill

409
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:47,850
never had his never faced the camera the
Auris hatchback

410
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,889
yes here

411
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:57,889
day he also thought that O'Neill night
on the stink on electro larynx

412
00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:01,830
and none something they recognized sound
us

413
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:08,100
damaged when you pull a couple more
audio

414
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,049
up this is

415
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:15,740
work found better-quality tapes in the
ER

416
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:21,330
here excuse me sir I believe me I don't
know I wish I could share all my head

417
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,399

418
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,779

see if he could now

424
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,330
team sounds I'm going to read

425
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:55,070
a brief passage for you I'll

426
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:59,780
with the electro larynx held in front

427
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:06,780
I'll my lip way

428
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,150
I

429
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:17,640
I don't know if I completely trust all
the works research that

430
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,800
that's kinda interesting right there on
he

431
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,040
the he had some other %uh things that he
dredged up

432
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,129
he thought that George meet here was a
in cahoots with a knee all that this is

433
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:30,750
of eight

434
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,910
on Jim McDonald mcdonnell-douglas

435
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,960
was pouring fifty grand into this
project

436
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,040
%ah the spear calms you could buy one
for 10 grand

437
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,170
I'm so there's a lot of money to be had
in here on

438
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,390
in through the seventies which is kinda
interesting on he also thought that

439
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:53,300
%uh me quiz in cahoots with Aryana
Department justice

440
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,580
the CIA the FBI on

441
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,300
I don't know why an years organizations
would want ghosts to talk to us

442
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,790
but he believed it I N E

443
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:08,530
any filed for a freemen Information Act
they actually had records on the guys

444
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,840
and there's something out there I've
never seen any other

445
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,860
the product results fashion

446
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:21,180
already I'll take a lot faster hi I
Shriver 1985 I'll

447
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:26,090
retired guy last for his late four years
in his life he discovered that he could

448
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:26,980
bend spoons

449
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,810
on he got injured in San recording a
little bit he heard voices when the

450
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:31,899
voices here

451
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,250
said class working on television

452
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,060
so he decided he'd better get a TV
camera and start figuring out how to

453
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,659
receive

454
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,650
I love these folks believe that the
other side

455
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,870
were scientists building talked

456
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:52,130
really believed any a couple times
mentions things like

457
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,360
up

458
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,780

I don't know why for search

466
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,300

469
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,720
this is kinda the same way I feel about
the radio like

470
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,390
on this is a movie star Austrian actress

471
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,890
Romney Snyder never be movie starring TV

472
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:16,889
are americanism yeah

473
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:23,110
oh yeah yeah

474
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:27,090
it did doesn't derail other Einstein

475
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,190
theoretically up this is the I can live
with the second about

476
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,670
area no I country are

477
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:39,540
I had a bypass these I think this image
is a pretty strong I have the

478
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,190
there are some samples you can find on
the internet this coming in the

479
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,159
actualization

480
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:50,159
up a move forward to about 1995 2000 on
this is a guy named Frank sumptin

481
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:57,370
like frankly in the room still alive of
he's a radio amateurs he got interested

482
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,220
in

483
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,630
this pop electronics article from 1995
we could build your own

484
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,930
August receiver and tomorrow i

485
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,710
time after four o'clock and giving a
workshop to do that modified its even

486
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,540
attached to your

487
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,290
iPhone or an Android phone and see if
the hotel Pennsylvania

488
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:19,970
on it com I anytime for 7 I'll be down
there doing that

489
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,810
based off the circuit %uh he built one
in these and it didn't work

490
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:28,430
I N E do it on a shelf into that five
years later he started thinking about it

491
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:32,930
any hopped around the internet on he
found some software called the VP maker

492
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,890
its tree you can download it what it
does is it records are you coming in its

493
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,540
place is unknown million pieces

494
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,570
and then the ghosts spirits can reorder
say

495
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,690
right so if this idea pulling random bit

496
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:48,480
coming back reordering them
intelligently hot

497
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,920
and he went about doing a radio %uh

498
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,650
he's get called frank's boxes he's know
almost two hundred of them

499
00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:02,650
are they're pretty interest at a diagram
a wonderful diagrams change

500
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,440
pricey

501
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,280
as you can gas but he's made again

502
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,630
a over a hundred of them almost 200 are

503
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:53,230
Solomon is a little bit collect the cash

504
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,470

505
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:01,050
online activities going on right now

get a chance to talk about this is a

522
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,880
fairly new idea

523
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,160
where are random electromagnetic

524
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,339
energy collected on an on to an antenna
goes to a tiny voice processor and spits

525
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:19,600
out

526
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,009
when a decision might

527
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:30,010
