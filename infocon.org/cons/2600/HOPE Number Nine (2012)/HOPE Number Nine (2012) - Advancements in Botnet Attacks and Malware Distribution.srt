1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,180
the stock and first of all I really
wanna tank all-conference far along the

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:04,770
seine

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,840
opportunity to discuss about the our
research and share the views

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,469
so and I'm gonna talk about like it lost
Lennon botnet attacks on the mound for

5
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:14,820
distribution strategies

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,750
so a bigger bag on/off first like this
research has been collaborated done

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,310
Michael eyes trained on my friend and
like second she's got a relapse

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,779
and apart from that it's like governor
open walk and over research that we do

9
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,930
and the I used to work for like

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,630
at the back and as a contractor for a
scary companies

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,090
as and i'm looking for. I said partners
and so this just slid back down on me

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,250
and that gives you an idea what I do and

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,829
morality does so I'm also a PhD
candidate at Michigan State University

14
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:51,360
so sorry going to talk about today

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,670
s like now the paradigm we gonna look at
the browser Malik exxon ami

16
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,420
because understanding a taxonomy is
really quiet

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,309
to look at demand a refund different
perspective for example if you wanna do

18
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:04,789
so

19
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,450
and if you wanna design is some rather
sick got any %uh protection mechanisms

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,479
against malware we need to billed as and
attend redline

21
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,159
that actually differentiates between the
different classes of malware

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,470
actually black suspender batter
opportunity to understand what lies

23
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,539
at the poor other crap something out so
we gonna talk about

24
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,240
the present-day Mali propagation tactics
and

25
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,899
I'm gonna run some dominos and at last
we gonna talk about information still

26
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,750
intact is

27
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,939
maybe it got exhortation strategies used
by the bottlenecks nowadays

28
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:42,250
and a bit of inclusion so before
starting the concept that i'm gonna

29
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,840
discuss in the stock up on a selected a
platter of

30
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,509
things that bought master the botnet saw
the ball to the different got him out

31
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,420
where users

32
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,509
and this really hot do you know but that
all that in all

33
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,100
sixty-minute stock but try my best to
pick up the past things

34
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,100
that are running pretty get nowadays and
that's how the botnet sexually

35
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,780
exploiting

36
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,790
da use this system sandy network at
abilities

37
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:13,069
this can decide so for Sat anything so
no worries a body here like

38
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:16,810
everything that walks in the mouth
airfield relates to these three

39
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,950
practice 6 like fear onset entity in
doubt

40
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,250
and if you look at from perspective of
psychology

41
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,660
and the like at the second psychology a
bot master

42
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,810
are any attacker you find the tried to
exploit

43
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,120
wanna the other tanks I if you can see
an example of social engineering

44
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,220
right and then you get an idea how this
looks like

45
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,250
user having the fear and

46
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,760
bad annoyed I don't open that perhaps I
don't act like that lange

47
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,000
and it comes like a setting you will
happen I'm in effect like that delaying

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I go to app side if I use this software
if I run this app let

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,810
some things like that and a doubt yeah
you don't know

50
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,069
was going to happen in your system so
all these things

51
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:05,780
which use qualified it looks pretty well
from our perspective and

52
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,900
the bed I'm is the devil is in the
details

53
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,810
for example I do we analyze malware live
and the widest companies spend a lot of

54
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,260
money

55
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,179
research analyze and now the way to
build products building new signage is

56
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,209
is after the devil eyes I mean if they
want to look with there and do it.

57
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:22,110
sprouts

58
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,840
and they had to get the details
signatures to build family driven

59
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,760
protections

60
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,950
and that's how it looks and so in Forex
live in San as if you will

61
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,440
on tax law to one ability you need to
get into the details on that one ability

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,609
so

63
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,129
from perspectif allies and bartender tax
we have to simulate those attacks on we

64
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:43,980
have to run that in emulators to see how
it looks

65
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,299
to get in a better understanding of the
scenario so but that's a tote

66
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,900
and their sidewalks in every fear now

67
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,739
that's what I used to call a reality of
the Internet I mean talking about that

68
00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:58,830
actor spot masters perspective

69
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,680
and you look at other scenarios and many
people drive next flight network

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,080
infrastructures

71
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,560
and thus are like for example they wanna
run bought matching

72
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,849
collaboration prosthetics like backs and

73
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:14,069
try to exploit the user-driven
reconnaissance on the client side

74
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,269
and solid things like that I mean the
anonymous

75
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,489
they are hidden you don't know what is
happening at the back end

76
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:24,680
and what you see is like is a solid
gifts typical example of social

77
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,639
engineering attacks

78
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,860
for another example you can declare you
like you were talking to your friend on

79
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,340
Facebook and you say only see that there
is an a message popup be

80
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,060
you wanna go here it is the link you
don't know what it comes from

81
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,040
right maybe the system is in fact dead
some things like that

82
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,210
that we're gonna see you later on but
that is the truth and that is the

83
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,659
reality of Internet

84
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,070
dates now let's jump back

85
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,520
back onto the Concepcion like before
talking and providing some other malware

86
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,440
distribution strategies Elena

87
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,690
in a span like five to seven minutes on
this the browser ballot exxon any

88
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,840
exxon a me actually we're all that paper
for Elias bulletin

89
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,699
last year and then actually gives you an
idea how the browser peace matter what

90
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:12,620
the a Sydney plus the specification this
is the kind of malware that actually

91
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,970
installs and the browser itself

92
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,300
for example Malaysia extensions that
I've been to in to perform like man in

93
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,470
the middle

94
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,520
replica of my back if you use to call it
the man in the browser

95
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,930
but it looks very fine I made his axe in
the browser process

96
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,550
so it can send a private address space
on the browser and it can

97
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,310
hot mess alda properties of the browser
process

98
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,350
and of course is it is going to
communicate well with the different

99
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,970
browser compliments

100
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,030
and that's what we have seen be sent the
next year the concept from browser to

101
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:50,820
gives game and that's actually belong to
the class a browser mouse

102
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,870
talking about the Class B I mean so what
it actually looks

103
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,289
for example browser provides Cena and
added functionality of

104
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,289
different kind of things here for
example a

105
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:04,800
collaborating with other set of software
for example plugin frameworks

106
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,990
it all the flash Sailor like Jolla

107
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,050
in order to you know harness the power
of browser the really need to get into

108
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,940
the psyche texture

109
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,060
and glass bead browser matter
specifically exploits the plugin

110
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,990
architecture for example ability

111
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,180
and I'll be blogging while evaluating
flash

112
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,440
Google that compromise and i can say
grasp onto on competition

113
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,469
and so that's a visit flight is but if
you ask me like

114
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,020
plugin runs in a separate a dressed
basis in a separate process and be

115
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,639
but they're running aside in a sandbox
environment this fine i mean because

116
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,259
that

117
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:44,220
the complex T is an outcome of the
interdependency among reduce compliments

118
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,960
air

119
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,620
like for example running a fan at all be
in the browser it has to be

120
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,960
interdependent with the browser

121
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,910
communication flow between used to all
the interprocess communication

122
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,970
and that's how it actually looks so
anyone the ability

123
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,410
in a plugin frameworks is very well
exploded and excite

124
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,919
results in compromise on the browser

125
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,280
suck the gets back onto the classy
browser malware

126
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,599
so in this particular scenario this
glass of Malbec typically used to say

127
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,770
like and use the land route case

128
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,229
and it has a relation within a class be
browser mouth and because

129
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:23,810
attackers tried to exploit along the
ability in plugins and then downloads SS

130
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,569
as it set a malware onto your system and
that's how it works

131
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:30,900
if you look at the diamond ball so the
malware that we have presented their

132
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,210
like it has an inter

133
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,349
relation are you there is an interface
between the browser process and

134
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:37,319
operating system kernel

135
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,550
so the user and rootkits activity use
format in the browser

136
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,599
attacks and excite Barbara mites and

137
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:48,090
if you look at and then this and this
and now you hoping locks and operating

138
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:48,810
system

139
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,599
that saw it actually implementing the
Contessa browser

140
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:56,250
being ages and would get and a browser
runs and then I'll user application

141
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,220
space

142
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,289
and their side gotta hope different
functions in the browser and i'd

143
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:04,250
many places that's all demanded the
browser walks

144
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,819
so let's talk about a bad for Life Sci
kit

145
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:12,199
and this all the cases that I am going
to discuss on this stock is like

146
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,009
taken from the previous case studies
that we have done and Islamic another

147
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:18,699
case study that we analyze for the
blackhole exploit

148
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,919
back dole I mean it was 10 da

149
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,719
most fellowships I would say like the
most robust like a

150
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,069
exploit back which is being used
holidays though they were like

151
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:32,919
fanning six light back either kinda pics
like banks reserve your

152
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,039
and nowadays nuclear exploit back is
running pretty fine

153
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,189
so been sitting this in this scenario is
like

154
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,370
any attacker are if you were attacked
their of anybody like a bot massive the

155
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,360
try to exploit a one ability in
high-traffic web site

156
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,000
Street Journal as we all idea is to like
to get the traffic I mean

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,410
because I slept broad-base attacks would
you use to flawless and I started

158
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,610
targeted attack

159
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,320
in this and now you from botnet
perspective

160
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,209
so the x-lite eliminating high-traffic
website looks pretty fine

161
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,110
now they want to serve mouth because the
user that is coming onto that backside

162
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,279
make some lengths and get that
information

163
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,279
next step is just inject malicious
iframe

164
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,070
if you wanna more sale T I know things
you can obvious can't it be fine

165
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,440
national thing is so so the snack just
that I provided his like from the

166
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,269
analysts first

167
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:28,970
perspective some other scripts that we
had to thank us on the so this cat is

168
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,279
actually extracting the steps because I
don't like secured that Gordon my

169
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:32,990
browser

170
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,529
I don't open that back page in my
browser by simply shook a monarchy

171
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:38,920
extract the scripts on that page for me

172
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,680
seed extract it and I say us saw that
been I was doing that alice is for this

173
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,490
one

174
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,860
like there is a board game up and there
was any malicious kept inside it

175
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,760
then you can do like you can also use an
A in bed the next library is called girl

176
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,730
W get to get doubtful source Beach
downloaded onto your

177
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:03,560
alice is she what happens when you see
that and the obvious gave escape strings

178
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,060
lot of other things and get an idea that
Emily she's jail at latest air

179
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,579
and that looks very fine see if you
wanna look at an alice is the

180
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:14,980
the slice will be released later on you
can look at the widest total plug in and

181
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,589
see how that works

182
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,339
but if you get that idea a selected is
that like Doc Johnson need to decompile

183
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:20,779
it

184
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:24,019
just Decompiler then each other the
compiler and

185
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:28,380
and on John 25 send you get an A idea
that there's any salsa downloading the

186
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,430
ELS all-star txt

187
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,010
so I'm not face an irregular execute
able but you can see some malicious exit

188
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,000
execute a bill that is actually using a
filename up the been does

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,399
login process there's a sauce we used to
call

190
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,649
and if you remember in all your days
like around the lake Windows hacking

191
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:47,149
exposed was released

192
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,640
she so they have in a fake Gina and
ideologically hoax and do this as last

193
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,010
process to

194
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,350
inaki of all your own windows login
credentials

195
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,300
but that the how to use it i mean
because they want to use the legitimate

196
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,440
processes of

197
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,690
process names of various vendors bind
resend in this process is

198
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,279
K November Decompiler jalloud let me get
an idea like

199
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,850
that job up there is actually using a
VBScript code in it

200
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,329
and you know let me be skipping all is
being enough us preference

201
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:21,360
for the attack in southern bought Mart
states to exploit to

202
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,310
into Skype site again isn't send-up
adesso it actually looks

203
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,079
sought it actually a game that their
father is there and it actually

204
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,140
dollars execute the course and the user
can simply

205
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,610
all the shell function story be scrapped
and

206
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,079
it looks and your system is infected

207
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,670
but that so actually why actually I've
applied to this matter lights like a

208
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,420
scenario from John explode because

209
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,979
if you doing an alice is now a days you
select most of the systems that got

210
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,430
compromised

211
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,160
odd because of the gel-like slights I
mean the latest one is a Jolla

212
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,829
Ari exploit and it it looks pretty find

213
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:05,170
loading of that militia sports boss onto
the victim machine is free

214
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,810
and now now look at the know we gonna
talk about the strategies like called

215
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,139
implant now we're

216
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:14,209
we used to call a boss and the present
the propagation tactics because

217
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:17,889
I'm going to talk about like phishing
attacks shingle Xperia fishing

218
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:21,610
exploiting the some open SMTP relay
service and sort of things like that

219
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,820
things that change from that perspective
and if you talk about phishing attacks

220
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,820
this still exist and a bill to land on
the Internet because that's weird

221
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,610
sexy exploits the default design about
but

222
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,690
the passage of time things have changed
a bit without will come up new proxy be

223
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,209
softer and

224
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:43,620
much Austin kinda sad now use texas
chainsaw

225
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,389
miss talking about like exploding bad
costing like we did not study entry to

226
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:49,649
find that

227
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:53,190
attackers not only 1x like the high
traffic volume website for the

228
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:57,339
typically want to exploit the cervix
which are doing that what you're hosting

229
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:01,060
because consider a scenario am in your a
one particular server

230
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,260
is hosting a 500 web sites

231
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,160
and one map site has Anna Iowa ability
for example you get them

232
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,380
normally she s file uploading
functionality is the air

233
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,899
just not restricted are there some sort
of per day she has actually gained

234
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:19,519
decorate with a compromise thought that
particular count on me

235
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,970
Sarah machine but the idea behind washer
machine is that

236
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,220
one website is compromised you can't
build escapes like that for example

237
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,040
automated iframe injector and if you run
that iframe injector in the context of

238
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,469
the Hosni

239
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,649
ought to be the cause of are hospital
lighting

240
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:42,720
but that typically used to call a
backside which is Austin on a server

241
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,260
and then iframe injector actually in Jax

242
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,199
different kind of iframe said all the
hosting website

243
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,510
on that bus system so for example one
website is compromise is fine

244
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:59,660
i mean but what's with the other other
securities also got compromised

245
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,790
and Ben Reece yesterday some RB

246
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,670
nice people I despair likes a rest day
for awhile i costing panels and things

247
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,320
like that some other sliwa abilities
like cooking a replay attacks

248
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,459
and the five hashes and things like that

249
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:18,670
game to exist and the replay attacks you
can access to the housing panel

250
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,889
and things like that looks pretty good
Ando of course if you got an access to

251
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:25,190
the Austin panel their lot of emails

252
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:30,079
and emailing list going on the people
use to discuss about their username and

253
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,220
passwords

254
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,600
and from that perspective you also get
to compromise the server

255
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,360
so these a difference and now use but
the line is like with compromise on the

256
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,339
one back side you can compromise the
halls around then

257
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,940
in fact thanks in a distributed manner

258
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,029
and that in the 70 script that we found
that 1 I'd

259
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:52,620
attacker was using and that is actually
a bash script

260
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,620
region and I think see a say it actually
triggers the automated iframe injection

261
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,010
in have revamp side that has been
hosting on this server basically index

262
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,600
on HTML page

263
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,350
things like that and this walks the fine

264
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,190
things that change they everything is
getting automated

265
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,750
and again we find like this is a all we
know that

266
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,990
they use to upload different kind of c99
shells which actually automates the

267
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,360
process of

268
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,779
administrating not compromise server and
it actually gives you an idea that once

269
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:25,720
the uploader that

270
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,370
icon dislike c99 shahar other sort of
like

271
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,130
more about the administration's shells
on the bomb from my summer you can do

272
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:38,670
much more thanks and because all
centralize you access the PHP web page

273
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,329
can you get all information about this
are you can execute commands and things

274
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:43,300
like that

275
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,029
so the game comes from the infections
and now you are

276
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:51,910
which we discussed area like exploiting
that costing

277
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,410
and and other artistically essay llegas
a very interesting technique

278
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:01,399
%uh the use of like proxies I'm for
example inside an organization may you

279
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,339
find that you don't have an arrest

280
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:08,250
access to Facebook another solid domains
because they have an app blacklist

281
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,149
implemented on the client side I may be
on the server side and in the long baggy

282
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:13,730
paid on I'll

283
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,800
is not allow you to do those things
that's where the user's actually do they

284
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,750
tried to

285
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,550
open a big lie proxy happiest some beer
on the internet

286
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,509
and this I think like when we doing this
study there like

287
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:30,540
the summer the other researchers have
done like studies on BlackRock's is cell

288
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,089
like one of the done in like people
really since and sexually

289
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:38,389
rejected shows that Hall insecure the
black boxes I because people just simply

290
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:39,459
Halsted

291
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:42,930
and then advertise a donde el

292
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,480
adlai proxies infrastructure they have
like a one particular domain where you

293
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,720
can advertise your black proxy

294
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,410
and then the people RT users go there
and find it okay to use this guy proxy

295
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,670
and the open it and then start doing
that thing moment we analyze the things

296
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,779
we try to

297
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:03,070
do you need it by proxy into attack you
know

298
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:07,890
baptized basically try to weaponize is
by proxy from that perspective

299
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,620
and when we did like we did team that by
proxy and got an idea like it is still

300
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,650
possible

301
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,939
to inject malicious things typically a
malicious scripts on

302
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:21,850
all the proxy fight back pages what that
actually means I use it open the page

303
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,010
and approx is going to read I told the
URL's

304
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,850
and everything based on that and menu
redone love and a black box is actually

305
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,260
does allow page

306
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,370
it will inject some malicious script and
it

307
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,730
and that is like very disastrous because
assemble into the blackhole exploit back

308
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,340
and do the things I use a still feels
that okay I'm using Google I proxy is

309
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,070
I'm anonymously surfing the tanks

310
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,340
and other stuff and by just got in fact
it

311
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,039
one other thing is that they can also
inject escapes that actually excellent

312
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:52,900
trade data

313
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,130
that I'm going to demonstrate on a run I
V you just saw after that

314
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,490
and you will see that how it looks
because im

315
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,840
proxies what you can do you can turn out
like caught planking

316
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,049
things like that and you configured in
such a way that you won't get up

317
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:10,410
like status boss boss man you are
accessing the lappy job like proxies

318
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,080
and then actually makes things a bit
more anonymous and let's take a look at

319
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,120
it

320
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,429
so this third amo that gives you an idea
how logs

321
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:27,720
a the study that I was discussing about
the sense one day also

322
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,150
released on information that how
insecure these day proxies are

323
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,970
and if you go on internet and tried to
do some googling Darkwing and do some

324
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,130
prude forcing you will

325
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,919
easily get access to black proxies there
are available on the Internet

326
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,370
and and the fact is that is that

327
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,410
if they're not be used to run lock

328
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,860
monitoring the can is a medley back and
so whatever you send

329
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,860
is gonna get logged at the proxy and
again from actor a decade perspective

330
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,370
they can get a lot of things like
surfing habits and the brewery see all

331
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,230
the users how they are actually going on
the internet and exploiting the things

332
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,880
so what we're doing here is that we
actually compromise the law not the

333
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,130
lie proxy and conducted a small gas

334
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,549
say if you look at this scenario what
this kept this parameter is going to do

335
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:16,110
that it actually going to inject energy
Cherie

336
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,429
a small plugin that we don't like file
for 56

337
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:24,100
lines it actually going to inject that
jQuery plugin all the proxy fight back

338
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:29,059
pages

339
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:33,220
less a man accuses actually accessing
the page it looks like this

340
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,820
and okay and but I was like Facebook

341
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,549
they won't go through

342
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:43,679
typically this guy props is actually has
an inbuilt plugin so you can surf

343
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:44,850
Facebook

344
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,110
and that have been used by the users a
lot

345
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:52,950
on the previous times so if you look at
this and now you're the user

346
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,169
has no idea I me this like I'm surfing
anonymous and my organization unknown

347
00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:01,970
not knowing about it and it looks so
what

348
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,580
we did actually we are not providing any
legitimate user name and password here

349
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:11,809
it just trying that Ben we summit the
login button on the POST request goes up

350
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:15,090
let's look at the source code

351
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,209
safe you go down you say that all these
links I read it in

352
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,360
by the URL writing bug you love the guy
proxies

353
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,640
and %um at the bad at the end you will
see that this

354
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,210
the script is actually get inside it in
every Backpage

355
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,690
so what this kid was dual Xeon you some
eating anything

356
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,919
is actually picking that bullshit best
and sending into the another command and

357
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:37,799
control server

358
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:41,490
arianna maybe the server that is costing
like proxy

359
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,120
and let's look at the log file

360
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,159
as it is a poor record which we used to
just redirect all

361
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:53,010
incoming information on duty

362
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:58,080
fly so this is the file we actually got
and you see that we have the email

363
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,270
password

364
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,789
and things like that

365
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:06,549
so this way easy I mean how you
typically when you are accessing any

366
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:07,820
black proxy

367
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,149
on the public ever able internet how
you're going to build the trust

368
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:15,350
because this is Sumeet like explanation
oppressed boundary

369
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,650
and but in this loss while you people
are you just don't realize that they

370
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,630
simply access the things and they dont
they don't have any idea what is

371
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,610
happening at the back end

372
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,630
but thats that Angus so that's the when
we have no one down here

373
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,260
back to show that how the black boxes
can be manipulated

374
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,289
now

375
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:38,860
up with a screen shot because I want to
give you an idea like all the obfuscated

376
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,090
iframes I use to this game shot I took
from like malware domain list and

377
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,668
this actually gives you an idea like
attackers are simply using a lot of

378
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:48,010
obvious cation

379
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,890
and it's not that hard to reverse an
obvious cation is

380
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:56,400
easy and if you know they're like %ah
hotshots how to do it is very easy if

381
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,120
you understand the browser basically a

382
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,340
on doll model and all that things but
they sexy gives you an idea that obvious

383
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,928
getting iframe sock

384
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:08,200
being used at a pretty heavy scale

385
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,590
and that's what I wanna talk about like
it like a browser text like backs

386
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:16,230
typically bundled with an exploits up

387
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,659
and these bells the next life like is
the kind sort of like an hour

388
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:24,710
we used to call a PHP beast application
is running and my siegel et the back and

389
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,159
and have all sorts of pals X lice

390
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,159
bonded together into one place simple

391
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:34,659
scenario is like use it is going to send
a request

392
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:37,740
right and it actually companies with the
user agent string

393
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,929
rejecting gifts in a decade and have you
all what kind of environment

394
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:45,130
they use that is running after doing
that the

395
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,750
the actually finger bit printed
according to you running up like a

396
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,850
plugin .gs file the text you

397
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:55,179
fingerprint the kind apply concealer
running and then be so that pot

398
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:58,340
they actually get an information about
the environment

399
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,850
and the kind elections us all to defend
like constraining

400
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,289
on the blindside and if you %uh I
analyzed on the product at about the

401
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:07,919
same mysteries by the Qualys

402
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,120
the excuse calling a browser liking
detector

403
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,600
it actually really Faiza detector uses
the same concept

404
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,650
and checks the Wii DS one version of a

405
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,159
browser plug-ins the user is running and
then gets up and a notification

406
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:26,000
based on that so that actually gives you
an idea so this creature is taken from

407
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,990
on the compromise domain which actually

408
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,549
get see an idea that browse index like
back is used in

409
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:35,440
collaboration with the botnets says that
same server they are running a browser

410
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,360
xlite back

411
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,850
and defend one ability in browser to
successfully compromised

412
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,950
they deliver the bot and that's our

413
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,779
this walks say jus like different things

414
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:50,900
to applied analysis they actually finger
frame

415
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:55,809
also your IP address and subsea exploit
only once time so they don't want to

416
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,720
sound like different side of exploits

417
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,490
to the same IP address more than one
time but you can do that i mean you can

418
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,640
use an hour

419
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,059
for example you can and on my zits on
the client side and then

420
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:10,440
get to malware again and again

421
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,659
this screenshot gets you out idea about

422
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:17,400
Hall kinda obvious cation is being done
on the encoding

423
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,909
is being done on the server side so this
is love that page being

424
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:24,620
encoded using an I'm cue encoder solo de

425
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,990
they are actually a proactive indirect
routes like the attackers on the butt

426
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,890
master so when they're hosting this

427
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:33,610
browse xlite factory use the PHP I'm
cube encoder

428
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:38,409
and then go to all the files and is
there really hot I'm not a simple

429
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:41,740
possible this really hot deal i'd

430
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,679
the obvious k discord and get the real
thing saudis that's why we have to

431
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,070
emulate it and do the behavior based
testing

432
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,570
on it but if you

433
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,510
get an ID NC while performing analysis
you will see that the compromise sever

434
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:00,960
and you notice these kind of eyes on the
server side

435
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,330
and the which I've analyzed like last
year

436
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:08,299
looking at the broader like a browser
blackhole exploit back and I did I like

437
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:08,970
a a

438
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,760
to delete auburn brown blackhole exploit
back and won a split in conference last

439
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,919
year

440
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,090
and I analyze legged Alex lights on da

441
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:21,970
difficult ones and in last year it was
like a job I ascend p1 ability which was

442
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,190
exploiting the most

443
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,230
and at present time is the gala every
exploit if you

444
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:33,520
look at these file Amin solely excess
perform be obvious cation of five frames

445
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,950
and then try to access the call and we
get the idea like it's actually

446
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,460
downloading dollar-yen see plea or five

447
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,690
okay it's fine but we need to execute it
to see what is happening

448
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,049
how it is manipulating the five system
and resist reentry snack will be sin for

449
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:48,830
us

450
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,039
annette would be structure sense are
things like that but

451
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:56,299
it gives me an arrow that it's not like
that and a very simple thing and what we

452
00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:00,360
do in that matter in alice is to just
week the extensions

453
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,440
so what I did like we treat the
extension the air and we

454
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,220
change it from a B 52 the jar file and
then we'd be combated

455
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,620
and that's all we get back slide and it
was like gel SMB explain

456
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,039
so the ID are discussing about his all
factors like some of the

457
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,559
I me now issues to call a nice and board
said

458
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,510
one can use lighting analysis because
i've seen leg so my friends

459
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:26,840
left the analysis because they don't get
an idea like its Neda father started

460
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,580
liking

461
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,559
issues less but no you gonna tweak it
and then get the idea what is happening

462
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,039
at the back

463
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,770
and a game came across like cool last
six months this is being used

464
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:42,200
and on GTV it's like a drive-by
frameworks that automatically generates

465
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,590
the gala basics like Sen sucks you in
the malicious

466
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:50,220
Affleck's and by while you run it X
likes it shall I install on your client

467
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,409
side and then

468
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:55,059
you know your browser and sis n is
compromised and that's how it actually

469
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:56,178
looks

470
00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:00,950
so idea behind showing a snapshot is
like everything is getting automated

471
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:04,130
even though I package spot monsters they
don't have the enough time to do

472
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,289
everything manually

473
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:09,000
yet they do invest a lot of time in
designing the screen looks

474
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,830
but in the underground community also
the source code you can find

475
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,039
are you can take it from the previous
version for example

476
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:20,100
on in the spot net spy I took the
concept of

477
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,200
objects from there and I'll the the

478
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,890
latest luxury analyzing is Angie I
bought and then

479
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:30,240
there's an Andromeda and then this more
candid as EU

480
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,460
bah spot that's a some of them are also
a

481
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,279
unit taking the source code from that
perspective

482
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,980
little bit optimizing it tweaking it
according to their own design

483
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,340
but yeah it looks and actually gives you
i dnt screenshot actually gives you an

484
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,450
idea how many

485
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,710
infections occur to that

486
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,000
but it looks automated in faction frame
looks

487
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,429
other keating's nowadays

488
00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:01,440
Leslie take a look at this

489
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,039
back to give seal idea up about the fact
that why

490
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:11,230
drive-by downloads are so steal the and
the user is not able to get in

491
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:18,230
and actually gives you an idea that are
lots

492
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:23,130
selection redesign this feature from or
else in your like you log into your

493
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,669
email account you get: already

494
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:28,809
tempting email visit has enough fish a
sort of a steamy

495
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:33,639
and you click that email

496
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,940
a CR walks and of course you are a shock
news

497
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,320
see another good thing for optimizing
the URL's

498
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,350
but attackers a and the black narcissus
and also using it

499
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,640
specification early if you remember then
I G in Fishers

500
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,970
do a lot

501
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,970
so I did like adjuster around the
traffic monitoring

502
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,840
called on the client side to take to
give see the kind of you are outside

503
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,600
being accessed

504
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,039
so I logged in to my facebook account
it's just a malicious about page

505
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,640
and if you go down you will see that
this is Anna

506
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,000
very sophisticated the Eivissa like in a
sophisticated man died

507
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,960
the obvious Kate the cold really
compressed and optimized

508
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,580
I miss a noisy do you know the obvious
gated

509
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:27,149
but yeah if you didn't know you can
tweak the you out lol and vendors to a

510
00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:30,440
document for a meat is to just landed it

511
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,070
with our execution yes at this page
hazardous malicious

512
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:41,070
iframe

513
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:50,440
not take a look at data traffic I mean
they requested the HTTP request to get

514
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,179
in the polls that actually got issued
from the victim's machine

515
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:59,600
and you will analyze it in at two or
three different halts

516
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,889
out there but these all subsequent
request which actually

517
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:08,379
be issued by the iframe it because it
fetches the content from the malicious

518
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:09,049
domain

519
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:13,070
that actually hops from one domain to
the end of the domain and then actually

520
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,470
actually downloading them out there onto
your system but

521
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:20,720
still despite have time it's really hard
to notice by the system is infected or

522
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,009
not

523
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:26,450
but this traffic actually gives you an
idea that something is

524
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:33,450
dear so this was done on a

525
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,320
uninfected machinery random at the end
device

526
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,749
back to see if it fetches the infection
because it bad malicious iframe was

527
00:30:41,749 --> 00:30:43,320
actually downloading as the spot

528
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,908
and into many signatures fuzzy spot and
the malware

529
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:51,009
and d-backs typically picks up because I
use an Android get its not going any

530
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:51,610
memory

531
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,009
based talking so it's really hard to get
the signature

532
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:59,429
so you can see that there is another all
about the riches from the truck body to

533
00:30:59,429 --> 00:30:59,850
mean

534
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:06,850
the UN it is downloading the content

535
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:13,440
and since we know that you would
performing it not as it is this was a

536
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,200
like %ah

537
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,770
it contracted back to this particular
domain and you get an idea that is in a

538
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,550
blackhole exploit back running away

539
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:26,740
give Sienna stacks and how it looks and
then gives you like getting a job like

540
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,450
splice

541
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,920
this fine

542
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,910
safe to say that is the one notification
being raised by the mallu aunty bytes

543
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:39,030
and if you go back and look at the
signature

544
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,309
it gives you an idea that dissident
Seabaugh

545
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:47,340
and which is actually as you spot decks
lie I mean it's not a new attack

546
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,950
but it's been or school attack but it's
been executed in a different manner

547
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:55,290
annis is still locks very fine

548
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,370
and next that culprit cordis

549
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,720
which is actually doing the things
because if you a similar scenario how

550
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,970
many users look at the source code even
I don't do

551
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:08,370
then i doing and processing and I have
like some pics to do and I don't care

552
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:08,850
for that

553
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:13,130
but this actually gives you an idea of
where else and now you know how to

554
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:19,540
drive-by download attack walks now wanna
talk about like mad here on the cloud

555
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:23,570
all we analyze this case study were then
we doing some research on malware and

556
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,990
came across with the fact that

557
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:30,760
and is all it ws cloud issues to call
and the XIII doubt bends to defense that

558
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,480
abusers and that been so you that like
sex stories repository I maybe you can

559
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,890
host a website over it

560
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:39,720
and we find that this kind of malware
maybe

561
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,150
the guy actually the dagger exploited I
got an excess

562
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,920
and the guy decker actually hosted at
this kind of malware onto the

563
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,640
and is on a wuss tens and

564
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,010
you know it's not that easy to actually
scan all the bands

565
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:57,770
a deal unless you use the Amazon a WCB
eyes and then build up our product

566
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,870
according to that they don't allow you
to do their

567
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:04,570
tight body scanning alright I'll be
scanning so but this actually the link

568
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:07,210
is actually picked from some other
matter win at anything because it was

569
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:10,400
downloading from that link and it came
us to us and it was very

570
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,920
interesting so when you don't know the
Madras backed

571
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,140
and when we did the unpacking it's
things like that

572
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,720
and then you will when we unpack it

573
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,860
and we got like it was like a package
which is actually downloading that

574
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,860
like eleven o'clock different side of
fights

575
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,010
and every single file is still again and

576
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,919
backed as the like you px backer and a

577
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:38,030
from this spot you can realize the fact
that

578
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,850
did like 10 different kinda mendacious
lives have been banded together and it's

579
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,130
getting onto your system

580
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:48,470
I mean come on it's not gonna so no
protection mechanism can support this I

581
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,179
mean if it's got installed on your
system you have to reinstall your system

582
00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:56,140
but on Dylan time you do that

583
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:02,610
your system your information is not
yours and often looks we found that

584
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:07,270
that's how it is and again scanning them
out there just wanna give a quick check

585
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,580
and harassing you

586
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,168
five degrees 10 alert

587
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:16,290
about that is suspicious and a it is
expanding infections

588
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,389
so I did agree to the Amazon data move
date

589
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:23,580
and after that we haven't got any
instances a siren now there but this

590
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,739
actually gives you an idea

591
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:29,179
even the cloud technology are the cloud
infrastructure is not on touched by

592
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:33,750
this kind of malware and a

593
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:38,090
let's talk about now what is Ben's this
is not a name that actually being

594
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,520
harnessed from like militias Edward
easements

595
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,020
and i've seen that this thing is being
used because I've been offered

596
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:50,040
sometimes to do that far as some tight
body business provider where they want

597
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,899
like jack a hand with these names from
some other

598
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:57,830
companies but that was like an authentic
kind of thing and that is not legitimate

599
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:02,279
and but I'm sane I'm just discussing the
spot because

600
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:08,520
the business difficult like i say like
difference at all businesses at doing it

601
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,310
because they want a hex on their
products they want a hex on their web

602
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:11,840
sites

603
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:17,100
so they had design some sort of Molly
she s plugins that installed in your

604
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,990
browser and hijacked all the tax and the
places at that company website acts

605
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,190
and that that is working and

606
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,090
but consider this an hour there was an
update from like I'm rice blog at the

607
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,560
helicopter very good graphic for this
one

608
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,330
but if you wanna read them out is that
paper is being every label on the sly

609
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,670
sure that we ordered year

610
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:41,250
and that actually gives an idea se fue
down the hall apps

611
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:45,530
123 456 like seven different hops

612
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:50,740
the mod request sooo to tell them out is
downloaded into your system

613
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,270
and there is a publisher that is at
woodys advertiser and then there's an ad

614
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,890
network redirect their exploits Iran

615
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:01,359
things like that but they said these
kinda things like Malisha said woody's

616
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:01,799
nice

617
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,070
arced becoming the popular social are
downloading malware

618
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:08,710
typically the box and it's easy because
it damn see you a lot i mean you when I

619
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,370
get this gift click on it

620
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,830
and that courts you know take your
browser to some routes but you don't

621
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,290
know

622
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,880
but this walks be fine

623
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,370
the of course Hulk and I you know

624
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:25,009
the stock will not be completed by one
talk about like social network

625
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,820
exploitation

626
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,440
so our ongoing research is going over it
and it'll be completed within a

627
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,109
like next couple of months their ratio
eg exactly the complete model how the

628
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:39,140
social networks are being expired it's
not about difficulty in opening up a URL

629
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,350
things like that but how does use the
land route case actually hawks and you

630
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:47,750
the that chat panels like Twitter or
Facebook and then inject masses

631
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:52,830
in that but game game us to surprise
then we apply some other cases like

632
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,359
qualities that analyze

633
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:58,230
issues in that pic jacking and the like
checking at the same time

634
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:03,060
and then injecting a malicious lengths
on the your facebook profiles

635
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,509
it looks very bad and is very I was sale
I guess wat dangers from that

636
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,720
perspective

637
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,109
again is this exploiting the trust
boundary s take a look

638
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:19,069
at this attack

639
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,359
the only thing that uric what is the
fury remember like also

640
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:25,359
best lodging you have to be in a
sanctions typically means that you have

641
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,220
to login into the Facebook account

642
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:34,060
laissez does the prof I and

643
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,529
of the user who is actually listing is
for five tries and masses

644
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:41,990
some other users and is the malicious
that bees like I open and other web page

645
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:45,680
and I wanna suck that back page enough s
malicious

646
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,990
so if you remember if you look at the
house scourge sit there

647
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,430
you see that as the like button and you
can make it transparent

648
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:57,129
and i actually treat a bit of court
which I actually expected from on other

649
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,200
malicious

650
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,310
dummy rejected using this kind of
technique

651
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:05,529
and I retested and it was pretty good so
this is the code they are actually using

652
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,070
sending

653
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,410
it should give you best greedy

654
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:15,160
and it means if you consider the whole
screen bit tender land

655
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:21,569
you click anterior less act lik dat

656
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:25,510
safe in see there is a POST request that
is being issued on to the Facebook

657
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,000
content delivery network

658
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,740
and a salsa 200 OK means is a cepted

659
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,420
and I go back and then i refresh my page

660
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,640
and it gives you that like link

661
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,049
right should be malicious has to be
malicious

662
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:48,760
and menu click on that link you will be
redirected somewhere on this like what

663
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,080
up

664
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,790
beautiful song by this same here

665
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:57,140
so what the attacker day like so this
was like to be you see I posted for

666
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,960
showing that how it carried active
militias to me

667
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,339
so this Windows Media Player 5 has a
back door n8

668
00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:06,960
rejection dollar-some out there for you
menso even if you look at the source

669
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,410
code

670
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,859
ideal unless you want disassemble this
WMB 5

671
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:16,980
you won't be able to get them out here
unless you do the behavioral analysis

672
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,589
so that is the concept behind social
network exploitation a small

673
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:25,520
be you see that gives you an idea that
are still getting exploited

674
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,580
and I think it is a a pretty good at
that

675
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,830
in spreading malware

676
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:35,150
so what to talk about now the
present-day Bauknecht and one of the

677
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,720
most

678
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,510
appropriate technique they are using and
how they act

679
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,980
came across a different set of
techniques and they are you the stick to

680
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,990
that technique

681
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,280
messy it comes with the man in the
browser

682
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,070
I mean see if you remember we are
talking about that man in the middle

683
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,990
which actually compromising 22 n Pines

684
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,589
on having an ass action going on and
then you know acting out tight body

685
00:39:59,589 --> 00:40:03,480
between that and then compromise on that
network channel between two endpoints

686
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,500
but what happened man in the browser
it's like

687
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,890
okay I want to compromise your
communication channel

688
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,150
in the browser that works that would
actually

689
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:17,500
that and mike Beebe age Indus

690
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,500
typically an example %uh views and would
kick it is actually a system

691
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,910
but as you know in a shoes that'll and
you can cook

692
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:29,140
right there's that I can get a mani
techniques you can do that is stocks

693
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,560
would like for example

694
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,670
cooking you can do it but like important
dress table looking

695
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,660
you can do it like in that book in which
case all this the leg one of the most

696
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,580
sophisticated attack techniques
valiantly meant to deter and the

697
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,470
trampoline functions

698
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:45,970
and do the jump in the first five fights
this simple thing then there's the DLL

699
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,410
injection base you can

700
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:51,299
difficulty in injected be allowed in the
registry entry that is an an incall eyes

701
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,120
like happened at the other

702
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,740
you can do the second does hockey XE can
do that create remote add

703
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:02,030
if I remember one wall is like a PCB's
image Coxs malware

704
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:07,320
did many ways to perform hooking

705
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,880
you to some you got it so you can detect
some other cooking techniques very

706
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,580
easily

707
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,230
but like-for-like mami beast like in
line hooking it's really hard to detect

708
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:20,560
to do factor as as authentication things
like that SSL implementation is not

709
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,100
going to protect your games from these
kind of attacks

710
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,380
because it's inside your system and
again they're going to do something

711
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,060
really no previous

712
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:34,850
typically came to exist but the
existence of cogeneration bach next

713
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,420
why I used to call it %uh generation
because the expired online banking

714
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:41,450
motivation is to exploit online banking

715
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:45,530
and they're really harness the power of
SCTP communication channel

716
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:49,370
like http protocols and get both
requests get the idea

717
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,870
and get the information then act
according to a five generation bought

718
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:56,339
excuse I actually be spared a call
second-generation I think you speed to

719
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:56,900
be

720
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,700
and they of course there are hybrid
which can use anything

721
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,700
are the street but really get

722
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,560
this attack is to really really good

723
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,359
so what did i mean for the help so the
extracted this technique

724
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,600
which you used to call it that bad
checks

725
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,310
it's a similar to like a cross-site
scripting but in a cross-site scripting

726
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,190
you are not on a

727
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:22,589
on that use a machine you're on a tight
body domain send up a URL

728
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:26,270
in a trigger step to reject you download
something from the tight body to me

729
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:30,720
but in this particular case the mouth is
in your system the bodies inside your

730
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,010
system

731
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,980
saw whatever you sent a request to
Facebook dot com and your supp responses

732
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,400
coming back

733
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,800
in that case they have both a scenario

734
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,190
is difficult if I call it like that
binge extorting XT which has an impact

735
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,930
wrench which has an hour rules defined
in it

736
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,779
they say that if that isn't a facebook
dot com is being you know

737
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,100
added message being sent to Facebook dot
com by the user

738
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,480
whenever the responses coming back
inject a particular

739
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,540
inputbox or inject a particular
JavaScript before the stack

740
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,580
before that attack reject me though

741
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,609
very very I think artistic technique

742
00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:12,870
based on static route sex and this
actually gives you an idea here

743
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:17,279
that how it is done so this is deserve a
lot about binge actual

744
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,450
that we expected from a malicious so

745
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:25,089
just call infected machine and they have
an abandoned exciting XE 5

746
00:43:25,089 --> 00:43:28,700
and that two bodies actually reading
this could this kind of court and

747
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:33,050
injecting into the extra TP responses

748
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:36,550
and other side of Route 60 if you
remember I've seen like some other

749
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,520
protections that are implemented by the
Citibank

750
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,780
last year has been some bloody through
lab injects because they got like

751
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,839
day some other lab injects every
analyzed the actually build up their own

752
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,330
cookie

753
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:52,720
and then do the things do you know
really bomb

754
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,390
compromise the session but this looks
very fine

755
00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:00,170
and if you read more about this in a
blog entry that people still backed

756
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,720
other research in upcoming researches

757
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,420
going to bed some defend McCann like
defensive McCann -ism do

758
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:12,260
protecting bad checks and this
screenshot gives you an idea

759
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,380
there how it looks is a simple example
you get like

760
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,410
inject this idiot said there's like
three different accent you are I

761
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:23,160
you in a sec the URL again said to me it
is a GP

762
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,850
rejected gifts and I they select get to
question the POST request

763
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:30,529
doctor before got off to her and got
banned

764
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:34,420
that actually gives you an idea in which
bottled up that page 1 inject your

765
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,130
script

766
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,810
to look at as I in line so that it onto

767
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:43,060
impact the CSS layout of the back page
and that how it looks unsightly if you

768
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,650
look in on the right side

769
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,940
in the title bar injectors ear

770
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:53,580
because it injects into cited by and you
can do many things you can inject a

771
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,630
chalice caps do the automatic transfers

772
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:00,430
but that is really complex because the
year attacker has to come up with a

773
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:02,690
solid rules to do that

774
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:07,089
and it is very specific domains because
it might be possible Exchange Bank to

775
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:10,390
achieve bank is not using the same
direction at the Citibank

776
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:14,009
so it has to be about site-specific

777
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:18,770
and other 1i want to talk about his
about-face and a I don't %uh go deeper

778
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:21,040
into the DNS Changer malware

779
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,480
but the this is the affix a similar
technique based on da

780
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,150
looking and a came from the spy I

781
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:34,250
and inspired they had a plugin
architecture a plugin kinda framework

782
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,140
which actually implemented this thing

783
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,900
see if you can open a Facebook dot com
in 10 I'll

784
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,020
going to open you are different kinda to
me

785
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,480
and different parameters that define and
dismay because either the static para

786
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,140
meterse

787
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,740
attacker defined the bought reduce para
meterse

788
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:55,859
and then performed the freaks and how it
looks like to see

789
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:58,990
so these are the ball back functions
expire uses

790
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:02,890
to perform the that fix and

791
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:06,529
yeah you get an extra deep a response
and maybe they'll use it is trying to

792
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:07,859
send a follow request

793
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:10,980
do that %uh body domain I want to open
this URL

794
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:16,220
this is OK don't worry so got a call at
this call back and large and a

795
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:20,970
Wendys endless and executed you will see
something like this

796
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,010
and is in a bank of America your browser
show this legitimate

797
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:28,569
and it's an SSL I think notification for
like a proper certification saw

798
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:31,900
and that's all you get an ID on the
Internet Explorer 8 might

799
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,930
not having that gets a salon or
something like that but

800
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:38,190
it's a different page that gets
displayed and

801
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:42,380
in bad fakes it actually many place the
DNS entries

802
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:46,510
to some extent but also manipulate the
CSS layout on the back page

803
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:52,290
and then putting something as over it
base a real-time example

804
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,740
in the last thing that I wanna talk
about it like fun grabbing which I just

805
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,290
showing you a bit of our leading

806
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:01,790
life rocks is but %ah are beaching the
demonstration on a chase bank

807
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:06,069
and if you go in our days and open up
the cheese bank dot com

808
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:09,180
on the left hand side below the

809
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:13,230
shoes any manner possible you will see
that too check for the widest alerts and

810
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,280
things like that

811
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,330
and if you going to their fraud column
in your DC

812
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:20,509
the talk about dawn what your
information

813
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:25,330
and not malicious pop-up which is been
generated on the infected machine

814
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:29,120
and that pop up is because of that
injects that we have discussed are you

815
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:34,080
and exile sexually explicit generous
ambitious pop up and ask if I give me

816
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,759
your SSN number accountants are things
like that

817
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,030
but do go and check on cheese dot com
and is still there

818
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:46,109
and this technique this technique is an
icy like a net loss meant

819
00:47:46,109 --> 00:47:49,259
in like got key logging technique

820
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,960
what happened in Keelung like simply
okay just you name the man to fall back

821
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,220
and learn whatever they have in the
stands up and not WM underscored the

822
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,839
star messages

823
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,720
ok it and and you know but that a log
file into it

824
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,690
but with the attack us realize that Anna
did actually

825
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:09,260
you know getting a lot of garbage Datta
which they don't want

826
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,920
the only one a specifc post requests the
dot which is being

827
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,260
in the input forms because if you go
lands such a sum undergone farms

828
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:20,970
and things like that you will see that
it depends upon all sophisticated

829
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:24,339
logs are hand then how you get and dad

830
00:48:24,339 --> 00:48:28,839
the buyer be applauding to that and
that's the thing is and it's been a

831
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:32,589
I seem like many it would be spent on
the internet on farms

832
00:48:32,589 --> 00:48:36,620
but discuss have fun grabbing like
initially implemented by Chuckie votes

833
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:41,730
and your full those things on election
keyboard and a request actually being

834
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:46,710
saying this but you may send you some a
dick the washer keyboard and up to the

835
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:50,190
mechanics and they have implemented
simply sends the form request

836
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:53,510
and in both cases you won't get a key
lock data because you have not pressed

837
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,810
anything on your keyboard and a window
signs up

838
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:59,210
like does messages yet it's not like
that

839
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:05,420
is about based so the decker came across
a good why not to exploit this technique

840
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,930
so all they do like this still
implementing like a browser-based

841
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:09,040
talking

842
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,060
and in this particular thing if they
like the

843
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:16,359
in previous times that a sample said we
analyzed by doing DLL injection but now

844
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:17,779
the times the I

845
00:49:17,779 --> 00:49:22,500
doing it on in line hooking which makes
us really good

846
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,200
and if UCLA gives inject be alone it
performs in line looking

847
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,290
and it pokes be underscore right
function in the Mozilla and SPR forgot

848
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:33,830
the library and a secure 22 message

849
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:37,609
in Internet Explorer I think this
company to DL a library for and get

850
00:49:37,609 --> 00:49:38,750
message

851
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:41,750
and other thing is like they can also
hook into the night not be allowed which

852
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:43,670
ends up like all the HTTP

853
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:47,750
Navi sequester the more domain

854
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:51,430
texting their sidewalks so the idea is
like value try to fool

855
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:54,839
for something in the femmes login phone
sending in your summitted

856
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:59,650
bought gonna come up it Hoke said sense
into the command-and-control server

857
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:03,569
and your request still to relate back to
the

858
00:50:03,569 --> 00:50:06,859
like legitimate me and

859
00:50:06,859 --> 00:50:11,589
see how this

860
00:50:11,589 --> 00:50:15,210
so this this is a demonstration show you
how to i Sport walks

861
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:19,990
and is a real-time de Mon we analyze
service the binary get an idea how it

862
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,010
works

863
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:24,630
and if you get here so what I'm doing
like I have a sample

864
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:28,370
I'm executing it on my and later

865
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,380
here

866
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,650
typically a washing machine that we used
to perform analysis

867
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,970
that it gives you an idea that is in a
simple execute able

868
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:44,330
so then I executed

869
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:48,670
it makes for a bit

870
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:52,200
and then a diff trash is it it man sorry

871
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,500
said because most of these bought seven
I like a fat destructible called like

872
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,589
they can simply

873
00:50:57,589 --> 00:51:00,960
inject and I'm a leash a bitch say like
simply inject %ah

874
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,870
are batch file in it okay delete dropper

875
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:07,990
menu install the pot and

876
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:11,180
now I'm logging into the
command-and-control server on the ice

877
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:15,650
part

878
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:20,120
so you see that

879
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:24,020
I get all the list so the boss there are
in fact it

880
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:27,190
and landing this link just try to show
that our system is in fact in

881
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:31,490
when I get an open like my IP address is
this

882
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:34,690
and Nickelback so you see that

883
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:39,049
that IP addresses their and it means
that our system is infected that that

884
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:42,120
part

885
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:49,120
so we have been found it's in fact it
here less less open a chase bank website

886
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:56,180
yes if you go and now look at the Chase
Bank so below that box you can see there

887
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:00,859
elect notification some not giving a
legitimate potentials of course I

888
00:52:00,859 --> 00:52:05,200
months balls to do that but and sending
the request year

889
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:12,200
I'm also hoping a legitimate Facebook
here

890
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:19,049
just try to show that it blocks sector
lost every website you opening your

891
00:52:19,049 --> 00:52:24,780
browser on the infected machine side in
Sendai legitimate

892
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,859
you know for NGOs but the request is
sent that's why you getting this idea

893
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:34,569
the response back from the side where
that got it now let's get back to the

894
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:35,920
command-and-control server

895
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,440
so if you see at the bottom you get the
request

896
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,030
and SR looks like bought it. is this

897
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:48,280
botnet is ice nine been awash in is
being there at everything

898
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:54,180
and that's a your pussy Chris so

899
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:58,799
your account is here right and typically
if you look at the use it in before this

900
00:52:58,799 --> 00:52:59,440
is a like a

901
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,010
key law got up but that key loggers on
the restricted to the input farms here

902
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:08,579
it's not without whole system data and
this log is

903
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:13,069
optimized is a sophisticated logjam in
and its gonna get a more value

904
00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:16,359
and undergone community you end up but
must is going to sell it

905
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:23,359
yet so typically with the Facebook we go
back

906
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:29,089
and men

907
00:53:29,089 --> 00:53:36,089
really fresh in our commanding control
panel began the Facebook too

908
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:43,740
yes we get the poster crest and all the
data that we won't so I'm

909
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:48,490
considering this fun I don't want to in
fact and do some like different kind of

910
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,720
attacks if I can simply in fact your
system

911
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,940
but this kind of malware and

912
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,470
nests essentially guess I spot which is
an hour

913
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:01,829
I was selected loss man in the some
others you scored

914
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:07,769
and is another information stating fact
is like I got grabber certificate grab

915
00:54:07,769 --> 00:54:09,240
their socks back max

916
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,509
that can hijack a infecting messengers
and things like that but there's a lot

917
00:54:13,509 --> 00:54:14,890
of study on that too

918
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:18,480
which I gonna put in this talk but

919
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,670
the overall concept that I had discussed
in that I've been used heavily

920
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:25,829
and if you look at these kind of
practice tix are being

921
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:29,039
blighted by all different box nowadays

922
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:36,039
and you're open to question

923
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:50,450
yes or if you remember lakkha

924
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:55,099
I'm not sure but there's a like the like
four months back there was a case study

925
00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:56,690
on Beale endured on he bought

926
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:59,829
which is actually impacted the Mac OS X

927
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:03,349
in actually ex-lax the flash liability
bill I'm not saying it's expired a

928
00:55:03,349 --> 00:55:04,309
wonderful 18

929
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:09,339
suffice South but he exploited the
liability in Flash plugin of some stuff

930
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:10,269
I compliment

931
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:13,680
and I did follow the same attack back
trying to install da

932
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:18,140
farm grabber the bought that actually
does the perform grab around the Safari

933
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:21,989
on the Mac machines and it looks pretty
fine

934
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:25,999
though there is %uh affect earth are the
numbers up 30% less

935
00:55:25,999 --> 00:55:29,299
for conceding the Mac base malware by
actor

936
00:55:29,299 --> 00:55:33,109
yeah we have seen that but maybe in the
later time we'll see much more

937
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:36,319
the I hardly find it

938
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:39,499
I may be back door side there but to

939
00:55:39,499 --> 00:55:46,499
that we love in dose yeah the I think it

940
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:59,130
CA a gushing on a big traffic the most
of like if I remember like there's a

941
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:02,259
fund's call at like I'm just talking
about from business perspective is that

942
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:03,089
damn balla

943
00:56:03,089 --> 00:56:07,219
have fun bitch actually money does all
your DNS base traffic

944
00:56:07,219 --> 00:56:10,729
and try to find employment the
blacklisting

945
00:56:10,729 --> 00:56:14,809
techniques and how to interpret the DNS
flexing at the back end and that

946
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:16,420
actually gives them an idea that

947
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,719
better they want a flag that domain
because if you do that

948
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:23,079
you won't be getting any other side a
matter for example

949
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:27,239
reverse honeypots do that i mean they
implement a blacklist acne a blacklist

950
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:30,519
and this like what I was at its best
that is coming out or any command and

951
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:33,420
control server present outside the
domain of communicating

952
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:37,729
back to your system they won't allow
that but disassembling but is like more

953
00:56:37,729 --> 00:56:39,029
of like I think like a

954
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:43,479
jus a spastic like the expire date you
this ignorance and things like that

955
00:56:43,479 --> 00:56:47,259
but if that is a I say sell of asymmetry

956
00:56:47,259 --> 00:56:51,519
I mean it's a never-ending game but
weathervanes if we can delay a

957
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:54,809
execution a botnet week months we can
still see a lot of money

958
00:56:54,809 --> 00:57:01,369
and that's what the odd is all about yep

959
00:57:01,369 --> 00:57:01,999
thanks
