1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,679
for probably better part iv: up a decade

project to document the history of

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:15,990
intriguing

amazing journey in documenting this book

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,000
like times and interviews in for your
request send it was a

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,180
I he'll say it like it was like this
journey down the rabbit hole for little

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,730
twisty turny mazes

12
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,590
its its it was it was a journey so Phil

take away thanks very much bernie

14
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,140
on by the way I just have to I have to
be clear

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,110
it was not a decade it's five years my
wife is in the audience if she hears I

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,450
was actually secretly working on this
for a decade I'm

17
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,570
a Deadman understood ray detector is
only two years really

18
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,110
until his money bernie asked me we're
talking about

19
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,909
you know come give a talk on phone
freaking that's why I'd love to but you

20
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:21,950
know my publishers gonna get really mad
at me if I give away everything in the

21
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,330
book

22
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,619
any said will toast everything that's
not in the book because the very best

23
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,610
stories start with

24
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,960
don't put this in your book you know so
so that's what I do today and so that's

25
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,720
why we have this LA Noire theme

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,000
fun free confidential I'm the

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,210
at so here's here's where I like to talk
about today

28
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,130
on I'm first they have to disclose I
have developed

29
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,990
from reading all these a FOIA request an
FBI files I developed a certain

30
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,430
love some would call it a fetish for all

31
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,939
FBI memos and styles and things

32
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:58,700
and so you know you're gonna see this
kinda throughout because it's kinda

33
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,869
I spend much of my life seemingly living
in the nineteen sixties nineteen

34
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:04,509
seventies reading old members were
things were sent by tell it I

35
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:07,960
but so what I'd like to do today and
tell you a little bit I'm just for those

36
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,060
of you who are not present for the
nineteen sixties 1970 tell you a little

37
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,239
bit on the background about

38
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,319
phone freaking I don't like to describe
some my freedom of information act

39
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,400
travails and experiences and and fun
things and then I'm

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,520
gonna go off the record and tell you
other stuff is not in the book

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,390
and then conclude with a few lessons
learned the lessons learned are not just

42
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,970
for those of you reading history books

43
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,349
which I can tell you is not particularly
lucrative a good way to spend your time

44
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,750
but as for any big creative project and

45
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,750
but especially anyone that has kinda any
sort of historical bent to it

46
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,129
and for any of you who may be worried

47
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:44,940
I'm just want to stress that all
information contained herein is

48
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,180
unclassified

49
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,379
at least according to FBI
declassification guy 603 24

50
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,140
who sounds like you should be working
for the department hope when security

51
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,160
with a name like that

52
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,000
so here's the background briefing on
phone freaking

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,030
and remember my FBI memo fetish this

54
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,800
this is this is beautiful so when the
FBI send you something under the Freedom

55
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,849
of Information Act

56
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:10,640
they scan it in in a often now senate
you electronically

57
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,620
and their scanner has this amazing way
of taking all black and white photograph

58
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,569
making them look just so cool

59
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:22,340
but admire this for just a moment and
natural world were a telephone receiver

60
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,409
ends up with an FBI evidence tag on it

61
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:28,629
right I mean ok how does that happen

62
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:32,470
and it turned out there there are
several reasons how that happens and

63
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,190
the first one starts here now if you are
a normal person

64
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:41,260
you look at that meeting well you know
it's not a rotary phone whatever it's a

65
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,899
fun

66
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,629
right is not an interesting it's not
something you spend any time thinking

67
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:45,359
about

68
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,860
it is in the words a a fun free Kevin
doorbell it is not something that is

69
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,739
interesting enough to be interested in

70
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,080
at all if you're in this audience I
posit the you're not a normal person

71
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:02,080
cap and and so to me this represents not
a black rotary phone

72
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,099
but it represents curiosity personified
because if you have

73
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:10,540
a certain mental defect like many of us
do you look at something like that and

74
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,280
you say

75
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,720
while I wonder how that works I

76
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,639
I wonder where it goes to and wonder
what happens if you take it apart I

77
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,910
wonder if what happened if you use in
ways that was not intended to be used

78
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,669
I wonder what happens if you dial
numbers that are not in the phone book

79
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:27,840
I wonder what happens if you play with
where do those wires go

80
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,600
how does that all work in addition

81
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,580
if that's not enough they they made it
more tantalizing because in the old days

82
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:42,430
if you place the call a long distance
call you hear something like this

83
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:48,870
can we maybe up the volume on that just
a smidge with

84
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,009
K let me assure

85
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:55,199
hand how many people but long distance
calling heard something like that

86
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,600
right okay so a chunk a view at that you
have a certain age

87
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,090
on but you know it you you place the
call and again

88
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,030
you know in words a bill Murray there's
something wrong with us something very

89
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,360
very wrong with us

90
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,210
you hear those times me think what are
those what with its talking to some

91
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,419
things are these tones with what are
they how does it work

92
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,159
and still you get this curiosity and so
starting around

93
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,669
in the nineteen fifties nineteen sixties
you start to get people

94
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:25,120
who want to play with the funder just a
curious about the one understand how it

95
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,389
works I want to take it apart they want
it they wanna hack with that

96
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,300
now there that's the one thing that
causes a ever tell congress even have an

97
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,880
FBI evidence tag on it

98
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,860
is curiosity there's another thing which
plays into this

99
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,139
which is economics if you go back to

100
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:46,470
the 1989 is when the fun starts you
don't have telephone with tiles you just

101
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,530
have to thank you pick up the phone and
the operator says number please

102
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,020
the operator initially was teenage boys
but they figured out pretty quickly that

103
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,020
didn't work

104
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,060
so on so they replace them with the

105
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,259
with female operators who were more
pleasant but

106
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,560
you initially its number please but then
eventually have fun but I'll sleep now

107
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,930
he's talking to long-distance

108
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,970
even by the nineteen fifties 1960 is

109
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,720
you know seventy percent long distance
calls were still place through an

110
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,380
operator

111
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,569
on accord more I you knowing you you
know she's selects a jacket maybe she

112
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:16,160
has little

113
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,270
keypad which was not a range in a three
by four thing was to

114
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,889
to buy five for for sending MF towns to
machines

115
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:26,630
but wait someone like this places your
calls

116
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:31,690
now via that's it the FBI no the phone
companies are getting confused sometimes

117
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,919
the the phone company I you Chris Martin
to people

118
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,710
and they can see the handwriting on the
wall telephone service is becoming more

119
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,000
and more popular

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,340
and they look at something like this in
in from the 1932 about the 1950s 1960s

121
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,009
they employ about 100,000 telephone
operators

122
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,130
now think about that that's a pretty
staggering number hundred thousand

123
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,759
people

124
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:56,240
and telephone operators initially they
started off doing local calls but then

125
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,000
as local calls get automated

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,550
they switch over to too long distance
now

127
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,740
that's fine for a hundred thousand
people but even by the nineteen fifties

128
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,190
it figured out the guy here at the
current rate of growth by nineteen

129
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,969
65 1970 we're gonna need a million
telephone operators

130
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,020
there are two problems with that from
number one is we can't afford it paying

131
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,870
a million people just gonna bankrupt us

132
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,380
prime number two is it turns out they're
simply had that many women in the

133
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,400
workforce right

134
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,319
I mean imagine that your like the
national HR Director AT&T and you got

135
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,380
your envelope out in the restaurant you
doing the back thing they have a bye

136
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:27,949
million

137
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:31,560
the that doesn't work but there's can't
do it

138
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,330
so the answer is automation

139
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,979
so this is a photo from the AT&T
archives: have what's called a 480

140
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:41,469
crossbar for a

141
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,539
480 machine at its take a look at that
for just the second get the scale is not

142
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:47,469
a great photo

143
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,060
but that'd that is a man standing there
notice that the machine is much much

144
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,930
larger

145
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,259
then realized that this is only a
portion of the machine

146
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,360
this machine which was beyond we're not
talking transistors like this plan was

147
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,240
first built in 1943

148
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,229
we're talking electromechanical switches
were talking really is we're talking

149
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:05,590
back into

150
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,979
this thing took up the better part of a
city block

151
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:12,360
K AT&T ended up installing hundreds of
these things

152
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,460
around the country in this was the magic
switching machine that could figure out

153
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,330
how to automatically routed call

154
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,949
from point A to point B it could talk to
others which machines it was the thing

155
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:24,080
which is going to make long distance
operators obsolete

156
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,500
now II don't just remain stunned by that
is that is such a tall order right

157
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,059
imagine building machine that knows how
to route a call from point A to point B

158
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,029
except you don't have a computer and in
fact the transistor hadn't been invented

159
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,769
yet

160
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:40,529
right this is a tall order and yet AT&T
actually did this

161
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:44,820
so you got these machines but now it in
the old days we offer is one communicate

162
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,620
with one another and plug into the jack
in a

163
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,850
you know dial the next city closer to
your destination and

164
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,330
you know the operator there would say
you know Denver inward and use a denver

165
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,940
this issue cago en you to place a call
to this number and it would

166
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,120
the cold move downfield re manually with
operators talking to one another

167
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,070
now with the machines the machines have
to talk to each other how they gonna do

168
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:03,570
that

169
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,920
well it turns out they're gonna do it by
tons and so the entire network was

170
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,360
controlled by towns out how the machines
communicated there is a 2600 herds town

171
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,860
a which control whether a phone call was
on or off ok

172
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,180
and then there are these MF towns kinda
like touchdowns though the enough times

173
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,850
that we heard before the ones that were
so curious about

174
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,880
and that's what allows the machines to
communicate the only problem is that the

175
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,350
machines can hear that can make in here
these towns then so can

176
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,740
clever human beings and so it's not very
long before

177
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,290
you have people making these boxes I'm
the one on the left was a was so-called

178
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,459
single frequency box May 1961

179
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:42,839
by a college student up in the pacific
northwest and

180
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,560
is you rotated that that dial there it
would just make bbbbb

181
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,839
beep beep you know whatever number you
dialed and that was bill signaling

182
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,330
system

183
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,720
later they had a more sophisticated
signalling systems to the one on the

184
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,860
right is a multi-frequency box which
made those

185
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,490
those quick little towns that we heard
before I'm like touchdowns but different

186
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,480
frequencies

187
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,029
so with this you could make a free phone
call

188
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:08,500
um thank you register 2600 heard some
place that somebody just be

189
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,370
I paraded I'm with this you can make a
free phone call

190
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,910
but that's actually almost not the point
because for the for the kids in this

191
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,060
generation for the nineteen sixties

192
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,790
yeah okay sure a and talk to so many of
these countries and they would tell me

193
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,910
were fifteen-year-old 16-year-old
17-year-old kid

194
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,050
we don't have anybody to call right

195
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,769
we don't know anybody the only thing we
want to do is we want to call

196
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:35,540
you know we want to come non-working
test numbers wanna see how close we can

197
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,399
get to the North Pole we wanna you know

198
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:40,990
which ones you're gonna reports were
just curious right

199
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,980
so arm that you know that's really the
the

200
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,600
that's the impetus for this if you are a
teenage phone freak in the 1960s 1970s

201
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,260
you wanna play with the network not to
say that you never made free calls you

202
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,550
want to talk to your friends of course
once you discover them

203
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,690
but that's the main reason now there's
another

204
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,730
said of people who like this on and
their people like this

205
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,829
this is a bookmaker in the nineteen
forties and it turns out

206
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:09,800
pre-internet 1940 is if you wanted to
keep in touch with your customers and if

207
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,950
you want to know

208
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:15,079
you know what these betting line was
from Las Vegas and Atlantic City on a

209
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:15,820
sporting event

210
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,910
you were constantly on the phone as as
evidenced buy this photo here

211
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,519
I'm in that was to problem for you if
your book make a prime number one is

212
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,540
really expensive because AT&T is rates
for expensive back in the day for

213
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,610
long-distance

214
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,980
from number two is that the pesky FBI

215
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,050
is constantly looking in your toll
records we just had that talk by

216
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,670
by the EFSF attorney to the the FBI had
to get well we can't necessarily wiretap

217
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,599
these guys it was

218
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,120
at the time it wasn't necessarily legal
but we can certainly subpoena their toll

219
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,570
records and figure out

220
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,800
who this guy calls in builder network
map

221
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,180
until the what organized crime in
bookmakers were particularly interested

222
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,680
in using blue boxes in black boxes

223
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,680
to defeat the telephone companies
carefully designed billing system

224
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,050
so that there were any records anymore
the phone calls that they had made

225
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,820
so you got to different users group here
if you will right you have the phone for

226
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,329
users ripping out the organized crime
Users Group

227
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:10,589
the Palm Pre started off arm you know as

228
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:15,529
people working alone in isolation but
around 1969 1970

229
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:19,709
they start to meet one another and is
kinda through a series a really

230
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:24,540
random kinda connections and so this is
this is John Draper Captain Crunch

231
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,769
one of the more notorious on freaks in
this era but there were others John

232
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:28,519
Brescia

233
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,050
AK joy bubbles the wind whistling phone
free a bill from New York

234
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,550
a whole bunch on there and they just
based on meeting each other through

235
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,760
anonymous lou brown circuits through
introduction from one another

236
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,569
and pretty soon you got by 1969 1970
that the whole

237
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,870
underground community that starting to
talk to each other and you know

238
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,959
as as many of them told me like this is
the greatest thing in the world because

239
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,750
up until now it's just been

240
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,139
me and the phone and whenever I talk to
somebody about it I got stupid phone

241
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,139
whatever who cares what done hobby

242
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:59,930
now I finally met somebody that that
actually guess it's not just somebody

243
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,430
but multiple people this is an amazing
thing if you're sixteen ok in your kinda

244
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,329
lonely and you have a

245
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:09,269
and an art hobby then ron rosenbaum
comes along

246
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:13,380
in 1971 and rights an Esquire magazine
article

247
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,950
about a consequence a little blue box
esquire that circulation 500,000 people

248
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,570
and this underground hobby just gets
blown out to the entire world right now

249
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,149
everybody knows about this

250
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:26,410
the article reads like fiction but if
you're a certain kind of a person say

251
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,040
you're a steve wozniak

252
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,339
and you read this you look at you like
this isn't fiction

253
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:34,959
this isn't taking this has got to be
real I've gotta figure this stuff out

254
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,430
I'm by the way this is a something it
never ceases to amaze me

255
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,540
any phone freak who learned about on
freedom from the esquire article can

256
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,490
describe the esquire article on page 116
which begins with a photo of a blue box

257
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,540
they can describe it to me in detail is
oh my god is great

258
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,199
really well written article is got this
fantastic boxes and plastic boxes got 13

259
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,180
buttons on a twelve

260
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:01,329
final in a bit none of them remember the
cover of the magazine

261
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:05,440
not not one

262
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,139
so the other thing that happens in 1971
is

263
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,750
the hippies get all this and so this is
the youth international party lines and

264
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,110
their first newsletter in San of you to
the youth international party

265
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,269
and unlike the phone hackers a

266
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:23,100
you know being interested in just
experimenting and playing with the

267
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,260
telephone network

268
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,459
the UPS had a great specific a political
purpose for this which is

269
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:31,800
this is the way to stick it to the man
in particular not just the phone company

270
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,740
who they didn't like

271
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,240
but the United States government why is
that well there is something called the

272
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,949
telephone excise tax

273
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:41,639
as the ten-percent attacks on long
distance phone calls

274
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,480
and that was used to pay a treat them
like you know billion billion-and-a-half

275
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,690
dollars in nineteen seventy or so

276
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,019
is significant money that's about 10
percent of the cost to Vietnam War

277
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:54,440
so the great news is if you can figure
out how to make free phone calls

278
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,959
not only you get free phone calls but
you're screwing the government in

279
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:57,579
preventing

280
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:00,329
you know the government for sending
people off to fight and die in southeast

281
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:02,089
asia what a great thing right

282
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:06,120
so you know this is the start kinda a
the cultural hijacking

283
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,810
what was this little geeky hobbyists
morning telephone network name that

284
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,600
people just wanna make free phone call
you that

285
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,029
the hippies were getting involved you
get all the stuff

286
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:23,290
now the next thing that comes out is in
1975

287
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,019
you find out that the phone company had
not been sitting idly by during this

288
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:26,940
time

289
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,320
they heard in 1961 that's when they
first discovered a blue box

290
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,889
and a in 1964 to 1970 they had built

291
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:38,300
a toll fraud surveillance network right
now they can use their normal billing

292
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,670
system because that's what the blue box
defeat so they don't a separate thing

293
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,139
is worth six machines deployed all over
this the citizen United States they

294
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:47,000
moved around from time to time

295
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,750
it randomly monitored phone calls
looking for evidence of fraud like

296
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,089
2600 hurts online when it shouldn't be
there

297
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,220
and when it found it it would take an
additional next at it would actually

298
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,720
tape record the call

299
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,720
onto reel to reel tape they randomly
monitored

300
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,230
and during that time 33 million phone
calls in tape-recorded and listen to

301
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,269
them by year 1.5 million

302
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:11,860
over them all to get an understanding up
how big is this problem are we totally

303
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,870
screwed her we only just a little bit
screwed

304
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,329
right because he you need you need
statistics like that if your gonna make

305
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:19,880
any sort of decision about maybe having
to spend a billion dollars to upgrade

306
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,350
your network to your to the fraud
problem

307
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:26,699
so that came out 1975 a in Saint Louis
post-dispatch happened

308
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:30,480
to get an expose on I'm skipping over a
whole bunch of history here

309
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,529
that is fun to give you the the
background on that

310
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:36,740
so that's fun freaking in a nutshell
during a San Juan heyday

311
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,240
um when I started writing this book in
2006 I was immediately contacted by

312
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,060
several modern day phone free she said

313
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,360
whatever you do do not tell people the
country king is dead

314
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,320
and so I hereby tell you from drinking
is not dead but that's the 1960 1970

315
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,440
version A

316
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,209
said I'd like to talk to you a little
bit about the Freedom of Information Act

317
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:57,130
but before I do I want to ogle this very
fine

318
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,360
FBI evidence photo and ever enter and

319
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,240
ever-ready energizer transistor or
vacuum to battery

320
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,069
this is not a small battery my friends
which is evidence

321
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,089
right so isn't that awesome

322
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,349
on so in the process

323
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:18,520
writing this book kinda relying heavily
on the freedom of information act in

324
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,699
addition to interviews

325
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:23,699
I filed over 400 freedom Information Act
request and I got about a hundred of

326
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,459
them were successful meeting at three
hundred

327
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,990
my got back basically go a boy a bother
us we don't have any records like that

328
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,809
I I spammed virtually every federal
agency I could think I have

329
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:38,080
you FBI Department justice national
security agency the CIA the Air Force

330
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,760
Navy the Army

331
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,700
I look the federal federal agency for
the management

332
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,250
noxious weeds I did not send anything
tonight is there really agency

333
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,780
I'm some other response about this once
I got back for maybe in three months

334
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,059
on in the case the National Security
Agency it took three years

335
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:58,610
to get a response back i'd I do not
recommend this and what you're working

336
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,880
on a five year PhD or five your book

337
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,090
under project need something next week
this is not gonna help you

338
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,480
I'm this is the the memo here not even
read it but just give you a sense of

339
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,320
what this is like

340
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,799
you get stuff back from the government
and they're allowed to

341
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,750
to redact pieces out and along the right
hand side in that memo you'll see the

342
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:23,750
zombies little codes

343
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,390
but the the codes described which parts
in the memoir blacked out into very

344
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,590
frequently you get

345
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,720
names that are blacked out under there's
an exemption called b6 rb7 see which has

346
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,080
your personal privacy

347
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,340
I spent a lot of time looking at I got
you

348
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,860
10,000 pages documents I spent studying
like this trying to figure out

349
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,809
well who then that blacked out space huh
that like that space looks like it's

350
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,070
four characters long

351
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,178
I know on frequent a poor character last
name maybe that a lot of time puzzling

352
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:54,570
over this and develop a number of
different techniques for

353
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,149
for getting more information for data
mining out of paper if you will

354
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,809
on one of which was if you request the
same file by multiple methods

355
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:07,250
I'm in May turn out that multiple people
at the FBI or whoever actually process

356
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,419
it and different people being human
beings react different things and then

357
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:14,840
you can lay the papers on top of each
other and seems to be what else is there

358
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,860
I'm the other thing I found and the

359
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,919
if a person is better for me said you
know it

360
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:24,160
you wanna be polite to people right and
I worked really hard

361
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,570
to not come off as a total nut job right
which in fact

362
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,918
I am on but but yes I would and spend
time talking

363
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,520
the FBI clerks who are processing these
things I would I would explain to them

364
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,629
that you know this wrongdoing is a very
legitimate historical thing

365
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,330
I tried to be very very nice to them and
I think that work

366
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,480
it got to the point where I mean taking
things a little bit far eastern saying

367
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,220
them holiday cards

368
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:55,220
on

369
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,559
this is a holiday card is sent to the
FBI and and the NSA in 2008

370
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:04,370
and am you know it may not have actually
got me any additional documents but it

371
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,140
did give me a couple good stories

372
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,200
one of which was I'm at one point I
requested some

373
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,650
some file having to do with the San
Francisco FBI office wiretapping

374
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,390
and the the FBI player person

375
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,620
basically sent me a letter saying no I
you know we can send that to you

376
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,760
and so I am calling and talking to on
the fun and I

377
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,780
and we we had a very nice chat and she
said well you know

378
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,379
when I wrote up the denial letter I took
the denial letter to my supervisor and

379
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,890
handed it to her to approve

380
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,809
and my supervisor took one look at it
said oh you're not gonna send mister

381
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,500
Lapsley this are you

382
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,620
and she said why I think I have to I
don't actually think he's entitled to

383
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,400
this information under fire

384
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,940
and she signed it handed it back to me
is that what you're not going to get a

385
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,500
Christmas card this year

386
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:52,299
a

387
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:56,870
so you catch more flies with honey maybe
I'm okay so some other things that

388
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:01,179
that I've got from boyer on you may have
seen them as before

389
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:04,429
a drivable joined rescue the wind
whistling phone freak

390
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,640
on he was arrested 19-7 the

391
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,630
one 31 I think in Memphis but it turns
up prior to that he had been

392
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,250
investigated by the FBI in 1969

393
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,460
and I you can't buy read all this but
but what's stunning about this is this

394
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,360
is a letter sent by the FBI after they
determined

395
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,880
that he might and they weren't even sure
that he had but he might have been

396
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,830
listening to

397
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,559
both the military autumn on phone system
breaking into it and also the White

398
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,139
House

399
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,530
a system and so what it says here

400
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,840
it this is actually a letter to the
Honorable John D erlich min counsel to

401
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,639
the president

402
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,090
from the FBI and you want the question
I'm trying to figure out what I wrote my

403
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:41,799
book is will

404
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:45,900
how im how seriously did the federal
government and the FBI take own freaking

405
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,570
right well

406
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,789
apparently seriously enough to send a
letter to president nixon saying hey we

407
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:53,770
think this blind guy who can whistle
broke into the white house phone system

408
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,629
but we're not really sure

409
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,820
on here's another one this is from

410
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,370
I am the director of the FBI clarence
kelly

411
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:07,720
and it is too mister John deed to but
he's the chairman of the board have 18

412
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,289
teens in 1976 and it was when

413
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:13,620
a several years before 1976 in the early
seventies

414
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,750
the Palm Pre said figured out in some
parts of the country you can use a blue

415
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,890
box to wiretap

416
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,250
phone calls and in 1975 a

417
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,070
John Draper a used his blue box to
wiretap the

418
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,330
FBI San Francisco field office and then
he bragged about it to somebody who is

419
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,010
an informant for the FBI

420
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:34,960
and that didn't end well for him I but
it

421
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,960
yes John are you here there john get my
hand

422
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,389
so but it you know it it generates this
letter

423
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,179
I'm much I'll see if I can I can read
and talked with Mike from the same time

424
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:57,039
I am advised hear me a lot I'm advised
that

425
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,860
information just adopting confirm
disclose the condition which permits any

426
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,000
knowledgeable person using a blue box to
intercept and monitor telephone

427
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,110
conversation

428
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,130
to and from the San Francisco FBI office
and other subscribers in that area

429
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,270
this is the most alarming situation

430
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:16,120
and I request the full cooperation in
your organization and its resources to

431
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,130
assess the possibility for similar
condition

432
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,929
elsewhere and take immediate corrective
action wherever they exist so

433
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:26,240
you know be a John you managed to piss
off the director the FBI network

434
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,240
on alright

435
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,120
then a.m. a this is another thing this
lever

436
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,400
formerly classified secret this is my 3
year and as a request

437
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,440
and sister insert if you know that the
NSA they've got the code breaking

438
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,929
portion of the house right which is
concerned with communications

439
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:52,460
intelligence breaking other people's
code and they've got the code making and

440
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,799
communications security COMSEC side to
the house

441
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,850
so it turned out in nineteen seventy sex
because

442
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,490
various things the phone freeze for up
to including up starting to break into

443
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,690
computers in the very early days and
also breaking the military autumn on

444
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,909
phone system and also wiretapping the
FBI

445
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:11,000
the and if a conflict people got
involved in this and so

446
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,080
on this is the Para members 1 I'm title

447
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,799
on Fri conveyed audubon and the others
title fun free from a computer networks

448
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:18,530
is written by

449
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,799
by the COMSEC eyes 10 lines I love out
on this certain element to the phone

450
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,799
free community

451
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:27,200
have expanded their activities to
include accessing computer systems

452
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,020
including drum roll please those systems
including those access by teletype

453
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,080
writers and cathode ray tubes

454
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,689
a one conference stated that he had
access the Advanced Research Projects

455
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,230
Agency ARPA network

456
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,470
once there he could access other
computers including the NSA

457
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:48,169
so on you know so just interesting to
see have how the government

458
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:51,179
you know dealt with this stuff and how
seriously they took it not the final

459
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:52,549
thing is when you're

460
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:56,168
going through ten thousand pages love
FBI documents being

461
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:59,770
you kiss a lot it hurts right there's an
awful lot of pages like yeah blah blah

462
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,179
blah

463
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:03,400
and because a lot of my stuff involved
organized crime

464
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,130
I spent a lot of time reading organized
crime file much which had nothing to do

465
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,100
with on freaking but occasionally you
get these things adjuster to make it

466
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,940
worthwhile

467
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,429
this I just remember putting profile and
then suddenly coming up on this

468
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:20,419
um this is in some random organized
crime guys file

469
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:23,820
and what I love about this in particular
is the fact that the woman's face

470
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,240
is blacked out with a b6 and b7 see in
the corner because a personal privacy

471
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,600
right the FBI take their job very
seriously though give me the photo just

472
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,380
not the face

473
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,720
so I'm so that that

474
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,900
that supreme Information Act so

475
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,340
now I'd like to to tell you a few of the
records stories

476
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:47,090
a again after we first ongoing FBI
evidence photo

477
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,340
I'm not really sure what that is in
russia is evidence out but something bad

478
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:50,820
no doubt

479
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,230
on I like your first introduce you to

480
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,610
a fellow named can harbor and can

481
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,929
was a longtime employee at the a

482
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:06,540
the a Bell System you work for both Bell
Pennsylvania and the laboratories he was

483
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,040
a the head at one point to the telephone
crime lab he worked in their special

484
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,350
Systems Group which did government
projects

485
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,409
I and he was

486
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:18,559
he was involved in all this stuff and he
was a tremendous resource to me

487
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,040
made many introductions a might be happy
is also a pack rat as you can see here

488
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,950
this is when he was in 2006 he was 80
years old unfortunately passed away from

489
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,380
cancer about a year later

490
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,090
I but you know proof have

491
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,600
just how helpful pakrats art historians
which is the theme which came up over

492
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,130
and over again during this book

493
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,240
just you know there's there's nothing
like actual copy is a

494
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,659
a papers or whatever from the day by the
way for those of you who are hand he

495
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:46,789
think he was a ham Katie seven KH

496
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:50,570
but the thing that he said to me don't
put this in your book but

497
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,120
anybody recognize this

498
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,179
I heard submarine

499
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:03,100
so back in the nineteen seventies

500
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,880
I the United States

501
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,030
a intercepted a bunch of soviet undersea
cables as a thing called Operation Ivy

502
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:11,649
bells

503
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:16,350
and if you're going to want help with
somebody who if you want help from

504
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,590
somebody building a

505
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,720
a undersea cable tapping system well you
turn to

506
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,470
Bell Labs and the government systems
group and so

507
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:29,440
US submarines place this thing on the
floor a

508
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,580
the ASEAN outsider just off because to
Russia

509
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,460
and was inducted cap probe self-powered
you know you frogmen get out on a

510
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,169
submarine and put it there and hook up
the cable

511
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:44,460
and eventually I the soviets found out
about this apparently produced a lot of

512
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,520
great intelligence press for several
years

513
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,240
and there's a book called blind man's
bluff which you should read it's really

514
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,210
fascinating

515
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,909
about the that the be so the submarine
espionage program

516
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:58,870
but this one up on display in a museum
in Moscow on the talk about the fact

517
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:59,480
that

518
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,540
it actually has a thumb in the eye to
the soviets because

519
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,649
once you open this thing up there's a
sign inside that says

520
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:10,419
property in the united states government

521
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:14,130
and so they talked about how this was
you know your family I did the soviets

522
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,190
blah blah blah

523
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,970
and ken told me don't put this in your
books I guess I'm

524
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,730
telling it to you on he said ok with
this year book but that

525
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,639
that that was not something I'd service
and what what what they can well

526
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:30,370
we had this in the yard home that we had
this big

527
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:34,290
thing set up those bro I know this photo
maybe from from the lab holmdale

528
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:38,240
he said you know accountants are real
problem and so some accountant decided

529
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,190
that well this is Bella labs property
and so they want to put on the lab

530
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,000
property book

531
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,030
and he said it took me months of
fighting with the bureaucracy to get

532
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,908
this fixed rate you know you know how it
is when account is on that's on the

533
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:49,720
property on oh no we can't do that

534
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,270
so eventually managed to get it often
transferred back to its rightful owner

535
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,139
which is the United States government he
said

536
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:58,179
and I I doubt that point that's never
gonna happen again I was too much to my

537
00:28:58,179 --> 00:28:59,480
life I can't afford

538
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:05,790
so I want to put a sign on it said
property United States government

539
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:10,190
so on so there's there's one don't put
this in your book

540
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,450
I'm than if they'd like it to bring back
to this blue box here on the left

541
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:19,720
I'm this is from a conference will call
JT he was a fun free in 1964 he was

542
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,250
a a student at Rice University and

543
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:27,169
he learned about on freaking from this
AT&T book called principles of

544
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:30,090
electricity applied to telephone and
telegraph work

545
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:34,580
smart guy engineer I and I'm gonna let
him his own words tell you a little bit

546
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,370
about

547
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,450
a about how he came to

548
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:45,450
to build and test this will box in 1964
1965

549
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,980
way

550
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,860
a a both my grandfathers were engineers
my father and all the holes for

551
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,230
engineers are equivalent a my children
are

552
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:05,450
engineers yeah so gravitating I don't
know whether that's the right word

553
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,960
or maybe you're just there to begin with
hey forest genetic

554
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,310
the II my mother believes it's a
recessive trait

555
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,310
so it also occurred to me that I know at
work

556
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,429
and from

557
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,250
what do you do about it when you think
you know how something works well

558
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,400
all those have been schooled in the
scientific method his hand was just

559
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,520
released a Ford scientific method is

560
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,970
you have a theory for something and you
know you're just obligated to test

561
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:36,020
Catherine I just just there's just no
choice but to go tested

562
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:40,260
so what do you have to test yeah well
tested in that building something

563
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,850
okay and so i sat down and I designed up
something

564
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,600
a and I decided not to just stop with

565
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,810
the push buttons turning on pairs times
I decided to build something that

566
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:55,540
incorporate all the knowledge I had and
that turned into something that

567
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,610
sorta funny now he was gonna cost me 50
bucks

568
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:02,820
okay out 50 bucks now back in nineteen
sixty

569
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,129
for I I was actually kind of a lot of
money sure

570
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,890
you know go figure the consumer price
index near you know another you'll find

571
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,700
as well in excess of $500 dollars now

572
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,830
in so is it really we're spending five
hundred dollars

573
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,929
up answers

574
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:22,720
yeah so anyway Aspinall Christmas break
billing thing

575
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,320
and had to go back to rice with me I

576
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,350
by the way the girls just totally
furious i nor her

577
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:33,790
for the whole two weeks except for
attacker Doctor Zhivago

578
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,149
an axe still remember there's a scene in
Doctor Zhivago

579
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,450
where they're on a slightly going out
into the middle of the steps

580
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,620
and it's just cold cold cold cold

581
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,250
and I can remember thinking that I
didn't look nearly as cold as

582
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,190
for the next to maybe help I

583
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:56,270
about my have been ignored it hurt so
thoroughly that is the dedication that

584
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,260
iPhone free has

585
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,940
so he went on to build this a.m. hmm

586
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,410
this a blue box after ignoring his
girlfriend for two weeks

587
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:08,200
and went on to use it in play with it
and test it out

588
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,110
and a the hacker historian

589
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:16,550
and filmmaker Jason Scott read a draft
my book at one point he said no bill

590
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:20,389
he said there their servant and
archetypal steamer story that

591
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:25,270
comes through your book what's that said
well it starts off with a

592
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,610
teenager a curious teenager thinking

593
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:32,630
Wow I wonder what your we did this and I
wonder how this works maybe we should

594
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,530
test this

595
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:36,590
and it ends up with that same teenager
in a room

596
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:40,310
with multiple adult yelling at him and

597
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,399
so sure enough that was in fact exactly
this story

598
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,800
and so a JT at the

599
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,400
the phone free here at 1965 got a visit
from

600
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,740
Southwestern Bell security and John fry
and was rinsing he was interviewed slap

601
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,410
on the wrist

602
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,690
and the special Special Agent fry sent
him

603
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:04,400
a card not find it said thanks very much
enjoy your explanation in your interest

604
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,880
in the communications industry

605
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,570
he actually got to keep his blue box on
JT by the way now

606
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:15,169
I works a he's actually head the a
communications company

607
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:19,760
which as he puts it designs have up
communications systems

608
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,180
that is to say the receive half I'm he
bills eavesdropping equipment

609
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,490
for the National Security Agency and
other United States government

610
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,680
thanks so he is this a straight line for
him and it's the same

611
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,830
the same thing I and i think is very
good at it

612
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:37,240
so the final thing I'd like to tell you
about as a story

613
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,120
about on the International Society a
telephone and busiest

614
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,220
and a mysterious stone MP David I'm

615
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,220
whom I've never met a win

616
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,270
one of my first story is the when I was
interviewing for the first people I

617
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:51,910
interviewed

618
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,970
talked about I'm answering a mysterious

619
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:58,640
add in the Harvard Crimson newspaper it
was signed by be David

620
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,070
I in Saint Louis Missouri and it was a
it was Nadal's almost nonsensical and

621
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,600
it's a fun story I want

622
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,550
I'm give it to you now but his turn
corresponding with be david Turner be

623
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,950
david was mysterious head of this
organization which I think consisted

624
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:14,719
upi/david

625
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,179
the International Society telephone
visits NB David

626
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:23,889
loved paranoia and spiced up and he just
kept popping up in a cab trying to find

627
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:27,668
him from my book I want to talk tomorrow
talk to respond breaks know you know I

628
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:28,859
don't know the David

629
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,690
oh I know a guy who may be fits that
kinda paranoid kind yet another sack I

630
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,030
but he's not gonna talk to you

631
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,160
and so for several years I

632
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,480
you know kept trying to make overtures
to be David never got anywhere

633
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,889
I and then one day Saturday morning

634
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:47,040
6 a.m. my phone rings

635
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,630
and rings and rings I'm in bed and i say
well

636
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:55,100
I'm not gonna answer 6 a.m. the crazy
well turn to be difficult last me

637
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,120
because the phone rang for 10 minutes

638
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,480
so I get up and I go down the hall on a
pick up the phone and say hello

639
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,030
and he's like I told his b-day but I
like talking about your book

640
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:09,850
well you know now's not really a great
time I'm kinda asleep right now can I

641
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:10,500
call you back

642
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,660
no I'm very busy at like talkin now if
you'd like to talk otherwise we don't

643
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,370
have to talk

644
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:18,410
okay II sure I guess we'll talk now then

645
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,129
I'm usable before we talk there are
three things that we have to get

646
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:24,040
straight there are three rules and
circular those rules what room number

647
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,670
one

648
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:28,130
is you can't mention my real name okay
that's fine I'm

649
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,720
I do that my book that's no problem is a
rule number two is like to review

650
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,960
anything right about me

651
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,570
okay well you know we can talk about
that I'm not through topic live with

652
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:36,870
that

653
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:42,370
roderick really get 10 percent the
royalties on your book I said well you

654
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:42,970
know i

655
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:46,110
I don't think I can agree to that be
David is what

656
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,660
think about it just think about it for a
while so I thought about it

657
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:54,609
his no and he said well we have nothing
further to talk about and he hung up

658
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,610
so be David remains an international man
of mystery but what's

659
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:01,710
was particularly funny is that through
various triangulations and whatnot

660
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:06,300
a you know I know I have FBI files about
him I have all sorts of things but I

661
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,420
tell you he is not mentioned by name in
my book

662
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:12,670
good that was one of the three world on
and it's an interesting thing

663
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:17,030
again adjacent Scott word I you know
what I was complaining too much on point

664
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,820
that some other phone freak side over
for the book adjust their fantastic

665
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,380
people the friendly

666
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,540
as I should say by the way the phone
company people in the FBI agent some the

667
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,370
happiest

668
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,540
best adjusted people you'll ever meet
just really nice people and

669
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,200
you know one of the things I was
thinking about was what an FBI agent

670
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,550
with like one thing he neatly

671
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:37,070
you don't like people you like Iraq in
with people not tentative make people I

672
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:37,960
think happier

673
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,890
later in life on but on the other hand a
few the phone freak by no means all but

674
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:43,640
a handful

675
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,319
really kinda strange and shocking right

676
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,570
with me on and a Justin Scott's comment
he said

677
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:55,700
well Phil you're talking about a group
of people whose claim to fame was

678
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:59,260
abusing piece of equipment for hours on
end until it did something they can brag

679
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,410
about to their friends

680
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,670
oddly enough this doesn't always lead to
great outcomes later in life

681
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:06,680
you know but but at the same time you
know that that us

682
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,720
right that's how many other people in
this room are and

683
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,440
is what it is so you see you see you see
all kinds you see it in a very hopeful

684
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,690
phone freaks me see the

685
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,760
slightly more paranoid a you know I 110
percent world history book kinda people

686
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,780
okay um so

687
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:26,540
I'd like to conclude with a few lessons
learned here um

688
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,770
again after first ongoing FBI evidence
thing i've a

689
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:35,080
real magnetic tape with an evidence tag
and the FBI Laboratory thing am

690
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,819
the very first lesson that I learned
from working on this book

691
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:44,730
was and this applies to any project
whether it's a book any big project is a

692
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,100
project like this is way harder than you
think

693
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,150
right it takes longer involves more
people it requires

694
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,360
well frankly giving piggyback ride to
John Draper and his

695
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,680
in his front room you know at its best
if you want an interview from Ghana's

696
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,319
we're gonna do

697
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,820
on and if you thought about you probably
wouldn't do it

698
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:06,610
right I mean it's just that's the
reality of it and so therefore the

699
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:09,000
lesson number two is don't think about
it too hard

700
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,040
regular if you wanna it true again any
big project is

701
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,390
once once you're starting off you know
once you're on this power

702
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,600
you really want to run news really wanna
let go

703
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,330
you wanna you want to commit to anyone
who were totally and so I try not to

704
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:22,799
think about

705
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,360
about that too much in fortunately I
married to an extremely

706
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,700
understanding life he supported me in
this lesson number three

707
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,090
is save everything

708
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:39,890
um even if you're not doing any sort of
historical project you never know when

709
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,859
somebody like me is gonna show up

710
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,050
and say hey I want to talk to you about
this amazing thing that you were

711
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:45,700
involved in

712
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,150
and believe me when I talk to to various
both countries in telephone company

713
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,470
security agents but especially the
telephone company security agents they

714
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,470
would say things like

715
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,750
what do you mean the special thing I was
involved and I you know

716
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,660
I was a phone company security agent for
god sake how how special is that

717
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,140
right a still I want to hear about your
story cuz I think there are people who

718
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,109
are interested in it

719
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:08,420
and in many cases these people would
just

720
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:13,310
save just their pakrats never they were
you saw that photo can hopper and all

721
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,850
all the documents and that was repeated
time after time after time I talk to one

722
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,390
guy who's that telephone company
security agent for Southern Bell

723
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,980
had a conversation with him on the phone
two weeks later

724
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,860
big-box a step show that this guy is in
his eighties so I go through the back to

725
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,210
stuff just great documents

726
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:33,200
I you know I call back on SEDAR I'll
send it back to his I kinda know I

727
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,960
really don't need at this point you know
you can just keep it

728
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,290
on you know so

729
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,310
pakrats are just incredibly important
historian Sir you have

730
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:45,340
anything that you think I've historical
value scan it

731
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,690
digitize it whatever never to the paper
if you want but please stay because it's

732
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,190
going to be important to somebody
someplace

733
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:56,480
so the final thing that I didn't really
expect

734
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,390
to I didn't really expect going into
this

735
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:04,109
was if you think with the phone phreaks
did was impressive

736
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,480
try invention the telephone system from
scratch

737
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,950
I didn't really know that much about the
history the telephone company or AT&T

738
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,180
near Bell Labs

739
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,210
going into this and

740
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,070
I you know and in fact actually if
anything I have a little bit of disdain

741
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:21,470
for the most stupid phone company
designed the system based on tones that

742
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,680
anybody can get into you know

743
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,990
fourteen-year-old the tone generator or
even who can whistle can break into it

744
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,440
what a bunch of morons

745
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,850
right but no these guys were building

746
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:33,670
there were something really probably in
some sense the hardest engineering

747
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,570
project in the world

748
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:39,710
are you may be second only to the space
program and the atomic bomb

749
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:43,180
right building the world's telephone
network building a computer network

750
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,060
building machines they could do
automatic routing and communicate with

751
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,080
one another before the transistor

752
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,319
or the computer anything like this you
know they had

753
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,990
tough problems on their plate and they
did got right to work in solve them

754
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:58,000
and they solve them in ways that seem
just crazy today

755
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,890
but saw what they did and in the process

756
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:06,970
you know day one's Bell Labs one seven
nobel prizes for fundamental physical

757
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,350
research right

758
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:12,120
you the Big Bang cosmic microwave
background radiation they detected

759
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,259
your shortlist to their inventions the
transistor the negative feedback

760
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,390
amplifier

761
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:22,150
I cell phones solar cells the laser
digital transmissions communication

762
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,490
satellites

763
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:29,000
so it seems appropriate to give them the
second to last word

764
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,040
the second to last word is the

765
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:39,040
something you probably didn't know that
they invented which is the a music video

766
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,500
do

767
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:51,500
do

768
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:57,910
the Brembo tentative doubles wave

769
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,259
Commons sure play Herald

770
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,870
feed to him

771
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:09,509
that machine and mom more

772
00:42:09,509 --> 00:42:13,190
stand

773
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,050
you

774
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:22,050
old

775
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:43,450
the mobile phone main rd is she on
Holmes George

776
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:46,650
with cellular voice feed March

777
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:50,890
and PCM Richard mean William and cringe
and his dirty

778
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:57,890
party sharply dressed

779
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:02,340
tired

780
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:09,340
lunch

781
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:30,960
so let's have a round of applause for
Bell out

782
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:36,830
that the thing that I really didn't
didn't realize going into this

783
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:40,569
is yet these guys a these guys bill

784
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:46,930
a telephone system and they did it from
scratch right they did from nothing from

785
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:49,569
stone knives and bear skins as mister
Spock would say

786
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:53,430
and it's really interesting then it took

787
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:56,710
the phone phreaks to turn it into a
playground

788
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:00,140
and that that also deserves applause

789
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,740
that also deserves yeah you know real
real praise because

790
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,090
is this idea of taking mundane
utilitarian technology

791
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:11,000
and turning into something cool really
at some level

792
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,690
making are with it right this desire to
play with technology

793
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,960
but I think we all have on and so

794
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,270
I really came to as a result of all this
in from talking to the people at the lab

795
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:23,560
an AT&T in the phone company

796
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,620
I came over just a deep deep respect for
really in some sense both sides at the

797
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,460
house right

798
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,530
the people who built this network and
the people who just simply could not

799
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:32,810
resist playing with it

800
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:37,240
so like to if I can get the

801
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,820
video back you know that you want that

802
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:44,750
so I'm now the shameless Commercial Club
I

803
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:48,840
February 2013 a from Grove Atlantic
Press

804
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,760
exploding the phone: with a foreword by
Steve Wozniak this is

805
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,320
my book on history phone freaking the
untold story the

806
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,610
teenagers and outlaws who hacked Ma Bell
available wherever find fun free history

807
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:01,640
books are sold

808
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,830
in his is not yet available for
pre-order on Amazon but it will be in

809

the next few months

810
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,870
and there are up postcards

811
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:12,960
the both at the water cooler in the
backing up here at the front

a and I have a mailing list that you can
get on if you're interested if you go to

813
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,920
www dot history a phone freaking .org

814
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,920
or soon exploding the phone: dot com

815
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,450
I and I'd really like to thank everybody
who has contributed

816
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:30,850
a to this book including be David a.m.

817
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:35,930
at you know its it's been you people say
are writing a book is a lonely thing

818
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:39,330
if it's the only thing as the most
credible only thing I can imagine and

819
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,970
it it relies so much on people making
introductions

820
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:46,450
coming up with you know processing my
for request doing all this stuff

821
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:50,170
and also allowing me to steal various
images and things from my talk

822
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:57,170
so on to thank you very much and I look
bigger question

823
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:16,020
question

824
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,070
there's there's a a there's a mic from
the middle so the question was was the

825
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,560
first time I take apart a phone

826
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,880
gosh I don't think you remember back
that far

827
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,930
but it but I will want one story that
somebody told me about their experience

828
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,009
taking apart a phone

829
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:33,030
on this guy said well we had an
all-white phones it was really cheaply

830
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,850
made fun

831
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:37,290
he said and I knew at the time that the
ringing voltage

832
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:42,790
in the telephone was 90 balls and 90
balls is pretty close to 110 volt

833
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,350
him so if you put this into a 110 volts
maybe it'll ring

834
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:50,440
now this was it turns out the all the
old bones with the actual mechanical

835
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,950
ringers witness to do like the need to
be twenty hurts

836
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:56,190
but this is a friendly different more
modern phone so

837
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:59,180
you plug it in and sure enough he and
his friend were there it started to rain

838
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,799
what do you do in your phone's ringing

839
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:07,130
you answer it but when you answer the
phone the impedance changes it a lot

840
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,650
closer to a direction or

841
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,670
and as his friends started to reach for
the phone he said it was one other

842
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:13,710
slow-motion

843
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:18,330
things with menu

844
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:19,900
and his friend picked up the phone and

845
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,080
and he concluded said it was a really
cheaply made

846
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:29,279
phone you you can see the fire ball
inside right before it exploded good and

847
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,990
and I never thought about until this
very moment but there you have it

848
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:36,380
exploding the phone: but time

849
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,570
and great working thanks thanks for
sharing so much him

850
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:43,150
having free can work with wise and
smelly 32 the time

851
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,300
%uh and having had encounters with the
law I am

852
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,570
I managed to escape that's that's
another story arm

853
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,600
what did you find out with the with the
telephone please as we call them back

854
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,170
then

855
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,200
sure I and TPC the phone company at a
the

856
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,770
yes president's analyst um and many
those Asians

857
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:03,640
have some summer more so they have a
humorous outlook at the time I thought

858
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,650
you were doing God's work we can you
share with us and I'm sure it's a great

859
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,400
question that is something I spent a lot
of time talking to the

860
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,160
to the telephone company security agents
that I i talk two for the book

861
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,440
on the first thing was the thing that
really stressed

862
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,830
is a true but if you're talking company
security agent the vast majority of

863
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,060
stuff that you do has nothing to do with
fun freaks

864
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:26,850
break it has to do with you know jenny
was embezzling from the

865
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:31,210
the company till or you know Joe back to
instruct into

866
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:34,700
somebody's car and so we gotta go and
deal with that I'm so you know just

867
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,040
it you know sting eighty or ninety
percent of stuff that make up the duty

868
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,460
is over

869
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,570
kind ever a you know that

870
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:45,080
you know shoe leather a telephone
company there any kind of security

871
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,040
officer to accompany

872
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,140
un what was interesting was

873
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,770
it really it very quite a bit for the
most part I think they felt the fun free

874
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,030
for just a pain in the butt

875
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:58,480
right like from their perspective it's
like who wouldn't do this stuff

876
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,740
like these guys are out there they're
stealing phone company hard hats out

877
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,680
rocks

878
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,640
and you know they're they're coming up
with ways to hack into this or that or

879
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,359
whatever and

880
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,600
as far as these guys are concerned from
his security guys risley

881
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,830
yeah okay I mean come on surely there's
something better to do than that right

882
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:16,730
to there's a certain amount of
irritation

883
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:21,110
with it on I think the the guys at Bell
Labs who tend to be engineers

884
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:24,100
right this year have appreciated this
man like you know can we get this we

885
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,920
sort of understand we we get the hacker
ethic a little bit more than the average

886
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,900
cell phone company security officer
although

887
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,080
even that varied from place to place on
you definitely

888
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,100
a can hopper had much more are they a

889
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,270
you know doing as you put it doing the
Lord's work you know it's like this is

890
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,630
our network we built it

891
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:43,640
it's supposed to work in this particular
way people shouldn't be abusing in this

892
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,210
way

893
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:48,500
you know to it really very I would say
for the most part though the interesting

894
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,110
thing is

895
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:53,170
and I got this from some other countries
as well the company figured out

896
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:56,720
even by the nineteen seventies mister to
do in prosecutions

897
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,530
for the most part they realized you know

898
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:03,780
with yes we have to deter people from
doing this

899
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:07,250
but no we understand we don't really
particularly want to send anybody to

900
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,400
jail for doing it

901
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,750
and so there's a couple phone phreaks a
in the book a

902
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:14,990
Danny MGM who are who work in San Jose

903
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:18,570
and you know is as they put it there
like to you know the the phone company

904
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:22,060
was actually really nice to us they call
this the caller apparently tried to get

905
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:22,940
us to stop

906
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:26,200
and you know eventually yeah how we got
arrested and you know one who spent a

907
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,290
couple nights in jail

908
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:30,750
but you know he said in the end there's
really nothing bad I can say about them

909
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:34,640
because you know yet we were kinda Damen
kept doing after they told us not to and

910
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,440
it was clear

911
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,730
that you know we back actually I Danny
tells a story about having

912
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:43,910
having defense and social engineering to
to you set up a new brand new got taken

913
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:47,200
out of service he called back in to try
and convince the telephone companies

914
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:47,890
which men

915
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:51,650
on to put it back in service and

916
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,950
and the telephone companies which means
they will hang on a second he put them

917
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,410
on hold about a minute later

918
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:59,540
the boys a George Alex the chief the

919
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:03,620
chief Special Agent in the senate's area
came online security guy

920
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:07,140
and his first words were Danny Danny
what you doing

921
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:11,098
a

922
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:14,630
so I yet you it did that match your

923
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:18,409
you're dealing with it often point to a
little bit a lot of us were arrested

924
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:21,579
a couldn't get a phone number legally
for years

925
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,160
better

926
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,029
three or four thought that they were
doing God's work I think at the time

927
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:27,920
into an and one at aforesaid

928
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,010
you don't want people know you can make
a move on Sat Nav found

929
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:34,460
right and i'm glad the case is over me
ask what your that was

930
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,770
this was seventy 3 yeah meter

931
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:41,070
and that that that kinda makes sense
especially if you go back to the early

932
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:44,350
days with little bit more on the well
that's really what were you saw that

933
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:47,900
that letter to JT right up liking I
think thank you for showing your blue

934
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,560
box and

935
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,370
you know your interest in
telecommunications or whatever and not

936
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:53,839
get that definitely wasn't happening
when 1976

937
00:51:53,840 --> 00:52:00,840
nice work thanks again thank you

938
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:07,260
any other questions hey

939
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,530
I we want reasons got to hit quoting
from

940
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:13,750
as when a quick statement because I'll
be in video loving this man

941
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:17,750
I see this only people who write the
stories and they tend to be the shallow

942
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:21,470
one and a half page kinda this is
something that's funny for today

943
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:24,240
I've been watching film work on this
thing for half a decade when he brought

944
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,250
me and not saying

945
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,859
the think

946
00:52:27,859 --> 00:52:30,470
no don't think about that the two years

947
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:35,250
did you tell me people died that you've
interviewed quite a few

948
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:39,140
action right now in that their stories
are now gone if it wasn't for Phil

949
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,250
and I think that's really important
people understand so

950
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:45,910
things that your pardo even if it's
something is new with IRC your if you

951
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:47,859
work it whether he do anything

952
00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:52,130
please collect those stories because
records from your body's talking there

953
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,180
because that stuff will be invaluable
for people like bill later or we won't

954
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,380
get the real stories

955
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,859
