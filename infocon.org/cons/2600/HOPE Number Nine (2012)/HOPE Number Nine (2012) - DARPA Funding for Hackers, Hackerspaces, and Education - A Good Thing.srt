1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:03,020
arm you know and now I think I'll

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,430
in diversity of opinion in thought and
feeling and all this is what makes our

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,730
communities so

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,799
amazing you mean we all do so many a
things and we're willing to share it

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,740
with one another and that's what makes
for really wonderful

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,619
arm community and this panel

7
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:24,119
is a a bunch people who have

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,119
thought a lot about darpa funding for
their projects or their hackers bases

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,960
and their lives we all have

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,230
welcome from a a very different place in

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,280
in all this and um and so

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,309
for organ is share our thoughts are
feeling

13
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,579
our thoughts feelings opinions and the

14
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:49,460
in a respectful way of course and some
yeah I hope the

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,050
everyone in the audience can you respect
people for their differing opinions

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,699
because that's what as I said mixer for
a strong community community

17
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:03,358
myself I had to have pretty strong
opinions on this is prime most in the

18
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,049
gnome

19
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,420
I am totally biased even though I'm a
moderator am biased

20
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,960
but I don't want to use this panel to a
push for my

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,880
a point to view I really do want this
panel to

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,420
present issues around darpa

23
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,420
funding and other funding sources that
may or may not

24
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,930
I love will fit in with your goals are

25
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,060
and see you know does that matter for me

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,640
it does for other people maybe maybe not
we'll find how

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,990
arm now so

28
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,490
from just a a briefing a brief

29
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,790
word about my the background

30
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,079
in this subject %uh in April

31
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,610
I made a public statement on Facebook
and Google

32
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,220
various social networks all exactly the
same message

33
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,700
and others read it it's very simple are

34
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,430
it's official I'm greatly saddened that
I won't be able to help at this year's

35
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,920
US Maker Faires after they applied for
an accepted a grant from tarp I'll

36
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,429
I look forward to working in playing at
Maker Faire again

37
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:15,459
after they are no longer associated with
time bomb that was my entire statement

38
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:20,980
caused quite a flurry in various sectors
over the internets

39
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,700
are some respect for some not and it was
not easy to deal with for me personally

40
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,849
but some

41
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,549
I I'm really glad I made that statement
cuz it

42
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,739
got a lot of dialogue happening around
the subject where there really are no

43
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,650
simple easy rights and wrongs and is
actually quite complex if you try to

44
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,519
think about it

45
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,629
arm you know just for me Maker Faire

46
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:49,310
has been incredible unambiguously
wonderful part of my life since the

47
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,150
first one in 2006

48
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,540
and ever imagined I would have to think
about difficult issues surrounding my

49
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,780
involvement with them

50
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,709
arm and ago I don't really want to go
into my

51
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:05,000
are reasons for for this but it was

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,849
weighing not easy choice for me to come
to you to not help

53
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,590
cuz it I miss her greatly arm

54
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,450
to home darpa for people who don't know

55
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,190
is the defense advanced research
projects

56
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,319
agency and according to their website

57
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:30,220
their mission is to maintain the
technological superiority over the US

58
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,120
military

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,530
and prevent technological surprises from
harming our national security by

60
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,519
sponsoring

61
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,890
revolutionary high payoff research
bridging the gap between fundamental

62
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,370
discoveries and their military use

63
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,060
are that's from their website from the
Wikipedia page the current

64
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,780
budget is 3.2 billion dollars this year

65
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,099
arm dark green ounce

66
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,860
are becoming more more available arm the

67
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,400
the one for maker fair use for their
mentor program

68
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,060
was ten million dollars for a renewable
over a number of years

69
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,439
and arm for putting a thousand
hackerspace is in high schools

70
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:18,120
essentially and arm

71
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,419
they are making grants available through
someone from our community you calls

72
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:23,698
himself mileage

73
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,860
to we've ever met isnt on the panel but
he didn't wanna

74
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,910
take a a public positions so
unfortunately you won't be here but

75
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,530
the panel we have i think is really
representative a lot a really cool

76
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,750
points view

77
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,479
arm so to start some ground rules just
to keep things cool

78
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:48,479
arm I'll you know again we don't only do
agree with each other but week certainly

79
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,508
can all respect each other for
differences al

80
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:55,330
and I would a requests that people in
the audience

81
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,570
is don't applaud during the panel

82
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,900
are after the panel go crazy but

83
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,050
that jazz can be kinda disruptive for
expressing

84
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,280
a plan to me a different points of view

85
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,060
so um rather than me introduce people
one

86
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,430
each to you introduce yourselves and no

87
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,639
you know just brief be in say you know
what you done

88
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,440
in the hacker community in that got you
here

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,000
some sites like a valve on labs
cofounded about three years ago

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,750
and reason on this panel today is
because we were one of the hackerspace

91
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,150
is

92
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,360
that is part of the hackerspace space
program that is

93
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,539
getting up five hundred thousand dollar
grant to work on space projects at

94
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:42,169
hackerspace is

95
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:46,130
and

96
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,389
and Willow blue I A have an ejector
Amazon's and I work now with an

97
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:51,889
organization called keep

98
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:55,759
pounds which brings together hacker and
maker and development communities

99
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,530
humanitarian response organizations

100
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,850
and so have it I have to interact with
military

101
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,620
did a because they're really good at
moving stuff in disaster

102
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,080
and i also think that hackers spaces are
not only

103
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,169
are as a completely separate viewpoint I
think the hackerspace is our

104
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:17,880
places in education and also good
indicators eg

105
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,330
resiliency in a community as we care
about talking to each other

106
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,219
and surviving the zombie apocalypse

107
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,120
to my friends on the apocalypse on my
name is Matt Joyce

108
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,850
I was a member at NYC resistor until I
took a year

109
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,770
the contract you get up at nasa ames
research center two years ago

110
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,659
which has just recently ended I am still
in service is going to be doing Star

111
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,190
Partner

112
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,419
I am him singleton and I'm a librarian
Montero

113
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:50,930
and for the last three or four years
I've been travel and live at home

114
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,990
outer space is and try not to bring tax
base and flybridge basically

115
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,849
I'm my interest in the tough for me arm

116
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:02,849
cases really I just want to block it is
better to be quite popular

117
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:06,229
I do library was doing that research
hand

118
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:09,969
ans lot of stuff like military approved
eccentrics at Reno's

119
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,539
I think why it from here now

120
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:16,880
sorry one arm soldiers start off with

121
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,030
some you know just generally

122
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,270
bite is this particular topic interest
you

123
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:29,340
and anyone wanna its say that

124
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:35,020
because for will am I think it's
important to talk about this because

125
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,620
our lot the military in general

126
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,330
is a fact it out there and we have to
figure out how we're going to interact

127
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,469
with it

128
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,729
I'm very much on the fence constantly
and where I stand on this

129
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:52,960
I'm I I wish that we were the sort of
community that we would all

130
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,090
stand together and decide that we don't
need them and they were going to build

131
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,069
our new society in very

132
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:01,470
II staunchly state that a move forward
with it

133
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,560
or not and show I'm

134
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,389
I'm up to do the best that we can and be
as loving and supportive

135
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:11,729
I've each other on as we can be in the
meantime

136
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:18,490
so i really wanna hear what everyone is
up to and that's why I am here

137
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,090
so the fundamental reason that I want to
be on this panel was too

138
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,110
focus on what I believe is the real
issue at hand here which is

139
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,349
ethics as relates specifically to stem
initiatives and engineering in

140
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:31,569
particular

141
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:35,709
on the things that we do at hackerspace
is and in the open source community

142
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:39,779
are by and large released out into the
world without much guidance

143
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,360
we create things mean that the loose on
the world in the

144
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,370
will be coopted by other people and made
to be used

145
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,459
so I think it's important that people
sit down and have a conversation

146
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:53,970
with the people that they know and with
themselves about what it is that you're

147
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,130
working on

148
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:01,370
and whether or not you're able to accept
wall come amid

149
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,779
my main interest was be make top a
partnership I'm again

150
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:08,100
for reasons for a summer tonight was
problems have SX

151
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,580
and was very little discussion about
this online really and I was a

152
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,959
the reason why won't be here was to have
more face to face discussion to kind of

153
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:21,370
continue the discussion about was really
a very a pretty complex issue

154
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,230
sorry I we grim how far they have space
space program

155
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,510
and I also am on the fence and

156
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,250
we are going to the way we're going to
structure the program

157
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,690
and often the houses that the dark for
funding is going to the hackerspace

158
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,260
space program which is

159
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,510
group that of maps for like to meet up
so it's a separate entity

160
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,029
thats that's going to enable everyone to
participate

161
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:51,779
and in a way that's 'em could that I
think

162
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:56,029
down it is kinda interesting um you know
from our various points views it still

163
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:00,880
a not obvious stew us here and I think
anyone is thought through

164
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,040
tried to think through these for
themselves

165
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,949
that it's not in easy's said issues too

166
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,060
come to balance off with one another's
pluses

167
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,740
there's minuses and some other pluses
and minuses are hard to

168
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,829
balance of like a plus for the Maker
Faire

169
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:24,060
arm associated program mentors a
thousand hackerspace in

170
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,630
have high schools I mean anyone here I i
think we think that's an amazingly cool

171
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:34,850
name are the minuses are going to be
different for different people

172
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,860
on from my point of view on you know

173
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,000
the people a dar par doing it to enhance
their goals and from my point of view

174
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,910
those aren't my goals

175
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,969
so I'm somehow helping them if I'm
hoping that program

176
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,610
how do you balance that are so

177
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,510
for that out I really don't know I

178
00:10:54,510 --> 00:11:00,000
to the best the at the time go best of
my ability to come up with my choice

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,149
is that the right one I don't know arm

180
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,579
so be 100 address that out in

181
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:09,610
like a SciTech for the space program

182
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,050
I get dressed like the pluses and
minuses

183
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,930
char1 other the things that I am kinda
concerned about

184
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,269
is that you know if you if you go piece
a salary in red

185
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:25,230
water it's gonna be rad if you're cool
and you get thirty percent a few times

186
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,730
work on a project that's going to be
related to Google

187
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,610
arm I'm just wondering how this darpa
defense

188
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,240
contracts money is going to influence
these projects

189
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,180
um sorry I want to bring that to the
table

190
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,350
hey actually someone from the DOD once
told me that

191
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:51,140
sometimes the worst thing that can
happen is that your project gets funded

192
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,620
I not just from them but in general on

193
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,340
all one other things that this community
is so fantastic at

194
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,650
is doing stuff for the popsicle stick in
a shoestring

195
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,839
that we found in the couch on what we
make do with what we can and that's what

196
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,029
makes us incredible

197
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:13,850
I am we open source things through were
awesome it that and so

198
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,230
its it's vital to me that we ask what do
we need money four

199
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,900
how much do we need is it absolutely
necessary

200
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,750
and then what water all over the sources
that we might gain

201
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:33,950
funding for it from and if you've done
all of that research then thats

202
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,460
then I think you're good to go in
whatever you decide I think you're an

203
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:37,900
adult

204
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,160
you can do whatever you want signs don't
hurt out that

205
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,680
evolution a bad idea whatever are the
evolution of an idea

206
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,230
on the deck I am

207
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,690
cousins was going with positives and
negatives um

208
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:58,400
I think the positive is obvious money
money provides capacity to do things

209
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,520
it is the lubricant to the engine ideas

210
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,310
on darpa in and of itself as stated in
its mission

211
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,410
has a military goals very specific
military goal that means a

212
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,000
anything that you do in relation to them
is in effect

213
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,230
furthering the more that military powers
in the United States means you are in

214
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,830
fact

215
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,290
a secondary supporter I'll

216
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,750
the machine that does exist for the
functional purpose

217
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,500
%uh military conflict in short killing
people

218
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,750
were defending people on the positive is
that stem initiatives

219
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,770
are good it's one of the biggest
problems that we have today

220
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,790
in in america is our educational system
is in many places failing

221
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,099
and children need a better

222
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,260
outreach for kinetic learning they need
would shops again they need to be able

223
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,060
to get access to CNC equipment

224
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,060
programming to technical resources like
first

225
00:13:54,060 --> 00:14:00,980
something like this helps provide that
yes first apostles the the thousands

226
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,120
hyperspace is not known in North America
actually worldwide

227
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,280
entry years it's not just the US people
keep saying it's the US it's not scary

228
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,000
worldwide

229
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,540
so you're looking at a huge and like
it's

230
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,459
Bay sleepy or for hikers basis and her
culture like that enormous right

231
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:22,200
a 1000 watt wind I'm 10 the minuses and
I mean one for me is your is a palms a

232
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,329
military recruitment

233
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,570
and STEM education in high schools I

234
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,829
again darpa does not recruit as not a
concern I'm people set up to me and I'm

235
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:31,670
well aware of to

236
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,970
however army US Army recruiters do
recruit and they're extremely interested

237
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,360
in STEM projects is actually a very
interesting article I have your call

238
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,709
what's all the talk about stem from the
January 2012 issue of the Army recruiter

239
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:45,620
magazine

240
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,770
you just get the stuff online and busy
encouraging Army recruiters to

241
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,829
going to stem classrooms so you
understand that sounds a lot like

242
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:57,550
you know the dark to make project
running the Conchords in recruits go in

243
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:57,860
there

244
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,200
and is actually a great selu report all
soldiers of misfortune

245
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,030
that looks at and problems with military
proven high schools

246
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,280
an awesome legality military problems
and high schools

247
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,360
in 2002 day ya Senate rough I was called
the Optional Protocol

248
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,000
I miss call the Optional Protocol on
involving two children in armed conflict

249
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,180
and this makes it illegal in the US to
try to try only crew any child under the

250
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,140
age of 17

251
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,040
involuntarily I miss you look at the
ACLU report

252
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,880
I'm involuntary recruitment of children
as young as 11 is very common in the US

253
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,140
and we we know Army recruiters go after
you know minorities

254
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,980
and you know people who work in class
for example tend to be targets for

255
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,640
recruiters

256
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,140
I'm so again as as a minus for me that's
a really big one

257
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:50,180
you know what you have basie hyperspace
in high schools been used to facilitate

258
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,040
military provement and in what in this
case which may be

259
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,459
illegal I in and a follow-up to that
yeah I am

260
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:00,660
I I went to school in in the Midwest

261
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,719
in very rural area there there already

262
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,130
recruiters that are there all the time
on

263
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:12,650
and made it my personal opinion is the
best thing you can ever give anyone is

264
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,500
more knowledge

265
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,280
and so they're already there

266
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,750
and we can keep pushing them out and
trying to push them out but I don't

267
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,319
understand how that it

268
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:27,940
at into on it's confounded argument

269
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:33,540
in that that the factors are there
they're all tangled up together

270
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,709
I bus also reported I just one hour
possono

271
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:39,760
your response but response that quickly
and I'll I don't

272
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,270
no clinical so

273
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:48,370
I on positive aspect of it is that it is
going to be PR is going to be bringing

274
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,230
money Thacker spaces

275
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,600
and that thing that goes on a
hackerspace as light as hardware hacking

276
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,230
and hardware hacking takes money it's
not like software hacking we can just

277
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,270
download a library and corporate &
venture project in a few hours

278
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,300
get that money to make things happen and
I think this is going to be more funding

279
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,599
for hackerspace is

280
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,970
and more the ways they were gonna do it
is we're going to take projects and put

281
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,970
them through crowdfunding site

282
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,439
and that crowdfunding site has agreed to
match the funding

283
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,709
and what we're gonna do is match at all
so so we'll have tripled leading

284
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:23,579
of projects going to these crowdfunding
sites so we'll know which ones are

285
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:27,780
our economy could to make happen

286
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,629
I'm you're just like it's quite funny
actually my spot people you're for that

287
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,550
the statute always joking

288
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,300
when I said about the level of US like
military proven US high schools yes

289
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,168
utahans make this stuff up

290
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:43,200
and that the thing is I E a whole up you
feel about this

291
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,669
in the hockey community what do you
think that what you're basically doing

292
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:48,320
is given a gateway

293
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,500
and if you you've massive public PRI
governors house worldwide

294
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,740
and the connection is gonna be in
people's minds

295
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,590
um dis military hacker recruitment
connection

296
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:03,050
if this is not the first this is not the
first time project is one called DOD

297
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,280
star basis we pullin

298
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,899
in here might be from her way honor and
already is quite and this

299
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,450
explicitly to go look quite explicit
about to do use this for recruitment are

300
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,470
very interested in

301
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,500
and actually I'm someone give testimony
a Cena and just basically all right said

302
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,540
yeah we love DOD Starbase because it's a
great way to recruit high school kids

303
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,530
military

304
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:25,020
just you know blatantly I am so this is
Pablo

305
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,100
do you want a connection to be made you
know

306
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,840
you know but I did it and it is gonna be
made like that is upon you for all you

307
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,580
can already see them you know we see
articles like this to sharpening the

308
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,760
knives going

309
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,620
can't wait to get in there you know to
get to these kids to start recruiting

310
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,419
them

311
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:44,179
I mean you read the Army recruiter
manual stuffed it in your shopping about

312
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:47,330
you know you the schoolwork this SRP
programs grip or

313
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,260
recruiting program issue not target them
as young as you can

314
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:57,150
like get them young because what I under
17 it's too late

315
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,850
yeah so um there's a lot of things that
recruit in schools not just

316
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,080
the DOD on there's religious
organizations

317
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,820
there's cap corporate interests
capitalist

318
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,870
organizations you got to high school in
Silicon Valley and I surely the kids are

319
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,880
running around trying again and get help
hackathons and things like that

320
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,460
and all those abs corporate sponsorships
and so on and so forth I think it's

321
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,940
important to remember

322
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,280
that the DOT's existence in the military
that exist today is a reflection of

323
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,450
ourselves

324
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,679
in so much as cool as a reflection of
ourselves or

325
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,330
a any religion your community is a
reflection of your community

326
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,830
and hacker spaces are in effect
communities and we will be reflection

327
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,139
I'll the people that are around us I
think it's important to remember that

328
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,540
when someone is recruiting in the
community

329
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,149
they're not alone hands there's a reason
they're treating its because

330
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:50,480
there's money invested in this we
invested that money

331
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,010
all of us so that's what I

332
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,940
it goes back to for me and said I I
think that it's an absolute mess is set

333
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,980
necessity to have these

334
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,980
relations in thats was education

335
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,560
for the kids and for adults and I think
that we shall have access 10 tax bases

336
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,020
and

337
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,350
things they bring on I would prefer if
it was in the military

338
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:16,550
and perverted if that if it for this
community doing that

339
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,678
on I think that we absolutely need to be
teachers we need two hands the

340
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,730
on the attention span to stick with the
kid over the course of an entire

341
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,940
semester

342
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,120
hopefully over several years I

343
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,120
I would love to see us do do this

344
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,520
arm but right now this is this is a
route

345
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,770
and its basically the only one

346
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,870
that the thing is there are you know the
reason why do goal

347
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:46,370
and to librarians say you know and
hyperspace the same please come to the

348
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,360
library

349
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,050
you know there are other ways of doing
this right like one concern

350
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,240
for me really with this is very few
neutral space is left in the world

351
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,370
nothing but public lively you know very
good and you

352
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,590
anyone can come to the library pretty
much do re whatever the hell you want to

353
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,178
read do whatever you want to do

354
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,790
look whatever you want on the computer
mites we are completely neutral

355
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,830
and we'll defend your right to read and
look whatever you want to the bitter end

356
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,090
Justin why we're there to a large extent
that was my original interest in

357
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,340
hyperspace is

358
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,530
know the model is very very much there's
a neutral space for you comin

359
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,690
and you can destroy whatever the hell
you want set on fire

360
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,530
we don't care okay as long as you clean
up after yourself

361
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,928
yes unforeseen public lotteries we don't
need to clean up after themselves

362
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:33,480
and they're like pee in themselves and
still lost her

363
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,600
people cannot be stories later on
society like me you know you guys

364
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,740
like I always laugh in her mother deal
with the public we deal with the

365
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,030
with %uh public tonight I'm

366
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:47,200
it Andy wet themselves look for them I'm

367
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,340
the under sink like a main concern is
talking about like he's going to do

368
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,080
like the idea is education am No Deal
dollar Tryp

369
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,428
sorry but I have to look at charms
accent sorry I'm not much the Irish so I

370
00:21:57,429 --> 00:21:59,240
tried to keep an eye to

371
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,080
and sometimes a causal 28 when I get
excited so if I say sup someone please

372
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,000
warn me

373
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,679
and ate like to Pluto yeah you're no
longer even lightly

374
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,120
you know you're crazy right is now
looking more charming

375
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,909
is going on and ahead

376
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:18,880
the my main concerns I she'd unveiled
already when he does that P or

377
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,710
for deciding I'm is the example of the
high school in Sebastopol

378
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,649
and which i think actually delores kids
go to the high school I should be nice

379
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:27,310
white ones reasons why was chosen

380
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,620
and very much that despite notices a
jewel in the crown fordice

381
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,919
for the Tampa Bay Program I'm due to the
high school is like

382
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,320
i think is an award-winning high school
winless the high school for like point

383
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,270
wealthy people

384
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,639
you know senator kids there am how is
this gonna

385
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:46,740
panel when we get to 100 to 200

386
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,940
to 400 to a thousand

387
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,060
you note this model is not gonna you
know it's gonna be I really do believe

388
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,129
this legal like that

389
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,960
right is gonna be like substitute
teachers getting paid couple dollars an

390
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,909
hour

391
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:02,350
stockings this class can use teachers on
the shoot a paper check your face

392
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,700
and then it's gonna be you know
recruiters gone I can do that for you

393
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,780
you know I can do much better job than
you can and also even

394
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,850
while is large parts that you know

395
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,200
are be left out discussion about to die
from a thing I wonder is the actual

396
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,060
model the doctor once

397
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,149
I'm is got three parts the first is the
jewel public

398
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:25,750
fabrication the second is using social
media to allow kids to cooperate on line

399
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,159
and authorities arm design challenges
the design chance a quite interesting

400
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,169
because they want to do robots

401
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:35,590
go karts and on my hand am

402
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,310
aircraft which is drones drones on you

403
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,440
I'm and services to dot design chance to
revolve around

404
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,179
sore right now um your discussion is no
it's all can be quite open the kids will

405
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,210
be let do whatever they want to do

406
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,760
you know it's true I have told freedom
which is in Sebastopol

407
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,310
but you will see us the start to develop
Notre is actually a mission plan here

408
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:01,690
you know I know she read is quite funny
I'm the mission plan

409
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,490
in discussion a quote from the two
people that are a managing the mental

410
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,610
project is to

411
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,720
the Tema correlating why demand and Paul
remain call

412
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,090
and I disagree or for presentation to
give I'm when race leader were

413
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,209
are looking for people to actually and
bid on funding

414
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,700
to bid for the event and as I think the
slimes removed actually when the

415
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,010
actually given

416
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,310
we can still find a presentation on
lines quite funny and SES

417
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:29,510
the caller is to inculcate adopt a
vehicle make type design methods

418
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:35,230
such that they become I'm pervasive in
some subsequent generations of Engineers

419
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,159
so busy is the goal for darpa is
inculcated military design was not

420
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:40,940
methodology

421
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,340
um it high standards me interject yeah
even

422
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,139
saying a bunch in interesting points
there's probably other people while

423
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:52,260
say it's a sci tech even when is yeah I
think every contract is different and

424
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:52,710
one

425
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:56,899
aspect of our contract is that we won't
be able to collect names

426
00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:01,040
and I'm I think that touches on the
recruiting aspect and

427
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,320
you know that's not me. innings involves
though

428
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,010
yeah I was talking to a jury is still
really are with siddig and he mentioned

429
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,530
that their specific clauses about
recruiting not being allowed and I think

430
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,120
that ties back into the legality
arguments

431
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,600
they recognize that the the benefit here
is in the stem initiatives as you're

432
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,630
discussing it with

433
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,330
the the implementing that that
engineering or

434
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,699
approach in design approach for kids is
more important to them than the

435
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,929
recruitment because down the line

436
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:31,740
dark but doesn't generally bring in
engineering town what they do is they

437
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,850
reach out to a company like Raytheon RC
ASEAN they say hey we need you to build

438
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,590
something for the

439
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:40,919
for us would like to bid on the contract
so the reality is many other kids who

440
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,980
would benefit from the darpa stem
initiatives

441
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,909
are going to be recruited into the
military what they're gonna be doing is

442
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:49,110
using it they're gonna go and get a job
with the defense contractor

443
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,120
or maybe with Intel maybe with

444
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,600
you know some cooking manufacturing
helping you never know

445
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,659
but the I think that there is a tease

446
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:01,820
you're now at odds with yourself on
their mission statement i'd

447
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,090
don't think that they can actively
recruit well-being in education

448
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:11,419
education initiative because in laws
around recruiting in schools

449
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:15,110
and to his first hit the quarter copters
an unmanned

450
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,850
vehicles in general those are some of
the best puzzles out there

451
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:24,649
and I I like quad copters I I would much
prefer that we also learned that because

452
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:25,830
it exists now

453
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,889
we can't just ignore it and it'll go
away it's not like your ex

454
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:33,610
or what we hope happens at you um

455
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:38,169
I I had a very nice quite a copper
deliver me beer the other day like we

456
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:40,620
could we can do amazing things with this

457
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,790
and so I and also bit

458
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:49,290
that is already at this state that it is
state-of-the-art millions

459
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,940
introducing schoolchildren to how to
builds

460
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,880
robots is not going to help the military
right now

461
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,480
like a I know that and and as far as
their their methodology

462
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,260
they get shit done but we need more
rigor

463
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,320
in what we do we need more documentation
I'd

464
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,620
well I don't agree with inundating

465
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:18,620
the ethics a bit I to agree with getting
more of those values and just process

466
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:24,408
I think that's good you think it's
possible to separate those

467
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,870
I think if we have enough conversations
around it and continue calling each

468
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,360
other out on what is ethical and what is
not

469
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,240
I think it's definitely possible to
separate those things now

470
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,590
say from a military standpoint a you
look at

471
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,940
aligns older on what they're taught is
they have to you

472
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,800
obey the chain of command when you join
the United States military you're given

473
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,020
a gun you're pointed

474
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,690
in a direction you're told that you're
allowed to shoot certain people you're

475
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,350
not allowed to shoot certain people

476
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,399
there's something a suspension morality
that occurs there

477
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:58,580
you're allowing somebody the opportunity

478
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,210
it will not even obtain their being told
that it's OK and you should

479
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,320
you're now a hero you should go out and
kill people

480
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,178
it's something that nobody wants to do
no one wakes up in the morning and wants

481
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:09,540
to go out and shoot someone

482
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,908
in fact many soldiers fire high when the
first art

483
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:15,970
combat reality is is that the way

484
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:20,330
the military exist today is that the
people running around in the field

485
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,970
have suspended their morality and
they're following commands

486
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:28,409
I'll regulations on what they're allowed
to shoot a when their large you

487
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:31,440
and they're expecting their leadership

488
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,530
and their elected representatives to
provide guidance

489
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:38,500
in what is ethical what is right and
sold I would say that

490
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,210
to a certain extent you do have to
recognize that some other process

491
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,050
that exists inside logistics of the
night its military

492
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,050
is built around that mechanism

493
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,649
and yes some it's probably difficult to
disassociate

494
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:57,149
those at those chains of command are
starting to be flattened

495
00:28:57,149 --> 00:29:01,889
in some ways though where now ir it's
not quite to the individual yet but

496
00:29:01,889 --> 00:29:03,990
they're working on it moving

497
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,429
where it's just here is your objective

498
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:10,940
the unit figures out how to do it on and

499
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:15,349
I I know that the military does some
horrible things that are unacceptable on

500
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:17,240
that high is very deeply to

501
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,490
one our politicians think are the best
routes and

502
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,950
with again take on some responsibility
figure out how to interact with that

503
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:30,030
or how do actively tear it down on

504
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:35,020
but it it's moving away from that and
dad adaptation is also going to allow

505
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:41,429
II disaster response to happen in a much
more effective way

506
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:45,550
most of the time people will try to Sol

507
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,280
which is a falls word situation without
harming anyone

508
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,889
on

509
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:56,030
now will me um

510
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,330
go off %uh a little bit different
directions so um

511
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:03,490
one of the things I'd totally love about
arm

512
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:07,879
this whole seen the hacker movement as I
see it

513
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:14,460
arm and Maker Faires is people are doing
what they're doing because they love it

514
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,099
whether or not it makes money and that's
when the reasons that

515
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,918
it was such an incredibly high
experience from you the first time I

516
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,230
went to Maker Faire

517
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,440
they were 20,000

518
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,879
introverted geeks all wanting to share
in 20 sickly the projects that they love

519
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:35,510
and learn from other people doing the
same I'll

520
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:39,349
you know like her lists what makes this
place

521
00:30:39,349 --> 00:30:44,490
know your 2001 close as friends all
sharing what they love

522
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,260
um money can change that

523
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,540
arm here we live in you know we're
surrounded by

524
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,730
the United States where and the rest of
the world our modern world it seems to

525
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,690
be more and more about money

526
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,340
and anything else even if money doesn't
particularly make people happy

527
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,020
so um owners you can address that so in
the

528
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,560
I'll particular the grants for

529
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,678
well the Maker Faire its ten million
dollars is my understanding

530
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,800
are to be given possibly over a period
of years renewable

531
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,869
each year what are people willing to do
or not do you in order to make that

532
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:26,419
finding more likely in does that change
things

533
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:30,010
so that was kinda leading question but
you know seriously

534
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:34,330
what do you what do you think of all
that I think the HSP

535
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:37,530
program is prepared for a wild ride here

536
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,470
ands actors please hackerspace space
program

537
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,679
and IOM

538
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:48,669
yeah I just hope that we're gonna see
some

539
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:52,020
amazing awesome innovation

540
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,899
and inventions and and and things come
out of it by

541
00:31:55,899 --> 00:32:02,810
I don't know it's gonna be a wild ride
home

542
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,750
tonight

543
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,260
on I will see that Grant initiatives

544
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,490
are something that many hackers bases
have looked into on

545
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,590
I know many hackers bases have attempted
to get grants and if you've ever gotten

546
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,810
a grant or work in research you know
that getting your first grant is the

547
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,440
hardest

548
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,040
if you have no back history or no one on
your board that's

549
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,389
had or worked in large transport more
you're almost immediately shot down

550
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:30,750
so the dark or proposals that are coming
into hackerspace is

551
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,090
are providing an avenue for future
Graham money to come

552
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,180
into hackerspace is providing greater
legitimacy

553
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,470
and a capacity for her your local
hackerspace to reach out to you

554
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:45,880
local community colleges and local
government on a more equal footing

555
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,430
I think there's certainly a huge amount
love benefit outside have just

556
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,860
the monetary value ten million dollars
is not that much on a national scale

557
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,100
its affectively being able to give like

558
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,920
a penny to every kid in the planar in
the country it's it's not much

559
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,250
cell I think the real benefits are in
the future

560
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,010
Sep

561
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:13,060
how many people here pay dues to a
hackerspace

562
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,270
okay how many do it with any regularity

563
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,720
okay so

564
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,530
as someone who has had to make sure that
the bills can get paid

565
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,830
on it's really stressful

566
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:32,610
especially because the hackerspace and I
found an echo founded

567
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,720
was not backed by wealthy people

568
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,120
I'm we didn't have someone who could
swoop in

569
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,490
if we couldn't make rent and just pay it
an

570
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,690
and if we really want to make it happen
we had to figure out how

571
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:51,460
and this high is very much into just
general maintenance and things that goes

572
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,220
to the cleaning up after yourself

573
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:58,610
it goes to the amount the social
responsibility that you take on

574
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,900
that includes taking out the trash
sometimes

575
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,090
and doing the dishes not just your own
but also the extra cup that was left

576
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:06,660
there

577
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:10,668
on that allows things to continue in a
sustainable fashion

578
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:15,889
an and sometimes looking in a very large
chunk of money and seeing that you could

579
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,029
just focus on the things that you love

580
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:21,100
for a while and see them come to full
fruition

581
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,409
is incredibly incredibly a learning

582
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:28,540
and so overall able to contribute a
little bit more

583
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,980
consistently these were two things are

584
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:38,060
are are less alluring yeah actually hit

585
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,320
can explore ways to its one of my
biggest disappointments actually with

586
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,190
the doctor makes thing was I really
didn't

587
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,460
feel a Tim Riley and make had to go to
darpa for ten million dollars

588
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,870
that's not a lot of money and I really
do believe that was put like

589
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,279
it's Tim Riley for god sake if the guy
wants ten million dollars I'm pretty

590
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,690
sure people be more than willing

591
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:58,800
to you know do not form a team could be
done

592
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,070
and you'd have base Lena love these
issues at all I think will win vinny

593
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:07,660
I don't be on kinds you're not trying to
women you talk about government feeding

594
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,450
I think that might be a little lil again
you can never tell ball

595
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:15,819
I get the feeling of me might be kind of
why that route was taken off

596
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:19,360
we can get 10 million would get 10 we
can get a lot more for something similar

597
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:19,980
or

598
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,360
whatever on

599
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,120
I think it's important that this
community remembers that went make is

600
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,290
not in the business

601
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,900
helping her community they're in the
business of helping every community

602
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,440
and getting out beyond this community
means getting big names involved

603
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,410
that everyone can be aware of and have
some level of respect for

604
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:44,850
better for better for worse darpa is a
big name they are well respected

605
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,450
throughout

606
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,279
academia and against a large
corporations so I think that is where

607
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,780
the fundamental value was

608
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:55,070
beyond just the money down

609
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,320
so on arm no one really

610
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:04,150
address the point hours trying or attend
attempting to make about Tom

611
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:08,220
you know does the does the money

612
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:12,320
change what people are willing to do or
not to do in order to get more money

613
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,380
than

614
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,910
in that way it becomes less power

615
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:20,259
doing what we love that's that's one of
the things that

616
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,420
worries me arm do you have concerns like
that or does that

617
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,650
like a is that just like my point of
view you have a different one what

618
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:33,100
to anyone that's sorta like what I
mentioned before about like

619
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,520
about Google giving 20 percent above

620
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,880
like your own times do whatever you want
however it ends up being like Google

621
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,780
stuff

622
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:47,450
so I feel like this darpa money is gonna
end up being liked are pissed off

623
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:52,450
so I think it absolutely depends on the
person

624
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,930
on there are people out there who see
the value in money

625
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,169
her fun yes i speaking now okay

626
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,810
and yeah I'm

627
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:06,220
met I'm trying um so

628
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,560
but for someone like me I've been poor
for most of my life

629
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,529
pretty incredibly poor especially if we
were to look at the demographics in this

630
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,170
room

631
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:18,180
because no one could pay me enough to
not do what I love

632
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:22,450
going to take time out of my day to go
into something else on

633
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:27,330
so when people have offered money for
things that I didn't care about

634
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,610
I'm finding a Roman that's cool

635
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:35,940
there are other people who don't want to
do that on who

636
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,510
see other ways is at having a thrilling
life

637
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:44,510
so absolute depend on individual and and
the group

638
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:47,630
I think the way it did I see it is it's
a difference

639
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:51,210
seen you looking at like one homeless
guy walking in street then going

640
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:55,060
I'm gonna help this guy out his name's
Ted he wants get a hamburger I'm so damn

641
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,470
by dinner for

642
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:00,080
and being the guy who says I'm gonna
help all homes in the city

643
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:05,770
which means I can't help ted cuz ted's
no longer a person he's a number

644
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:09,070
I think when something becomes a
business or becomes a ten million dollar

645
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,350
grant project

646
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:14,560
it stops being very personal becomes I
have to go by the numbers after

647
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,210
reach the group level efficiency I have
to start doing this in an analytical

648
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,300
fashion

649
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,070
I have to suspend the absolute morality

650
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:27,110
and make it about the ends justify the
means to a certain extent

651
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,470
and I think that there is a definite
switch in most people to

652
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,550
what extent they choose to go in either
direction I think

653
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:37,120
that's probably what I would say is the
difference

654
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,759
yeah actually is come that free mercies
exactly put it like this is that use

655
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,540
problem right

656
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,730
of you know you have a your your life be
like exist in a community

657
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:50,530
but you might be one librarian you know
a system 40

658
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,510
were now you have to answer to reduce
systems are different US an oriole very

659
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,950
but you may have to answer to your
municipality in border what you do

660
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,160
so it no longer becomes normal go to a
library and the people in the lobby will

661
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,000
know every single person that comes in

662
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,830
bought at the end the day after skewl
Sunday come in for a program will never

663
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,980
not least because it's gone

664
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,790
in the sri Manuel you know how
passionate librarians are available how

665
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,940
important it is

666
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,590
so yet does have a huge impact to that
ties into mean

667
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:21,050
why it's important that your spaces be
community-based

668
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:24,630
because then it's the members who decide
how it goes

669
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:27,900
on if the library were supported by the
individuals who are part of it

670
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,980
then they have much Marseille which is
good and bad rate sometimes you have

671
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,010
a community with a really awful
viewpoint Saint Mary's High him and that

672
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,730
the hackerspace panel that

673
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:42,520
nationalist the didn't want to go to the
third hacker space in the city because

674
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,870
they were right next to the LGBT
community and then

675
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:49,730
on did Center a culture

676
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,550
because they don't wanna be near those
people we don't want those people in our

677
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,060
community we don't want them to

678
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,290
to have a space at least I don't I don't
think they deserve one

679
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,620
on the hunt play

680
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:05,540
so that balance love having someone

681
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:09,670
yes I think you'll get what I'm saying
okay his plea interest in that the only

682
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,610
reason to lie breeze function way to do
it because the

683
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:17,090
in general all librarians agreed to a
celeb Essex star laid down by

684
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:20,610
Alaa on Terry lightly salted just apply
to are not binding

685
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,750
it's completely voluntary for you and so
all library

686
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:27,660
now you know again has laws you know
that lotteries have to be completely

687
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,540
neutral rar like legal aspects
especially kinda

688
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,200
am bought two things that doesn't map on
Tiger spaces

689
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,590
at all I'm so you know I've had terrible
experienced hiker space is an amazingly

690
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,840
wonderful ones

691
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,480
um so even though it might be yes it is
a community

692
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,420
because there's no overarching ethics in
the space itself

693
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,600
that is like written down we all agree
like things about sex race and gender

694
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,470
you know if you make sex is Joe you know
if you make jokes about sexual assault

695
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,690
you will be kicked outta space I just
because somebody something sometimes

696
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:02,000
actually and so goes the BB certainly if

697
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,750
if hyperspace were looking for a model
to look to libraries had actually handle

698
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,910
issues around

699
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:11,279
neutrality and he's a really good one to
look up we've been doing it for so long

700
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,980
I think there was an excellent point
that the money is this going to be

701
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,330
distributed in and everyone's can become
numbers

702
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:21,890
and I think their responsibility of the
programs at the hackerspace

703
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:26,020
should be to bring it back down to
personal level and treaties projects

704
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,090
a individually and arm

705
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:32,440
I also personally don't want to see
these being

706
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,440
tainted in the top attraction I want
them to be

707
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,580
moving towards innovation and and
actually

708
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,090
not offense then now touched my personal

709
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:45,490
opinion now so lemme were from

710
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:49,410
begun like 10 minutes left so I was
thinking you'd be cool for

711
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,940
people in the audience you have
questions to ask and I'll

712
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,940
lineup for maybe a couple questions

713
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,330
those questions that I hope might be
curious

714
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:04,259
ends be nice to each other know what you
think hurt nobody out there

715
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:09,090
also be succinct in your questions or
comments and we'll try to do the same

716
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:12,170
school cold

717
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:16,240
florid home things a panel very
insightful

718
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,690
um sorely the problems

719
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:23,170
receiving funding ethically not new so
these

720
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:26,220
organizations 501 c3 is on that

721
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,720
decide that the only and receive money
in amounts that don't make beholden to

722
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,900
the organization giving them money

723
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,530
on so I was sort of wondering if you
could possibly speak to something like

724
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:35,790
that when receiving funding from

725
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:39,910
something like da but to me anyone wanna

726
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:44,649
are my thing where are we actually do
have to have a non-profit

727
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:47,810
are set up to collect the money for the
tarp

728
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:52,700
I have to say space program I would say
I would like to see more the space is

729
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,000
discussing things like that and actually
providing some analytical feedback I'd

730
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,310
like to see it like a real

731
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:01,029
research paper written on that show me
the numbers I'm I've never seen any

732
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:04,950
I would like to see that every project
that receives money

733
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:09,460
by included not just padding but also in
endpoint

734
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,920
so that it's not based on continuation
of funding

735
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,800
so that they don't have to keep going
back to see the end of it

736
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:23,160
but it it's done at the end thanks

737
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:28,220
home year have been thinking about this
issue for a little while I'm

738
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,420
19b that succinct sorry a I

739
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,610
um I work for a company that

740
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:40,180
contracts the USGS mostly the earthquake
monitoring software we were doing

741
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:44,120
some work a.m. there was going to be
some work

742
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,819
for geothermal laundering some and

743
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:51,370
it was going to be at China Lake and it
was going to be

744
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:56,040
at the navy and I wouldn't do it my so
they didn't want to do

745
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,779
that work and my left liberal colleagues
got

746
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,620
really angry at me they were like look
yet to see its do thermal

747
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:07,130
it's good it's the only way this
technology is gonna get

748
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:11,980
out there its gonna if we don't advances
here the military has the money to make

749
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,780
this happen

750
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:17,350
and you know that it's not gonna happen
otherwise here's your chance

751
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:21,589
to make something really good happened
who cares who's paying the bills this is

752
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:22,120
a good

753
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,600
thing and I guess I come from the
interview where

754
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,780
you know you look at the website for
what darpa stands for

755
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,860
it specifically is for defense and

756
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,830
killing people and I don't want to do
that but how much will I do

757
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:40,840
well I'll be a little piece %uh that

758
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,040
maybe or not arm you know

759
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:48,290
a like kill people know will I makes
software that might kill people

760
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,300
/url no but will or will it just helped
this

761
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,800
you know it's a geothermal plant it's
just energy you know and and we vote

762
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,050
with our taxes

763
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:02,410
for the military the and the we have
more control may be over the military

764
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,779
than we do over corporations because
we've

765
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:08,530
you know the government says something
about what the military does

766
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:12,350
so a guess and I

767
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:16,230
all that is all that is a

768
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,300
just running around in my head and it's
and I'm always

769
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,450
lies in dumb figure out where you can go
with it yet the point I think you're

770
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:25,400
making is one I thought have to use like
where do you draw the line

771
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,630
all of us in this room probably pay some
taxes or have

772
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,910
at some point in our lives that means
workers in some ways

773
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:36,279
supporting are things that we don't
agree with arm

774
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,540
will you go out in build nuclear weapons
that are targeted to civilians

775
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:44,680
probably no one in this room will do
that will you work on a program that

776
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,020
lol at work on some a create something
that might be used by the military

777
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,490
you know there's all these gradations
like you're saying

778
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:56,070
so where do you draw the line in arm on
be 10

779
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:59,270
just that um I would like to say this

780
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:02,690
um technology is inherently the

781
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:06,080
it's something that increases our
capabilities and what we use

782
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,299
individually are capable

783
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,120
love is great this or great evil

784
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,880
on it's like spider-man you know with
great power comes great responsibility

785
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,850
but it's not just for me it's also for
all the viewers my opens or something

786
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:21,130
every now have to trust every single
person this room

787
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:24,440
obviously we're not all nice people
there's a guy outside he was running

788
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:24,810
around

789
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:27,950
you know Sean I'm showing my cock to
people five minutes ago

790
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:34,070
um reality is you have to have a
fundamental faith in the decency of

791
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:35,820
mankind to be an engineering

792
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:39,410
you have to be able to say that I
believe that my technology is not going

793
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:39,950
to be

794
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:43,650
by and large used to do horrible things
otherwise you're just gonna end up like

795
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:46,400
the unibomber living in a shack sending
bombs to people who work in computer

796
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,750
science because

797
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:51,150
the reality is technologies can keep
advancing its keep to keep getting more

798
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:53,640
and more dangerous and you have to
believe in the ass

799
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:58,020
otherwise may as well just hide your
hand the whole

800
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,620
technology just like any other tool will
only extrapolate

801
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,810
human Italy human ability and intent

802
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:08,870
and we can build things that get out of
the way and people being good

803
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:12,230
good being relative terms exchange on

804
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:15,870
or and we can also build things that
make it difficult to

805
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:20,130
to be awful on but it's going to change
and as

806
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:24,180
my dear friend kevin says any tools a
weapon if you hold it right

807
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:28,700
including language it's all gray area

808
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,550
I actually about yet there's actually a
ordeal or call as well that you

809
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,350
lemasters tools will never dismantle a
master's house

810
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:38,460
and I'm i think is kind of a danger
sometimes especially with the

811
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:42,400
darpa make die it is you know it could
be perceived as this is just a master's

812
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,320
tools trying to smuggle a master's house
at this very much

813
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,300
could be perceived as business as usual
and so I think justice and that are

814
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,550
just another way of looking at it again

815
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:56,420
there lotsa sources of money all of them
are corrupt urs

816
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:59,540
it could be darpa it could be DHS

817
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:02,730
BNSF any which way your hand up be

818
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:06,420
could be some rich person on your board
for the nonprofit

819
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,490
no matter what happens you'll find
yourself in the position of conflict

820
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:11,170
where you might be beholden

821
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:15,000
to those people who pay your money and I
agree with the first speaker

822
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,710
whose suggests that the extent to which
you find yourself colton is the key

823
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:19,600
question

824
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,720
whether to accept money or not

825
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,480
iPhone perhaps the if you agree with the
funder

826
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,580
fundamentally or not as well but

827
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:34,870
sorry I I think um some sources of
funding can also be enable there's

828
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,029
either like you know crowdfunding

829
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:41,710
so Jerry so did Jerry

830
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,980
as a founder of Maui makers base and
what you created the

831
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:49,170
hackerspace space program no I got

832
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:53,190
my name put on the as leave the acker
species program because I to dark

833
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:54,270
background

834
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:57,990
mostly people who put in the program %uh
the proposal

835
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:02,350
were not US people there are only three
US citizens in in it is intended to be

836
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:04,270
an international program

837
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:08,180
on but aside from HSP a warning to
mention that there is

838
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:12,049
a in SF proposal program that's been
announced

839
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:16,350
to study a project-based learning

840
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:20,670
a multi-year thing for several different
tracks with several million dollars

841
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:24,500
involved people who don't want to take
TARP money they're willing to take in SF

842
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,140
money

843
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,250
to go chase that and make it happen and
its

844
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:32,230
its written for makers faces hackerspace
so we need to get some people involved

845
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,090
in doing that from this Community

846
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,200
and not just the academia see this man

847
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,360
if you have any idea I down tell me
about that 1 I'll tell you about that

848
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,320
also talked about it is P

849
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,500
um but one of the things I want to
mention about both ages P and the make

850
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,590
a effort is

851
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:52,910
you had mentioned the military
suspension

852
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:58,819
ethics morality in passing it off to the
higher ups and politicians and so forth

853
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:02,750
it's the oversight that makes the
direction that happens the people

854
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:06,360
at me are very ethical they have their
very strong believes

855
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,730
in bringing up people and making all
this the education

856
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:15,090
it's the people here the need to be
involved in those programs

857
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:19,370
in our program to keep it ethical keep
it moving in the direction you want to

858
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,720
say to

859
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,790
our mission up the ages ps2

860
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:27,840
enhance humanities survivability there's
nothing in it about military

861
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,620
it has to do with humanity and surviving
everything keep us moving in that

862
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,160
direction get involved get involved in
the local makers face

863
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,009
and keep them moving along and call out
the recruiters may show up because

864
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:40,820
that's illegal for them to be there

865
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:44,550
it's against their contract to be there
thank you would like to see

866
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:48,460
Thomas Aquinas once famously said
silence is consent

867
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:52,140
and that's kinda beads on is also go
further you know communication of months

868
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:55,140
communications the only way we keep
ourselves from

869
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,150
being ignorant towards each other I

870
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:02,710
one of the reasons I think we're even
having this debate is because

871
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:06,390
all the other organizations that use to
be able to get

872
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:09,990
grants from and support from have been
stripped

873
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:13,700
up everything on and that's a cultural
issue

874
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,320
to cultural issue have people not being
willing to pay taxes are not saying that

875
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,280
as a whale's

876
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,780
up making that happen on and week

877
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:25,250
we've been silent that entire time and

878
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:29,330
at the at the last panel there was some
talking about how hackers bases are

879
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:33,170
intrinsically political and how we don't
see them that way in america

880
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:37,290
and I think that's because with we
haven't been paying attention

881
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:41,600
we absolutely need him

882
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:46,380
on it seems to me that as long as you're
not going after the money

883
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:50,570
you can actually use this Wed use
getting funding as a method of some

884
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:51,030
burning

885
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:54,580
things because you are already wants you

886
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:58,610
build these classrooms and spread this
education and it doctor signing at that

887
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,910
means they now camp that those funds
towards making boats that exploded

888
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,480
mid-air so that the more damage

889
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,400
it someone once and recruiters to that
well they've already have those

890
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,380
recruiters

891
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,030
and now they can send them somewhere
else and now that the share space with

892
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,410
someone who is going to be

893
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:14,620
trying to instill more ethics and
someone is going to try and

894
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,680
mitigate thats on

895
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,510
which decrease their effectiveness so

896
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:24,630
could that be make my ago

897
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:28,650
everyone here's how to do this and it's
it's unfortunately not as easy is all

898
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:29,270
about but

899
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:34,090
I want in my opinions while it said love
to see a soldier building a house about

900
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:37,570
them you know blowing up any given day
that we can I think that's true of most

901
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:40,390
people

902
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:45,549
sue away yes I totally agree with you
but I also agree with

903
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:50,380
d concerns that matches express in that
than those funds are tainted and then

904
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:54,080
I the community here that the group
giving those funds is seen as

905
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,060
legitimized

906
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:01,880
and also they have a I'll a budget this
year 3.2 billion dollars and it can be

907
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,170
increased in a second

908
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:07,100
I would like to point out the TSA
budgets about 20 knowledge about forty

909
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:07,710
billion

910
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:12,560
nasa budgets about money and I i think
thats the order lot more as a good one

911
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,680
to remember to masters tools will never
dismantle a master's house

912
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,840
um I think you also be very very careful

913
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:23,500
precisely put some serious soul into
exactly what the angles are

914
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:29,690
and what this can lead to no matter what
benefit you might see at the time

915
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:34,350
harlem I think it's a lesson plan that
organ donor

916
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:37,779
we have time more questions from

917
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,810
more occurs for this is the last
question arm

918
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:44,930
so on education arm you know I totally
agree that

919
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:49,460
classrooms anymore soldering irons and
seen CNC machines and

920
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:54,720
York Sarah and Dom when I'm kinda
worried about is that

921
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,400
while the kids they're gonna go you know
is great you know engineering problem

922
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,130
solving skills but not

923
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:04,130
critical thinking skills and

924
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:08,100
career sponsor ideas I'll this

925
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:13,370
only take this one oh man okay so I

926
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:16,170
the last few years I've been a part of
something on school factory in space

927
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:16,880
Federation

928
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,790
and hear about hackers basis becomes
schools in the future you might be able

929
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:22,120
to tell from some things I said earlier

930
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:27,819
and even just putting shop class is back
in schools is not going to solve the

931
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:28,510
problem

932
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:32,400
on because you use a drill press does
not mean you suddenly have the ability

933
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:32,920
to

934
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,280
to even build chair on

935
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,510
still for me its awesome because
suddenly

936
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:44,110
people have access to tools and
equipment and hopefully say

937
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:48,940
allowing this other person came in from
apparently do this outside a school and

938
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:52,340
kinda like being in schools all go hang
out there instead

939
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:56,290
on i care about. corrupting mom and
pulling them out at that system because

940
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:59,810
the education system is just as broken
as our military system

941
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:03,830
on perhaps more dangerously so

942
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:07,279
actually and

943
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,030
yes does that answer your question here

944
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:14,230
as okay

945
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:17,630
up for the most part I'd like to say I
think that's absolutely true

946
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:21,210
more kids need to be brought up in a a
stronger

947
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:24,510
stem environment but I think that the
real problem there's is you have to

948
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:25,730
reach out to the parents as well

949
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:29,110
I think actor spaces in communities in
the ways to do that

950
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:33,170
so I think tarp was writen getting
hackerspace is involved

951
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:37,640
it's a person to person thing

952
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,990
I think we should definitely in still
critical thinking in the educational

953
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:43,270
programs

954
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:46,550
yes please please come invade library
and

955
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:50,980
if you have five minutes during the week
and we have space we sometimes have

956
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:51,470
money

957
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:55,460
allegedly and and if you know we are
busy all the critical thinking and

958
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:58,440
really if you want a truly neutral space

959
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,620
to do hacker stuff libros pretty much a
if you wanna

960
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:07,310
hear about what they did in Texas thank
you can even bring up critical thinking

961
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:09,090
in any class because it might

962
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:12,590
undermined at the believes the that
parents are trying to instill in their

963
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:13,750
children

964
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:18,780
the its of all the problems with the
education system are many and huge

965
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:22,330
and perhaps insurmountable in this is
one of the great reasons why hackers

966
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:26,380
bases are flourishing our country
because it fills a move that horrible

967
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:30,300
avoid arm so I hope this panel has been

968
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:34,650
I informative for people in seeing that
these issues reveal her important to

969
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:35,490
think through

970
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:40,410
because this affects the future I love
us individually and collectively as a

971
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:41,440
community

972
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,900
and the whole hackers basement so arm

973
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,490
and there's no rights in wrong so please
keep

974
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:53,100
keep talking about this and now let's
see where we are in a in a few years as

975
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:58,670
a result of the thinking and talking in
discussion our community in the future

976
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:05,670
%ah

977
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:12,240
worse
