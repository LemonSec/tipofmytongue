13
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,010
Spain Sri Lanka Brewer contacted mister

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,160
a while ago and proposed to do this

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,750
I think a really necessary talk about on
media coverage

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,340
hackers which and I'm sure my neighbors
have it for going back decades reading

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,000
some these

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,230
crazy stories about hackers did this or
that i personal experience with

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,560
on mainstream media reporting just
wildly inaccurate things

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,030
and its and the problem that we can all

21
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,590
play a part in trying to fix and it but
it's important understand how the

22
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,590
problem happens

23
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,680
on and why it happens

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,520
and us pagers gonna go into something
that some other things and getting

25
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:22,960

times now this is probably one of the

31
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,110
best ones I've seen

32
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,439
so far well it's actually on time which
is a big

33
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:56,270
bigger a big plus I think II's so
hackers a media I big tax it never

34
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,130
really happened

35
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,729
what's up okay this is going to work now

36

then

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,220
I never really use my real name so you
have my real name now

50
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,319
I've been known space rock last 20 years
or so

51
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,450
as a member of of heavy industries if
anybody remembers who the hell they were

52
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,290
I thank you I created the black Mac
archives

53
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,379
I just by the congress we computer
security government I was editor of the

54
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:10,179
Hacker News Network not once but twice

55
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,959
I try and tell his manager trust was by
robs what I do now

56
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,690
so up I spoke duck on source but places

57
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,230
I've been sorted do in media stuff for a
very long time

58
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,150
without really knowing I was doing media
stuff as party running the Hacker News

59
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,580
Network you run a possible

60
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,040
o'clock you talked this morning had too
much to drink last name

61
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,829
you 1 o'clock across a lot of news
stories

62
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,760
com they don't make any sense and its
worldwide stock is here

63
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,329
on what we're going to talk about the
days we'll talk about contract define

64
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,760
what media hype really is

65
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,720
I'm gonna go over quite a few examples
on

66
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,830
and then we're gonna talk about how to
identify hype so you can

67
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,739
sorta most people think they I think I
have a pretty good idea of all this is

68
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:01,220
we too high will try going to some
concrete step so you can identify that

69
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,980
and how to be a part of the reality
allowed a stalker breakup I break up

70
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,739
into the hype

71
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:09,799
and a break it up into the reality
there's a lot more hype out there that

72
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:11,000
doesn't match the reality

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,769
and so i've only included stories that I
could actually

74
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:18,880
find a reality to hear examples so what
is media hype

75
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,229
media any means of communication
basically

76
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,430
are your television newspaper magazines
that reach

77
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,280
or in bones people widely I think that's
an important distinction

78
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,930
I and hype the number three definition
is probably the best to intensified by

79
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,650
ingenious

80
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,410
or questionable claims or methods right
so you add those together we get media

81
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,620
hype and we're gonna

82
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,770
apply that to I Packers today

83
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,840
night couple notes and examples in to
give your

84
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,900
they're not really presented any sort of
order

85
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,910
on their sewer chronological but not
really

86
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,009
the although the story is the harder it
has been to research

87
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,780
stuff on the web guys very very quickly
ass teases got his eyes talked yesterday

88
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,470
Hill back that up it's very very hard to
find

89
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,500
historical references especially reality
because the hype lives forever right

90
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,060
the reality dies a very quick to I'm

91
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,380
this sort of stories happen every single
day I could probably find one example

92
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,710
related information security or hackers
and every

93
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,690
news cycle but you can't always

94
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,410
find out the reality like you know
there's hype in there but you don't know

95
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,270
exactly how bad it is or how good it is

96
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,310
but I could buy an example every day so
if you think these are isolated they're

97
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,789
not

98
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:43,340
alright I don't have any journalist
corner in the audience

99
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,090
apologize in advance to you if your
reporter and unions and I don't really

100
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,919
care

101
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:52,479
I define reporter and journalist has two
totally separate different things

102
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,050
okay arm journalists should know better
now if you're one of the people in on

103
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,479
these examples

104
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,750
you should be should be I I'm not going
to cover the actor

105
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,139
theoretical attacks okay we've all heard
about ATM jackpot ng

106
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,400
you know attacking the wifi in your car
that sort of thing

107
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,050
and those things got a lotta media play
arm does not wanna talk about today

108
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,199
alright I am so let's go to our first
example kevin Mitnick year

109
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,870
now good let's talk about I am

110
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,449
so you probably have all heard the story
supposedly he had the capability of

111
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:29,050
whistling into a payphone

112
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,190
and launching nuclear missiles from
NORAD right

113
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,750
we all laugh at this now right back in
you know the eighties

114
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,130
this was like people took this is a
serious yet right

115
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,169
I am so empty without the quotes here
teenager use the computer to modem to

116
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:45,620
break into norad

117
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,400
foreshadowing the 1983 movie war games

118
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,539
mitnick as a teenager in California
infiltrated norad

119
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:56,190
computer system me the first received
national attention in 82

120
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,160
when he hacked in the north norad a few
inspired agree that inspired me to fill

121
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,270
war games

122
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,169
there's two things wrong with these
quotes 1 of course mitnick never broken

123
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:05,810
a NORAD

124
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,919
reich to he didn't inspire

125
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:12,650
war games war games inspired him and
we'll get to that alright

126
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,910
none did think that I kinda interesting
here and when I go to some as examples

127
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,550
if I forget to mention it make no

128
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,190
the dates the articles I the first one
hears 94

129
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,340
the second ones in 95 CNN is reporting
it in 99

130
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,979
okay

131
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:34,789
the reality was in ninety-six Katie
Hafner

132
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:39,940
I who was the have a human nose or
somewhere senior editor and Cooper the

133
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,639
cyberpunk

134
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,979
to see coach whose senior editor for
newsweek right

135
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,520
and ninety-six she went she went on the
record said she could find no evidence

136
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,400
that the norad story was anything but
men

137
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,349
I remember back in 1999 cNN is reporting
it has backed

138
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:00,349
not I emailed Kevin and I said hey dude
what's up with this whole moore-ede

139
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:01,280
story

140
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,110
and he totally ignore me then respond
probably cuz he won the Tour is Booker

141
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,930
that with him through bus

142
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,590
I am Leone white man who was a
prosecutor for his case

143
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,960
made when the most outrageous statements
that are probably ever been ordered by

144
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,780
federal prosecutor in court

145
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,460
he told the magistrate that I could
start a nuclear holocaust

146
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:23,110
he can whistle into a telephone and
launch nuclear missiles from NORAD

147
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,690
II I don't have an actual data when this
was com

148
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,370
but it was before it happened after

149
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,010
is this Court has happened after war
games came out

150
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,319
so it's highly likely that the
prosecutor sought a movie

151
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,490
and then attributed when he saw in the
movie to mitnick

152
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,169
as opposed to your way around where
mitnick was the inspiration for the

153
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,350
movie

154
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,899
so I in reality next example satellite
health parental

155
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:54,130
I come up with the the satellite stories
come about once every five to 10 years

156
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:59,950
I've seen like three of them so far on
this one's 1999

157
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,870
it was just crazy right there was a
small story in this newspaper called the

158
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,910
sunday business which is based in the UK
came out on a Sunday

159
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,420
sunday business writer I am and was
picked up by Reuters

160
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,279
hackers is Britain's military satellite
Britain's out military-style I held by

161
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,320
hackers crackers reportedly take Brit

162
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,570
British military satellite

163
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,680
the whole article was like four
paragraph long this is the whole article

164
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,339
right here

165
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:26,730
right and I don't you can actually meet
no small part but I'll

166
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,370
a quote some other toys parts for your
quoting security sources

167
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,019
altered the course the sources said said
one intelligence source

168
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:40,490
one security source said there's no name
sources here right

169
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,800
is it there's no way for anybody who's
reading this article to go back and

170
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,290
verify

171
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,790
what the hell happened there's no one
you can pick up the phone call

172
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,829
right to hate you know that you actually
get this quote is newspaper did

173
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,660
something did

174
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,730
satellite really taking over so this

175
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,850
this this occurred back when I was 18
and the first time not good news network

176
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,690
and I put up a big thing on it on the
site saying you know this is total crap

177
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,600
I totally

178
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,010
don't believe this happened arms makes
absolutely no sense

179
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,470
I and so Reuters eventually published a
retraction

180
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,070
bridged I'm after they published a
second-story

181
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,740
ZD net published a story as well up bud

182
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,480
I can also occur it took me days to find
these reality links

183
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,880
when I went to look for them and others
a lot more stories about the reality

184
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,980
part in the story

185
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,480
dan that I could find and just basic
example of how

186
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,730
reality just doesn't live on I could
find several

187
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,800
examples up the original story

188
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,470
but not a reality and a back in 2000

189
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,579
aid there was an article PC Mag

190
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,839
the 10 most mysterious cybercrime with
this particular

191
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,240
pack if you will was listed as number
two

192
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,240
it was the number two most mysterious
cybercrime

193
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,240
listed by this article PC Mag so I i saw
this

194
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,670
pc/mac story are kinda went a little ape
shit but and I looked up who wrote it is

195
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,729
guy by the name

196
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,560
your girl I guess I'm I Corey yo zo

197
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,930
wrote the story and I research to this
reporter was

198
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,490
basically he or she is in it as a
freelancer

199
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,540
and this is the only if a sec article
they've ever written

200
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,579
ever ike before this

201
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:25,070
ollie Britain was stuff about the
cheapest mp3 players

202
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,820
what's the best printer for your buck
right best bang for the buck creeper

203
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,450
and so if you look to the skies our bio
bio bibliography

204
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,130
he has your cheapest mp3 player best
printer I

205
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,610
no tamils mister cybercrimes negotiate
back to

206
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,430
keepers printer wanna I don't know how
you came up with these ten things

207
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,660
i said im several emails I sent the

208
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,860
I never got a response I sent emails to
the editor PC Mag any finally

209
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,300
put a blur but the topper their story or
something

210
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,889
but the story still up there I think the
link still works

211
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:02,209
I am know your

212
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:05,240
interesting interesting example netted

213
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,690
as we go through these do I also want to
point out look at some other sources

214
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,100
that I'm going sometimes I me forget the
sources

215
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,670
from particularly in this one the hyper
al Qaeda uses de canard feat

216
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,949
USA Today terror group hide behind
wedding Krypton

217
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,500
wired right bin Laden's name acts taking
our free master

218
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,089
and then cryptogram Bruce neier i
lubbers night a man's way smarter than I

219
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:27,720
am

220
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,959
but it this kinda goes to show that
sometimes

221
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,459
almost kinks or get taken in by the High
Park terrorist use

222
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:38,490
steganography I now because you don't
know steganography is it did

223
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,100
agent goes back to ancient greece I
basically

224
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,690
puts words inside pictures or other
media arms are you can't

225
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,440
disorder not really cryptid but it's
hidden

226
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,610
USA Today story quoted US officials and

227
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,870
experts and one guy for my defense

228
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,430
I am although that I defense guy sounds
like he's responding to hypothetical

229
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,329
questions you know if you read article

230
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:06,790
so I don't really know where the source
that this came from it doesn't make a

231
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,069
whole lot of sense to me

232
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,470
I member in 2001 everybody's freaking
out about errors while you sit still or

233
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,950
on and course territory using the
internet in and now they got stuck in

234
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,220
our

235
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,190
be oh my god the world's gonna end right
but the reality was

236
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,000
and I want to report these guys names
Center for Information Technology

237
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,860
Integration

238
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,920
neil's Provost and Peter Honeyman they
did the

239
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,430
report they were now and they downloaded
to million

240
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,079
images from the internet and scanning
all per second over

241
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:38,850
they found nothing I'm you think that if

242
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,070
if it was prolific at prolific as the
news articles making out

243
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,870
the Dooleys be one or two images that
had something in them

244
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,500
even if it wasn't a terrorist image

245
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,980
this was the realities and report the
report published in August 31st does one

246
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,170
now remember I should mention look at
the dates

247
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:02,850
cryptogram newsletter was september
thirtieth 2001 a month after the report

248
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,440
New Scientist reported in September 20
fair

249
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,019
this is the only article that the
reality got

250
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,399
as the only press at the reality got so
the hype got

251
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,130
lease these three right and probably a
dozen more

252
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:22,990
reality got to r1 writer

253
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,430
Saurabh reinforces the idea that you
know hype lives forever in reality dies

254
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,720
quick

255
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,120
but this story didn't die then it lived
on

256
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,570
and I don't understand this next part in
2012 in March this year

257
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,949
News reporter in Germany who claimed to
have seen documents

258
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:44,959
I indicating that al Qaeda had been
using

259
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,070
taken are to be inside a video right

260
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,279
and that those over a hundred documents
found in these in this video

261
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,519
the deal to detail all kinds of attacks
to ship to tax

262
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,720
you know I'm City Rampage is this error

263
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,130
but there's no source for the story the
only sources this reporter

264
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,250
and I use the term reporter who actually
saw the

265
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,350
documents he didn't have any government
sources he didn't pull any

266
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,730
anybody else years ago I saw these
documents and they were

267
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:16,589
they were you know the steganography al
Qaeda terrorists were gonna and by law

268
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:20,560
on CNN doesn't report on the story from
a month and a half later

269
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,110
I don't know why it took them so long I
was sounds like a pretty sensational

270
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,660
story which is right up CNN's Alan Duke

271
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,680
I am again when bin Laden was captured

272
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,970
he was captured with a lot of porn if
everybody remembers the

273
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,110
news reports right and you would think

274
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,620
that if they're using steganography that
the head guy in

275
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,300
and charged well kinda would have some
images

276
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,459
abuse porn was thinking are being right
but there was no reports that

277
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,949
it was any steganography found any was
born maybe that was it and make it in

278
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:51,610
the press

279
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,589
maybe this reporter found it and now
there's not enough information here did

280
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:55,930
too

281
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,690
did to determine what the hell actually
happened with through with reality what

282
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,029
is the hyper

283
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:05,490
are work

284
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:11,329
time another great story this one

285
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:15,769
II sixty minutes did a huge

286
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:18,829
story on this blackout that happened in
Brazil

287
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:24,490
right 60 minutes claims that they had a
half a dozen

288
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,269
sources in the military intelligence a
private security communities

289
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:31,769
now a lot of people complain about the
echo chamber in impulse act we're all

290
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:34,670
just got talking to ourselves right

291
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,300
if you want to see a bigger import echo
chamber go look at the intelligence

292
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:38,920
community

293
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,870
these guys do nothing but talk to
themselves I

294
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,829
60 minutes never named any their sources
but they claim they had happened does

295
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:47,829
not

296
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:51,389
and according to the the 60 minutes
report

297
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:54,560
the basically hackers broke into the
power company Brazil

298
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,560
and causes big massive blackout

299
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,600
so reality now remember

300
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,720
again look at the dates why first water
pours October 28

301
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,610
the 60 minutes report was November 8th
2009

302
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,809
and in I November 9

303
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:17,859
right 2009 wire reports that the
blackout was traced the city insulators

304
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:22,910
not hackers Brazil's independence:
system operator group later confirmed

305
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,010
that the value of the 345 kilovolt line
was provoked by pollution in the chain

306
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,500
insulators due to deposit or so

307
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,549
I mean it was so apparent that this is
what happened at the National Agencia

308
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:35,260
Brasil that regulate power companies

309
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,559
find his power company $327 million
dollars

310
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,799
pretty big fine I mean the binary hours
but from

311
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,000
it still even after this came out

312
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,470
CNN would not issue I mean does sixty
minutes would not issue a retraction

313
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,059
with a rock for their story about being
caused by hackers

314
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:58,289
because they stood by their half a dozen
I

315
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:02,549
sources in the intelligence community
now

316
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:07,090
I kinda got an idea how this would
happen probably one guy

317
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,418
was in a room with a bunch of other
folks and they're probably you know

318
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:14,010
having coffee in their donuts or
whatever are you a member that that

319
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,100
Brazil blackout

320
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,789
winner hackers did a and anyone net 20
hackers did do it

321
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:24,260
right and then I got reported repeated
and repeated and repeated

322
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,470
inside the echo chamber and then it got
leaked out the 60 minutes and 60 minutes

323
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,390
that by

324
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,360
in every even know you have this report
from the National Agency for electric

325
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,960
energy Brazil

326
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,200
60 minutes like now we have our sources
we're gonna stick by those

327
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,919
I'm I am i doing time willem

328
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,850
burning through the slides I am ahead
this next one kinda funny

329
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,039
and Twitter hacker something we know the
person who this guy was a weiner

330
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,390
I am Arab every member II

331
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,559
discussion New York I think
representative Weiner from

332
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:01,299
he evidently had some pictures naked
pictures of himself

333
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:04,590
posted to his Twitter account I and he

334
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,770
blame the actor right away right
computer hackers apparently get had

335
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,120
it's interesting to see the words that
these guys at their press uses on

336
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,490
stories like this

337
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,100
I am NBC a said

338
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,770
right away represented winners hacked
Twitter account right

339
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,470
Reuters says it's an alleged Twitter
hacking

340
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,120
and then having to pose is alleged to
Iraq to right

341
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,350
its interesting note that my Twitter
account was hacked

342
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:35,520
why Mike hiring a lawyer first you know
when I call the cops or something

343
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,240
on but no Weiner added had a good had to
hire a lawyer which kinda is the first

344
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,280
cup of it you know maybe this is a
really

345
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,280
a hacking incident so the reality was

346
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,549
the course a like three days later a

347
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:53,830
he publicly lied about a photo of
himself and over Twitter to a college

348
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,840
student in Seattle

349
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,990
I take full responsibility the pictures
of me and I sent it

350
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,789
so wasn't a hacker after all but I i put
this example in here

351
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:06,270
because one of many many examples
involving

352
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,299
these celebrities or quasi celebrities
especially and your social media

353
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,470
accounts right

354
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,799
Hayley Williams I claimed that she was
hacked charged with a topless picture

355
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,580
oversell

356
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,120
Paul Pierce the Boston Celtics he blamed
Packers effort we calling for broom

357
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,159
showed up in his words you Twitter
stream

358
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,490
I the blue the broom content of course
being in reference to

359
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,679
last week in Orlando Magic Jaipur gappy

360
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,860
the Washington Redskins I evidently
between users are paying tweet about his

361
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,370
wife

362
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,270
and other family members and then not
later said that his account was hacked

363
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,168
and it wasn't him after all

364
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:45,730
arm so this sort of thing happens a lot
people say things that didn't mean to

365
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,840
specially social media especially
celebrities

366
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,049
and they always hackers writer

367
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:57,580
I'm especially to watch TMZ seized a
result I'm

368
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,850
I'll snacks at another satellite actor
this would happen bill recently

369
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:06,049
I October 27 2011

370
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:10,309
Chinese military suspected in hacker
attacks on US satellites

371
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:14,350
preserve your stuff computer hackers
possibly much I possibly from the

372
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,080
chinese military interfered

373
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,260
but the fact is interviewed me with two
US government's allies four times in

374
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,330
2007-2008 to a ground station in Norway

375
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,860
according to congressional Commission
may have used an internet connection at

376
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,860
this I was bad

377
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,330
I can't process our satellite station
its Pittsburgh Norway

378
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,649
business week with a report on this they
represent a draft report from the

379
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:41,210
us-china economic and Security Review
Commission

380
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:46,640
your occurred writer on like this is a
big massive story this is important

381
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,240
if this actually happened why is this no
name agency reporting on it

382
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,640
that's my first question my second
question as I'm looking it was

383
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,179
interfered with me

384
00:21:55,179 --> 00:22:00,710
and how do you come up with me how like
don't have proof that happened in it

385
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,500
and then if you if you do a little
research even basic research into the

386
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,520
cells per satellite station is a
commercial station

387
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,929
right is not a government stations
commercial station the controls my

388
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:13,409
satellites as well probably all sources
in government

389
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:18,150
satellites as well but Obama commercial
entity and somebody blaming me

390
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,510
for being hacked I'm gonna come up and
say something one way or the other

391
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:26,299
right Mike no no we weren't or yeah we
were were taken steps to do it right

392
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:30,908
because rear either way is not good for
your business

393
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:34,620
but nobody's gonna put a satellite with
your station if you're getting hacked

394
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,669
all the time right

395
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:40,640
these guys had no comment whatsoever and
nobody bothered to call them and say

396
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,870
hey what the hell's going on what's up
with this report from the us-china

397
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,960
economic and Security Review Commission

398
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,409
you know that this really happen you
guys have any comment

399
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,210
business week never bothered to call
them at all in and get any car

400
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,659
confirmation whatsoever

401
00:22:55,659 --> 00:23:00,470
I'm and I've totally missed this but by
the time the us-china economic and

402
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,760
Security Review Commission

403
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,179
put this in the report the event was
suppose we three years old

404
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:11,280
I could happen three years before nobody
said anything about it

405
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,799
the reality is good outlook you've got a
business week right for you

406
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:21,320
but established media outlet reality
comes out in nasa watch a blog post

407
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,030
I nasa experience to suspicious events
houses

408
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,539
27 with the tear spacecraft in summer
fall 2008

409
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:31,799
there's no manipulation of data no
command successfully sent to the

410
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:32,340
satellite

411
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:36,918
and no data captured so what the fuck
happened right

412
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:40,659
and then of course tired than I did um
obviously and unfortunately because the

413
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:43,150
blame someone for so much stuff in it
tonight all

414
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,190
we really you can't really at or detract

415
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,610
based on what they say arm but is

416
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,809
interesting that they came up there then
I'll it so here we have the hype

417
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:57,270
right you we have the reality Arsenal
collapse

418
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,870
no idea next example though

419
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,490
we do know what happened with you think
we do do not water utility again it

420
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,460
really recent one

421
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,230
happened last november arm so basically

422
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:14,929
in in a small water by water utility
outside a Chicago

423
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:18,600
a pop fail and for some reason

424
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,029
they had to call in a home in security
your

425
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:25,220
my pump fails on holliman's here

426
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:31,000
I'll yeah I don't think they're gonna
sell fuck

427
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,090
make a big smile her prom attackers did
it

428
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:42,279
IOC so I think the best I love any the
media reports that I saw was because the

429
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:45,559
white one hackers 20 attack city water
station destroys barn

430
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:50,350
writer and again credit security fairly
reliable source right

431
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:54,140
cyber intrusion blame for hardware
failure water pump in these crabs put

432
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,150
the blame part in his title in
automatically assume

433
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,970
you know it was the bad guys have bad
guys being angry the interesting part

434
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,350
about this story is that

435
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:08,279
even in the hype right the the already
disproving our articles in the hype

436
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,770
they already know it didn't happen all
the way down to bottom of the article in

437
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,389
the threat level report

438
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:17,419
com threat level was unable to reach
anyone at the utility company Thursday

439
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:19,480
night to confirm the bridge

440
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,090
DHS spokesman Peter Boogaard after have
a name source right

441
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:26,330
at this time there's no credible
corroboree data indicate tourist to

442
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,889
critical infrastructure entities

443
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,960
or threat to public safety so they have
to bits of information to say this never

444
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,679
happened

445
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,720
more least one bit of information and no
confirmation

446
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,740
the actual source for the story and I'm
not gonna mention his name because these

447
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,830
pillars pected

448
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:46,428
is is a are yes respect the security guy

449
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:52,029
I i don't have it in my notes I can't
imagine anyone

450
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:55,169
but is well respected espada y to put in
there that want to him

451
00:25:55,169 --> 00:26:01,010
column out but so he has a a copy of the
draft report from a fusion center

452
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,950
the fusion centers or civilian-military
a civilian government

453
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,210
cooperation between home and security in
and Julian

454
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,789
law enforcement so he has a draft report
from his fusion center

455
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:15,320
dead a basically

456
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,689
said you know hackers broke into the win
was water plant and destroyed his palm

457
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,809
so he's talking to to Wired Kim Zetter I
wired

458
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:26,668
and I'm talking to cam and I immediately
call bullshit on a story when I see them

459
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:27,909
like this there's no

460
00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:31,570
there's no way to verify the story also
is a computer security expert

461
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:36,450
right and talking to carers and I why
you Britain scrappy store you have no

462
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,240
proof he's like

463
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,510
also also said that he's a reliable
source on he is not your source

464
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:45,090
are this unimportant he quoted from he
won't show you

465
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,820
that's our source and you don't even
have access to the primary information

466
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,500
and I don't think she got it I don't
know I and II hate them

467
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,240
you know right on campus she's she's
actually pretty good at what she does

468
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,820
usually

469
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,230
submit a story arm tell the reality

470
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:06,370
basically there was ok consultant who
used to work at the plant

471
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:10,120
was on vacation in Russia who still had
remote access

472
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,980
and remoted access back in while I was
on vacation Russia to the IP addresses

473
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,029
from Russia show up in the report

474
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:22,360
and everybody for example right nobody
bothered to call this guy and say hey

475
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,240
you know your login was used a

476
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,399
on the donors water to do have the login
while you're on vacation

477
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,690
know we call them they just immediately
Super Bowl IP's Russia

478
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:35,700
must be hackers right not on IM and go
to the whole point

479
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,110
why you have a contractor who still have
remote access

480
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:42,100
and who was allowed to access in from
outside the country that's a whole

481
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,070
nother story

482
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:47,600
arm the as a bunch a failure

483
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,890
I the better

484
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:55,179
I like this one

485
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:58,779
this this examples is kinda weird so
there was a report

486
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:02,000
again here we have a TSA memo in this
case is that a unreleased

487
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,860
uses a report that in attack was
executed on Northwest rail company they

488
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,110
don't

489
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,760
actually name which railroad company
that disrupted railway signals

490
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,059
for two days in December I don't know
what that means disrupted signals

491
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:18,110
so here we go again with in appearance
were greater

492
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,380
I rail schedules were delayed for 15
minutes after the interference

493
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:28,450
a stand this is a the yes a memo from a
summary of december twentieth meeting

494
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:34,130
ok if a security dot com Pacific
Northwest racing was attracted by

495
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,340
hackers as the essay

496
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,070
so you have that you have a memo from a
meeting that's immediately goes into

497
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,379
this massive attack

498
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,409
I confirmed by the TSA interesting how
that

499
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:47,840
goes around like that the reality was

500
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,020
there was no targeted computer-based
attack on a railroad

501
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,980
the memo on a story was based on
numerous inaccuracies

502
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,760
the eldest what does that mean ok are
you didn't pack was our I'm targeted

503
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,779
attack

504
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:04,669
II his qualifying statements they don't
actually get defined really upset me

505
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:07,960
there's I still don't know what all
happened here I there's nobody on the

506
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,340
record saying anything

507
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,020
I in so maybe it was it was in a
targeted attack maybe was just now where

508
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,049
notes right your

509
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:23,929
occurred and whether now I don't know
their form our ok

510
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:28,289
who commented out again second don't
forget that

511
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:31,899
again I assistant

512
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:36,779
well this was interesting on your him
tonight

513
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:41,220
so her cunt came out in a 2012

514
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,140
US-backed Yemen al Qaeda sides

515
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,020
a top US official has explicitly
acknowledge that the US government

516
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,740
hacked into web sites run by out

517
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,860
how it is affiliate in %um up

518
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,549
sectors that hillary rodham clinton was
a cyber says cyber experts based

519
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:03,668
at the State Department hacked you many
tribal web sites

520
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:07,010
this is pretty big news right this is a
Ana an official admission

521
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,279
by a senior government official that the
US government does

522
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:14,580
offensive cyber attacks the problem is
big news it was

523
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,809
you know back in May but its still
pretty big news right

524
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:23,289
especially because the US now considers
a cyberattack as an active war

525
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:27,379
right and has reserved the right to
retaliate with a traditional weapons

526
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:32,120
so does this mean that Yemen now bomb us
because we cyber attack them

527
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,490
yeah interesting question reality was
that the

528
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,179
a remarks were made at the special
operations or later on she says

529
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:44,200
this is the actual marks I our team
plaque to the same site with altered

530
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,159
versions of the ads

531
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:51,179
so basically they they broke into a web
form our homemade

532
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:55,649
and then soap this this is the actual
remarks she made at this that the

533
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:58,940
that the Special Operations Command gala
dinner those remarks

534
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,190
resulted in these new stories so

535
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:07,860
they change some ads already bought the
ads

536
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,350
so I'm from buying ads to hacking web
sites

537
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:16,600
ok washington plays exactly very broad
definition

538
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,640
I am the last post a previous version
incorrectly said that cyber expert had

539
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,870
happened al Qaeda state

540
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:28,840
they did not engage in hacking know they
didn't add bike

541
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,750
yeah couple more recent examples that I
didn't actually have time to

542
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,809
put make slides for I am arc on our
Technica

543
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:41,070
about a cyber gang war a couple other
basements between Israel Pakistan

544
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:44,510
another comes out to a gang war on the
Internet

545
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,740
I anonymous just deleted scene yes dot
com

546
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:53,190
and put down universal PCBs is not a
small website

547
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:56,480
your if you deleting it is going to take
a little bit

548
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,330
writer I mean it takes like a minute for
me to meet my

549
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:04,960
latest movie that I downloaded if I had
all CBS da comp it over multiple servers

550
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,250
and and probably mobile data centers
across the country

551
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,779
is going to take a little bit too
deleted over and i think what ended up

552
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:14,429
happening was it was a DNS poisoning our

553
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:19,470
what have you and the CBS Local Court
has no quotes from CBS or universal

554
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:23,529
not there's no verification is that they
just type in CBS are common gotta

555
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:27,950
got no pages all an honest with the
deleted

556
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,390
on they go

557
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,890
ha sites down here %uh to other recent
stories

558
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,960
the the right size does mention last our
core

559
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,220
yesterday I think I heard her before and
again the

560
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:46,279
there was a it otherwise in illinois'
law stuff happens in Illinois

561
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:50,320
I am nothing to do

562
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,110
use a condom so the air raid sirens go
off in a small town

563
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:58,700
nobody knows how to how it happened I
and the cops

564
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,850
quoted as saying we don't know what
happened we think we got hacked

565
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:08,350
yeah would

566
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,250
died

567
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,260
like here

568
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,410
I think because nobody else can get into
our systems

569
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:21,720
or something to that effect ok

570
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,809
I don't want to ever is on a San Diego
fireworks video

571
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:30,100
all powered water once ok don't know
exactly been a post-mortem donna is the

572
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,590
white sack to happen but there was one
news article

573
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:37,110
that said it was a virus Obama I don't
know if he actually quoted anybody here

574
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,120
he just made that up we wrote the
article

575
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,000
and no idea ok

576
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,250
as good

577
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,590
okay that's fine I can accept that your

578
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:55,650
yet so sorry I so want to pour all baby
was a virus on Mike

579
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:59,730
good how you getting this from but he's
making this up my point to your honor's

580
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,440
work

581
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,290
million page views of a bad word buyers
in I

582
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:11,139
where am i on time okay good always
example it only so far

583
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:14,290
are sorter

584
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:18,690
I was a malicious examples there's
ordered disorder militias but the more

585
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,119
accidental and more like

586
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:23,619
I need pageviews on a hike the story up
a little bit I am

587
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:28,520
this next example is or the actual up so
that the reporter actually when our

588
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,139
and tried to create hype on purpose I
and some you may remember this

589
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:38,859
the Michelle madigan affair a duck on
the competent think who's a producer for

590
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:40,000
NBC Universal

591
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,320
and dateline member dateline is famous
for the to catch a predator series

592
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,050
which is about as hyped up as you can
get there ok

593
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:52,280
she wanted to go to Def Con to portray
the criminal hacker underground

594
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,560
because all the criminals go dark on
writer

595
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,290
people can just be very interested in
what is going on Def Con number plan was

596
00:34:59,290 --> 00:34:59,930
to get

597
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:04,480
either in undercover federal agen to
admit he was undercover federal agent

598
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,470
Jeff Kahn war

599
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,859
to get people to admit that they were
having that they would commit crimes on

600
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,210
camera i'd I was your plan

601
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:17,810
that's why he went there on shoes at
DEFCON 15 2007 she did not get press

602
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,450
credentials

603
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:23,118
she went as a as a human right your

604
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,990
well that how they've gone has a bad as
human groom press whatever

605
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:30,780
and normal people get humans on

606
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,430
Def Con has buried a strict press rules
Iran

607
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,680
the press from their one year and it's
very important

608
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,509
that media identify themselves as media
and where press badge at all times

609
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,510
now I know journalist they go

610
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,859
to duck on as humans all the time as the

611
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:52,540
some reason they believe people talk to
them or they don't have a press badge on

612
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:52,890
right

613
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,618
and that's why I now have a problem with
that the lead identify themselves the

614
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:57,780
people are talking to

615
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,840
arm in a their human as well as press so
they can go human

616
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,660
but in this case somebody at dateline

617
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,960
I actually the story is that somebody
dateline

618
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,640
a ratted out Michelle to the Def Con
organizers

619
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,890
and told them what was going on so

620
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,220
Japanese other goons are welcome as a
mock we know you're pressed know you do

621
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,540
a sensational story

622
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,040
really watch directors Press right
likely to get press credentials

623
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,600
are and she refused i'm suppose the
shoes out numerous times to get press

624
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,210
credentials

625
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:32,300
ok so she

626
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,130
sittin energy sittin in the wanna talk
to Jeff Moss

627
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,530
had day had guide to congress up on
stage is as you know we have a special

628
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,560
guest here

629
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,290
I shared this is a short stories you
know me so mad he said right here

630
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:49,920
and it just turns all red runs out in a
row at probably not the best way to

631
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,609
handle that

632
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:54,850
not so of course he was chased out I
have the car by all the other reporters

633
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,580
like oh my god what's going on

634
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:02,470
I am and this is a picture for actually
running out a con to get to her car is

635
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,200
actually be over if you look on youtube

636
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,840
s like no other reporters running after
like so what do you have to say it is

637
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,320
running

638
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:14,700
you know they take like he would do
somebody else right he became a story

639
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,460
exactly I miss you honey just stood up
and said yeah

640
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,880
okay I'm press here give me a bad time
I'm I'm how did you know whatever ends

641
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,540
up back down over mental ballot but

642
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,920
didn't handle it very well but the
reason I bring this up is that it

643
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,710
because it is not an isolated case

644
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,410
I be rocked at least two other reporters
I know that attend

645
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:36,180
luck on regularly as humans as opposed
to press arm

646
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,359
so it's just

647
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,220
the reason I bring a story up is because
it did reverses the role

648
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,410
right previously as this this previous
this all the other examples

649
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:51,589
are again they don't they don't come out

650
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:55,600
they don't start out to create the hype
that's not the purpose of the article a

651
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,520
India page views probably in his cage
she actually wanted to manufacture hype

652
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,359
on purpose

653
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:04,250
so I felt it was important to include
her in your okay

654
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:07,930
this is an IP reality story

655
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:12,200
does article in the New York Times and
review that tried to

656
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,150
examine where all the cybercrime losses
were going

657
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:21,530
okay supposedly doesn't enrolled records
from Los a hundred and fourteen billion

658
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:22,900
dollars worldwide

659
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,800
related to cybercrime that a lot of
freakin money at 214 Instagram's

660
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,130
on a

661
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,320
basically what they found was that the
estimates used to calculate cybercrime

662
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,750
obey some very bad statistical methods

663
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,900
basically these political polling
methods and then extrapolated that

664
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,800
information

665
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,760
to get their total number but when you
doing that we do it that way you give

666
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,859
out liars

667
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:50,790
a much higher Wade you dated and they
should have

668
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,370
okay and most I did but they but mostly

669
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,960
the estimates for the cybercrime polls
the dollar amount come from base with

670
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,450
two people

671
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:05,930
I'm most credit card sold online or sold
for pennies

672
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,580
right you track to data your name
information a credit card number

673
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,730
did not sold for hundreds of billions of
dollars are sold for pennies because

674
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,750
very hard to monetize

675
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,900
credit card information you don't see
cybercrime billionaires out there if

676
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,130
there's a hundred fourteen billion
dollars

677
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:26,090
for around you think it is one person
had who earned a billion

678
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:29,910
otherwise is a helluva lot of
cybercriminals making pennies

679
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:33,830
and I don't know there are not really
any companies that have lost billions do

680
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,740
cybercrime

681
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,000
right where is all this money coming
from if there's a hundred and fourteen

682
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,520
billion dollars worth lost

683
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,500
and I put this story in your because it
it the it's very

684
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,290
factual I want said maybe not be the
right word but it's very non I bennett

685
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:51,050
pose a lot a high bar to block the other
stories that you re

686
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:55,200
any helped put those things and burt
example the next time you read

687
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,810
a story this is also a hacker's cost
this much money cause this much

688
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:02,230
in losses you know maybe you can still
take that with a grain of salt say well

689
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,940
maybe they did

690
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,000
with whom going too fast as usual
alright

691
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,250
our reality a mic height does have

692
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,460
one small benefit like to thank our

693
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,530
is that it can be used to raise
awareness alright people can

694
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:22,270
people who may not have normally pay
attention to a story may pay attention

695
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:22,800
to it

696
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,310
because a hyper and that may be a good
thing

697
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:29,430
but there's a lot of bad things that
happen because a hike

698
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:34,290
right you have a chicken we look back
all the goddess guys balling

699
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,529
not a good thing the boy who cried wolf
pack same idea

700
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,970
actually do enough time to read or
listen to hear

701
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:44,510
hype is used a lot by PR flacks if you
if you're on it any

702
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:48,240
its uranium for a sec community in union
workers good company and you get the

703
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,040
email from

704
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,279
press releases in stock it's like a big
story breaks twenty minutes later you

705
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,540
get a press release from some other
companies doing all we can solve that

706
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,570
problem

707
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,890
we have a solution for you you can

708
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,868
now politicians use but and hyper

709
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:07,240
all the time to pass laws and you'll see
is all

710
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,380
as as that is the the the budget review

711
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,300
cycle comes around and there there's a
specific law on the Hornets getting

712
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,140
ready to pass the hype machine start
ramping up

713
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,609
and you'll see all the stories come out
you'd like while suddenly we get all the

714
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:21,540
stories about this

715
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:25,630
being nobody cares about was because
there's a new law is gonna get past them

716
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,880
they're trying to drum up support for

717
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,780
Mike and of course that makes us all
look bad the matter with your hackers

718
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,320
group National whatever

719
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,720
the hype just that is you know we're
gonna cause in the world

720
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,820
a good thing

721
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,839
night

722
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,078
identifying hike just because you see a
hundred versions the same sorry

723
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,640
doesn't use true and I this is very

724
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,230
very common because if it's a good if it
well hired if it's got a lotta good

725
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:55,650
night

726
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:58,770
it's going to get republish the
Republican republished and you gonna see

727
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,049
in every news outlet

728
00:42:00,049 --> 00:42:04,900
that did exist but don't believe me just
because it published everywhere doesn't

729
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,660
make it true

730
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,009
just because you say it three times and
lands by reference and I'm

731
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:13,309
arm look for named quotes in the story

732
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:17,700
if the story has no name quote I or name
because they don't really matter

733
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,290
without saying anything is a pretty good
idea is a lot of hype involved okay

734
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,579
I if there's no wonder call like

735
00:42:24,579 --> 00:42:27,250
if you had the ability to pick up a
phone call somebody is that he did this

736
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,299
really happen

737
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:32,180
and the net maybe that's not as hard as
you think it is but that's not there

738
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,808
then ask questions if it blames an
unknown entity

739
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:40,809
no I don't know maybe an hour or China
or hackers or whatever

740
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:45,549
the blames an entity that again you
can't bear buyer can't speak out for

741
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:46,200
themselves

742
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,849
look for big details

743
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:56,359
you backs you know a get a recitation
acclaimed actors control satellite again

744
00:42:56,359 --> 00:42:57,720
I say ICS story

745
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,900
like every five years I don't know why I
keep coming up I guess it's it's very

746
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,940
sensational

747
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,880
oh my god they're they're controlling
the said the lasers above our heads are

748
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,819
gonna shoot us all

749
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:10,190
just because you see a story

750
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:15,569
on a trusted website doesn't mean that
the story itself should be trusted

751
00:43:15,569 --> 00:43:19,329
I did you know some resources that a
quote in here comes on security in

752
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:21,210
addition our blog at Slashdot

753
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:26,230
not as nice as trusted but I'll just
because it's on a popular site that you

754
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,650
read every day and you can you trust the
person is give you that information

755
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,650
doesn't mean you shouldn't question the
information

756
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:37,069
basin was coming from question
everything writer

757
00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:40,670
I'm not be part of a hike if you heard

758
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:45,599
talking to Press or or your talking to
reporters I think this is mentioned in a

759
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:51,069
in the last talk as well arm if you're
in law enforcement or skirt rational

760
00:43:51,069 --> 00:43:54,099
hacker they always walking for a good
quote special somebody on video

761
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:57,920
don't if something is causing take me
quite a story don't

762
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,270
talk pick up when they are first I don't
be talkin to Corning is easel

763
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:05,490
who's never written if a sec story porn
is lighter

764
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:09,839
get their name cooler name similar
stories a Briton

765
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,980
if they only written hype stories and we
never written about sex stories just say

766
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,380
thank you thank you all you can talk to
somebody else

767
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,869
writer its important

768
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:24,319
to not be a part of the hype I think if
you can't go on the record

769
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,380
don't say anything there's nothing worse
than

770
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:31,880
then reading a quote from a high place
government official but did

771
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:37,290
no help to anybody when you are talking
to a reporter be careful

772
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,759
when you're making sensational statement
okay in especially

773
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,200
for example the owners water department
hack with a pump broke one respective

774
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,430
scary researcher

775
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,759
who just freaked out when I saw this
report call the reporters in New just

776
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,150
started

777
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:53,910
you know freaking out with this guy was
born double-decker

778
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:57,339
if you're a journalist and if you're a
journalist I should have to tell you

779
00:44:57,339 --> 00:44:59,160
this so if you're a reporter

780
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,299
better by your sources I don't think any
quote from anybody you get

781
00:45:03,299 --> 00:45:07,160
now I know you can always get somebody
going recker

782
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:11,020
I ask them why they can't go on the
record right make sure they're not just

783
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,559
trying to plan a story for you

784
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:17,670
find somebody else will go on the record
if the biggest or you will find someone

785
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:19,530
willing to go on the record to give your
name well

786
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:22,540
ask yourself as a reporter

787
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:29,540
is a better to be burst was a better be
correct well we know the answer

788
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:35,210
reporters I don't think do ok

789
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:38,690
II be a part of the reality if you see
something

790
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:44,480
say something girl I said about dot the
reality dying a quick beer

791
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,609
if you have a question about a story
write a comment on the story put a red

792
00:45:48,609 --> 00:45:49,900
unabomber page

793
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,150
20 needed between I W stories crap

794
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:57,010
right write a blog post make your
YouTube video

795
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,329
give a talk at Hope I say something

796
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:03,359
because what happens is that people like
me people chases cock

797
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,680
who are looking for the history in
looking for the reality we go back ten

798
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,609
years later

799
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:10,880
all we're gonna find is that kevin
Mitnick a break in the norad we're never

800
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,000
gonna find a reality

801
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,799
and so that really that hide lives on
for ever never never ends up bad choices

802
00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:16,140
I'll

803
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:21,200
and I think that's all I have I have a
longer biography

804
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,220
the slide to be up on a

805
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:28,180
my website space rock dotnet at some
point arm

806
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:32,069
probably another month or so Twitter
handle at space rover

807
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:37,109
I think I have 7 minutes left for
questions anybody has any

808
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:44,109
course I can see anybody's hands I think
we have a microphone over here

809
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,349
all right we've got if you can be loud
but you gotta be really loud

810
00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:53,010
you Mike communism Mike I get misguided
but you go first got

811
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:57,119
okay I first live I have a are coming in
slow say to whoever said there's nothing

812
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,420
to do with Illinois

813
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,770
I within the city Chicago your fucking
right 1 345 miles outside Chicago

814
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:04,630
there's nothing

815
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:07,890
arm if you're going to bring sorrow
before about the sirens

816
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:12,279
I I'm 37 years old I've ridden Chicago
most my wife

817
00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:16,109
those things go off periodically and
have been since I was born

818
00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:19,470
so it's like why all the sudden are they
talking about hackers getting into it

819
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,140
but to

820
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:24,569
anyway oMG why I have come about are two
part question for you

821
00:47:24,569 --> 00:47:28,099
are but I think actually kind of answer
the second I'll answer the first one

822
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:28,660
like how

823
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,759
how can you determine whether or not the
first story was right saying that it was

824
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,680
hackers

825
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,859
or the second story say no was in
hackers

826
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:39,799
and I second part of the question is do
you mean all

827
00:47:39,799 --> 00:47:43,290
love any instances where people said you
know what Tom

828
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:47,558
I was hackers and then it and then some
hacker group came out said yeah we did

829
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:50,109
only to find out that the story was
refuted later

830
00:47:50,109 --> 00:47:53,420
there's probably on that part is second
part a question yeah there's probably

831
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,569
someone honest examples about that

832
00:47:55,569 --> 00:48:00,099
I don't have one of them had to give you
I is probably has happen

833
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:03,460
dozens various factors anonymous have
been claiming the

834
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,980
responsibility for despite everything
you know the league's TBS for example

835
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:11,020
arm the first party a question

836
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,069
and in our heart for God a

837
00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:17,160
base with how do you know which store in
all your eyes with our

838
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,470
I do you how do you know what to believe
the hype for the reality because

839
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:20,359
sometimes heard that

840
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:23,700
as you see in the 100 know which one is
right which one is real because you

841
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,339
still have name sources to our backs and
and

842
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:29,490
I like to think that intelligent people

843
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,809
can look at both and make up your mind
right arm

844
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:37,299
especially if the story changes later I
like to think that the change in this

845
00:48:37,299 --> 00:48:40,509
later version is probably more accurate
than the earlier version

846
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:44,450
not always the case I'll but that's what
I tend to look at

847
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:47,359
especially the first person is totally
outlandish in the you know my god we're

848
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,180
all gonna and

849
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,210
and the reason the the second version is
like all well know that was ongoing and

850
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:53,279
this is the kinda normal

851
00:48:53,279 --> 00:48:57,740
right told The the pack at least
resistance the simple answer wins

852
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:01,270
in my book right it also seems to be
that always blaming hackers were things

853
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:04,319
where or why don't they actually call
hackers when things go wrong

854
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,549
and say hey you guys can help us fix
this I would be good no be good every

855
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:10,359
five minutes what sets you free burn
through some these questions

856
00:49:10,359 --> 00:49:14,240
hey amber do you have any tips for how
do we try to dispel hi

857
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,349
in people there completely non-technical
I have

858
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:21,940
a specific 1i think every month into I
senior exec my company has a really true

859
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:22,609
that

860
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:26,380
the cybercrime industry is as big or
bigger than the drivetrain

861
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,710
that yet rated yeah keep iraq I don't
even know the sorceress I N

862
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:35,040
%uh a hard time who will dispelling I
think if you're if you're trying to

863
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,450
convince other people and you don't have
the skills to do your cell

864
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:42,880
arm use Google or try to brains my
people that made

865
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,109
no more than you I who can help you with
our

866
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:49,730
its it's hard to say if you know if
you're being asked to dispel

867
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:53,540
I that you have no knowledge I'll but
you know what I am

868
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,970
because the cycle is a sensational but I
have the degree in finance or so

869
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:00,819
yeah exactly it's difficult i mean it
took me a long time to find some of

870
00:50:00,819 --> 00:50:02,619
these articles even though I knew

871
00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:06,339
what the truth was to find the actual
proof that the put in the car

872
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:12,400
and its ours is difficult time

873
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:18,270
without three minutes I am not really
sure I miss it a pan-arab pattern

874
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:21,710
by journalists not just reporters

875
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:26,839
over the past well pipe for many years
but its its happening in like

876
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:31,170
the most major New York Times Wall
Street Journal seen any new name

877
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:34,680
they will say a arm

878
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,460
Lockwood no the whole refer to some

879
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:42,109
grew by Klein fortune law enforcement
officials believe

880
00:50:42,109 --> 00:50:45,520
that such as a Japanese law enforcement
officials believe so and so

881
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,640
just months before during this initial
your name source

882
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,560
will not happen it's the same that this
government official

883
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,950
believe something how do you know what
they believe

884
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:00,700
law enforcement agencies agency has the
politicians

885
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,790
corporate officials do they not
misrepresent what they

886
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:08,339
think sometimes not just sometimes it
happens all the time

887
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:13,020
they say go ahead as it sometimes that's
the Weasley words above the reporter

888
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:17,700
putting not putting words in the sources
now sure to cover their own ass

889
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,520
right because reporter can say well you
know bar Portman said this but they can

890
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,359
save of course the

891
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:25,660
I think this practice should be banned
in all journalism because there's no way

892
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,598
the any journalist or reporter

893
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,890
can possibly know what another person
believes that it is

894
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:35,950
ordinary if you you could count found
millions have examples of this happening

895
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:39,589
it's bullshit that so on

896
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:42,849
when you see that ask questions because
because in

897
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:47,259
it is it's bullshit and I i have written
many reporters over the years on

898
00:51:47,259 --> 00:51:50,680
on other things every mother's alright
reporter and a column in something

899
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,540
and they usually get back to me Anderson
a stunt like somebody like call them on

900
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,329
it and they're like yeah I'll be careful
margin

901
00:51:56,329 --> 00:51:59,980
that if we all did at added when they
get a good point nobody ever emails

902
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,310
reporter or the editor

903
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:05,170
I do the editor iight right when he was
a female reporter in ICC the editor get

904
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:08,049
it on the website chat only after
leading to find it with your editor is

905
00:52:08,049 --> 00:52:09,670
within the letter was a reminder

906
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:13,170
the ice and ice and I sent it to both
yes so then there's accountability

907
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:16,880
yes an all-wheel don't usually care yes
