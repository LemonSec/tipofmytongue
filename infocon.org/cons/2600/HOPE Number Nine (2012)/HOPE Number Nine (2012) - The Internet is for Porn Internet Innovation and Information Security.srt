00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,819
for many the storage in databases that
you might be using today

48
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,700
and I focus on databases virtualization

49
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,860
structure actually started when I was a
teenager making web sites for porn

50
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,379
companies and multi-level marketing
companies

of the largest

55
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,489
porn databases with some special search
in

56
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:38,739
features for finding 1i 1n I can't hide

57
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:43,230
anything cell skin color noble science

58
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,610
an this was when like aid I first came
out you could actually do streaming

59
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,989
video and audio stream from the database

60
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:55,790
I was in and then alright so

61
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,370

67
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,279
her two friends using the internet to

69
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:27,509
how many have never actually had to
investigate pornography incident I am

70
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:33,258
has anyone ever think that they were
ever exposed to illegal pornography

71
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:36,940
K why on earth as legal pornography

72
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,449
running a really depends on your country
but not everywhere can get

73
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:46,560
porn likely there's Wikipedia who knew
it was so sexy right

74
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,660
a little shape send a little a

75
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,160
at some other top searches on Wikipedia

76
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,550
yes so what is legal pornography

77
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,600
in the united states are some very
specific definitions

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,550
this country is rather unusual in the
fact that computer-generated

79
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,690
a child pornography is also illegal

80
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,199
like this said the the definition of
Legal Porn

81
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,759
changes from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction

82
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,039
a erotic materials are not considered
obscene

83
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,650
there is a definition above scene and
there's a definition

84
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,180
erotica and pornography their different

85
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,960
a so

86
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,479
and different countries and different
states

87
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,180
there are differences and the definition
of actually what they consider obscene

88
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,009
as well

89
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:43,030
handout yes exactly

90
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,270
a but the actual definition a what is

91
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,789
obscene was from 1968 Supreme Court
ruling

92
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:55,669
Jacob else purses Ohio at the Supreme
Court Justice said

93
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:58,889
I know it when I see it sir and this

94
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:02,100
is not it he was referring to a movie

95
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,560
operator who was fined twenty five
hundred dollars for showing basically

96
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,039
what week

97
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,900
we consider a soft porn a maybe soft
porn

98
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,430
a movie that involved some ladies and so
forth but to

99
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,389
it went all the way up to the Supreme
Court and now we have an actual

100
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:18,380
definition

101
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,650
what is obscene and what is not now

102
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,199
pornography is actually brought us a lot
great advance

103
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,410
advancements both in internet and
hardware

104
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,110
now first porn online services were in
the eighties

105
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,259
like most about us we had a really slow
systems

106
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:41,949
I know if someone in Diego Garcia who
looked at it over 75 by

107
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:45,220
teletype line have patience yes

108
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,880
so Usenet a gray an event innovation for
porn

109
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,990
and that's all I gotta say about that I
know the web usage

110
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,500
ru at an amazing amount especially with
in college years

111
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,819
because a pornography and

112
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:05,780
dot com burn what would have been
without pornography

113
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,180
so more the technical advancements

114
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:15,030
were in the cortex used the biggest was
probably actually jeep ad push

115
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,110
video because it allowed video streaming
with

116
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,530
our plugins cuz plugin sock

117
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,430
who he remembers RealPlayer

118
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,400
yeah yeah I think that up one of my
favorites when I was a teenager is

119
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:29,750
called

120
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,210
see you see me oh yeah yeah

121
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,350
cell I mean from that we got the more
advanced kodak's

122
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,630
many are used today like H 323 for way

123
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,300
in those services also MP force came out
of that

124
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,580
because and give its because im a all of
the different licensing restrictions on

125
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,340
the kodak's

126
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,340
we also got major advances

127
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,389
in online payment systems up

128
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:59,850
world pay in CC bill before pornography
in the push for

129
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,229
identification people's agers

130
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:08,550
they were just doing in abstract modem
transfers things like that but because

131
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,870
im

132
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,440
porn web sites needed a reliable payment
system

133
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,940
so there's a clear trend and OneWorld
pain CC bill

134
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,010
first came out released their online
processing systems

135
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:24,169
and pornography burn and of course pay
pal

136
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:27,609
it how such and also got

137
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,800
Paris Hilton yet nevermind for

138
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,640
and Chocolate Rain and who the fuck is
that guy

139
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,218
railing I have no idea alright

140
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,070
we also got a lot of hardware advance
without it global load balancers

141
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,600
you don't want your viewers on your porn
going to slow website across the country

142
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,990
Cisco came out with some the bass global
load balancers

143
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,000
nowadays we have many other companies in
that space and sis goes back in now

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,540
we also got wind accelerators

145
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,390
river bed now 5 they'd prolly be nowhere
without pornography

146
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,490
I mean they built from the most
sophisticated

147
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,959
TCP stacks decides what comes out a BSD

148
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,990
at any around we also got

149
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,190
SSL accelerators before sign in a couple
other companies

150
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,520
started pushing in thousand dollars to
sell accelerators

151
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,010
I mean you take an entire server farm to
host

152
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,250
one small porn website i no one in my
sights in

153
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,690
ninety 6 to a thousand servers

154
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,070
and then we dropped into signs with
ourselves our readers

155
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,390
to replace them so that was an
incredible

156
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,579
advancement it was on-chip

157
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:45,800
encryption and decryption for the masses

158
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,650
I mean back when I did the the
consulting to the government were you

159
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,150
seen

160
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,970
million dollar walking crafters kg
enforce

161
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,750
game 7's those were just not possible
for pornography and it made it

162
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,200
popular we also got advances in digital
cams

163
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,630
anywhere would your day DSLR be today

164
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,560
if the money wasn't there from webcam
sales before like attack

165
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,610
before those companies came out these
are things that we

166
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,709
touch every day so to speak and week

167
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:22,180
yeah we've we wouldn't know

168
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,450
that they were advances because a
pornography we don't think art

169
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,829
why did most people via webcam in the
nineties

170
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:33,589
seriously yeah and

171
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:36,910
low-cost high quality recording mediums

172
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:43,140
and there's been some security-related
incidents that have brought

173
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,279
a is security innovation

174
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,810
into play for example the Melissa virus
crashed email servers around the world

175
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,670
when it occurred

176
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,709
so did the in a corner cover virus when
it came about again

177
00:10:55,709 --> 00:11:00,529
from some of these a security-related
incidents

178
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:03,600
we have gotten email filtration

179
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,360
web filtration at when Twitter was hit
with

180
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,550
porn spam they switched over to TLS

181
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,730
instead up area instead over

182
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,470
SSL we now have in addition to that

183
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,500
a browsers

184
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,140
in private mode or otherwise call porn
mo

185
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,579
had another poem exactly

186
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:34,310
a digital ID's to make sure that age
verification could occur

187
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:39,300
private bpm using proxies to make sure
that nobody could see all the

188
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,160
interesting little bit supporting that
we're looking at

189
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,850
who uses tore I hear

190
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,670
there you go and nowadays

191
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:55,150
funny in a and it is safer to Sir a porn
site than it is to read a plot to visit

192
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,860
a company site or to visit

193
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,339
a religious site in semantic study is
religious web sites are three times more

194
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:09,050
likely to contain viruses from porn
sites

195
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,599
Braden

196
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,089
now the economics internet porn

197
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:20,069
so there's a lot of revenue that has
been generated from pornography you're

198
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,969
talking about

199
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,579
at the various filtration you're talking
about the monitoring employees you're

200
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,749
talking about

201
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:30,019
on the back and litigation and legal
fees

202
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:34,159
and what other ways can anyone think Oh

203
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,849
anymore

204
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:42,419
a webcam site housewives congressman
money

205
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:46,779
it's a homegrown business nowadays
anything else

206
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:50,029
they don't think I've welcome on

207
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:54,379
payment clearing house payment clearing
houses in

208
00:12:54,379 --> 00:13:01,379
Houston

209
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:13,720
yeah site sites for amateur porn

210
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,630
yeah blame me there's more sites like
that

211
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,820
and I'll tell you afterwards a

212
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,300
fared better her the hell no

213
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,560
yes ballet x hamster

214
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,590
chatroulette video yeah

215
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:39,080
or penis roulette so

216
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,300
P brings in a lot of money a

217
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,350
also taxable as well so it's a

218
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,640
revenue generation for many governments
around the world

219
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,790
I it's quite amazing that although the
United States a seems to have a very

220
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,719
interesting viewing pornography

221
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,970
a it brings in more money

222
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,660
a in this country then all up the
organized a sports franchises put

223
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,400
together

224
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,860
I'll a they say in new porn movie is
created on average every 39 minutes as

225
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,530
comes from

226
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,550
ABN media network in order to get on

227
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,720
their list you actually have to be a
larger

228
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,310
pornographer so this is an actual even
count any homegrown porn

229
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,350
so I would venture to say

230
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,760
I would be a little bit more often than
once every thirty nine minutes

231
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,840
that is the density

232
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,440
a pornography subscriptions in the
United States

233
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,170
and three-point play now curiously
enough the darker the color

234
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,220
a yeah p.m. well you know I did

235
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,750
it what else are you gonna do there
exactly it's safer to surf porn then

236
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,150
religious web sites are certain to make
the

237
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,699
stretch wrap it's all about security

238
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,280
my head so

239
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,310
the 4.9 billion is

240
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:08,350
just white ABN has reported and he
didn't know if the announcement a porn

241
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,860
award show every

242
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,760
Jan every January in Vegas go to it some

243
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,430
good all the other web sites web cam
sites personal sites

244
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:22,380
I'm those are not included in this
number we're probably looking at

245
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,300
four-year $50 billion in annual revenue
just on

246
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,860
and with all the side revenue the
hardware to software

247
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,020
I N it is incredible match in the
storage needed

248
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,329
I just one one distributor hundreds
terabytes of storage

249
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:43,650
noted

250
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,949
so this is what the picture looks about
that the legality of pornography

251
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,730
and so we can see the United States
opposed to be allowed not censored

252
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,460
I am now interesting enough in India

253
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,420
this the the stats are actually about
India although is partially legal in

254
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,750
India they've made some very restrictive
laws very recently

255
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,280
some laws and I don't think any of us
would want to follow such as any time

256
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,209
you want to use a cyber cafe or even
Starbucks wifi they have to I D you

257
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:16,470
in photograph that identification all
computer screens have to be in plain

258
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,240
sight so if you're trying to do private
banking or anything else not that I

259
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,760
would use a cyber cafe today

260
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,730
to do in a banking but all the screens
have to be in plain sight and monitored

261
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,600
by the staff

262
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,260
so nothing is private a a copy of the ID
is kept

263
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,460
on record on file at the local cyber
cafe

264
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,600
the browsing histories are stored for at
least

265
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,180
one-year hit up

266
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,560
and every month also per capita is have
to send

267
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,690
all other data to the Indian government

268
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:54,010
these are things that don't sound too
comfortable to me

269
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,430
another example

270
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,150
feet high a blacklist the Thai
government

271
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,530
a decided to institute a countrywide
blacklist against a child pornography

272
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,389
web sites

273
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,959
as a protective measure so anything that

274
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,370
might be considered erotic art scene
involving minors i angry with that okay

275
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,449
fair enough accept it turns out that
them

276
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:22,970
over 1200 web sites are actually block
because the critical up the royal family

277
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,170
%uh I don't think that that has much to
do with pornography

278
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,480
I don't know Bosak

279
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,760
yeah

280
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,490
if you've seen the royal family down yep

281
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,750
a and one of the biggest problems is of
course is blacklist is

282
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,910
completely non-transparent there's no
way to see what's on a blacklist appear

283
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,180
on the black was how to fight against
the black list to get your name of

284
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,580
in recently a

285
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,689
there was a US citizen that was
sentenced to two and a half years in

286
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:56,620
prison

287
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,120
a his crime were was tweeting

288
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,520
a translation oven unauthorized
biography of the king of thailand

289
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:11,520
he was just pardon this week discussing
Australia

290
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,530
now Australia is a very interesting
situation

291
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,310
they have a blacklist a run by the ACM

292
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,580
paying at the ACMA is not elected

293
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,669
and that is without judicial review they
decided a couple years ago

294
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,020
that they believe that women

295
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,780
adult women with small breasts a
encouraged

296
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,950
child pornography exactly

297
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,910
exactly they also considered female
ejaculation as a fetish

298
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,060
I didn't hear them blocking pornography
a

299
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,090
men with that less than average members
or

300
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:55,050
merely Jackie elation or well I'm tired
genre as a pornography would be off

301
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,399
limits in Australia

302
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,210
and as an example

303
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,210
this if she was naked would be perfectly
fine with the ACMA

304
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,790
Guinness Book of World Records your

305
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,790
comparing BP

306
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:17,950
getting the Guinness Book not me
something else and there's a a couple

307
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,630
other

308
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,810
things at about two days ago was
announced that

309
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:25,470
a new law that going through Australia
might require

310
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,510
every Australian resident or citizen to
him

311
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,980
over their passwords to all other social
networking

312
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,900
account so that the Australian
government can properly monitor the

313
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,620
Internet and social networking

314
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,230
this happen just two days ago alright

315
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,730
in the news just this week Russia
actually passed in very bad

316
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,750
sensors censorship law now it's
basically

317
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,830
a blacklist extremist content

318
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:59,490
now why is extremist content it anything
they want it to be

319
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,800
cell all webpages and web sites
containing ban pornography

320
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,389
drug ads and promoting suicide or
extremist

321
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,490
ideas like this conference to them

322
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,620
Zack should be put on a unified
additional blacklist

323
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,150
there's actually been a new agency for
mean

324
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,929
to monitor this so that's a lotta money
that they don't have

325
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:28,190
to monitor stuff that they shouldn't
care about

326
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:31,360
now there's actually a Russian search
and engine

327
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,660
Yandex whose stocks plummeted

328
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,380
over this a softy is Google for their
porn

329
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,280
so now our own FCC who has usually been
pretty poor

330
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,670
on things like this in the past actually
have the gall to come out and speak

331
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,340
against the bill

332
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,379
so it's troubling in and dangerous dire
action

333
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,120
how many times we felt that about the
FCC good

334
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,590
yeah now also in the news this week

335
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,659
this is actually been a very big week
around the world

336
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,300
for censorship ethiopia

337
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,820
now Ethiopia is not a good place to be
and

338
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,290
the government has been blocking new
sites and blogs like bit larger ones

339
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:20,159
I for about seven years now now they're
actually starting to block facebook

340
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,330
smaller blocks and news services

341
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,389
that sucks they're also blocking in

342
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,010
Skype and VoIP services now because they
want

343
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,170
everybody to use the state-run telephone
network

344
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:37,920
they can't happen monitor all calls and
make money at the same time

345
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,100
yes now also in the news as if that
wasn't enough censorship happening this

346
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,150
week

347
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,020
China China is actually going to require

348
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,330
all online content distributors

349
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,189
to monitor and watch every single video

350
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,250
and make sure it is OK

351
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,310
now what is OK in China so

352
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:06,320
now two different organizations but this
out the State Administration of radio

353
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,770
film and television

354
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,790
in the state internet information office

355
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:13,860
the propaganda office now boger content

356
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,220
excessive violence Arpana and
pornography are going to be banned

357
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,360
so a search engine Youku

358
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,690
said political speech if it isn't I
party in anti-social

359
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,540
it definitely will not pass that's
pretty scary

360
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,629
but we're in america were saved from all
that right

361
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:39,440
absolutely so up the current US claim it
right now

362
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,900
the US signed actor now actor isn't

363
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,540
a specifically popcorn I'm for free but
it does a

364
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,220
have some mentions about some
copyrighted material

365
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,460
which to is part of the slippery slope

366
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,320
so to speak with the protecting certain
financial interest to web blocking

367
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,040
sensor

368
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:04,990
content an there's quite a few parallels
between active people in so per

369
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,240
I am their big groups like Doctors
Without Borders have spoken out against

370
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,160
this

371
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,020
or risking not only are online freedoms

372
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,220
but also things like generic medications

373
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,830
or other medications so these things are
not good

374
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,300
for any a bus a

375
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,590
we have a current presidential candidate
who

376
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:31,730
wants to if he is president wants to
sign an executive order

377
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,070
up for there to be away in every
household

378
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,129
for someone to Press a button

379
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:42,470
to block out possible pornography he is
very anti

380
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,960
porn so is a sum up his backers

381
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,010
mister romney all to protect minors of
course from

382
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,440
last seen possible pornography or where
they came from

383
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,679
who do you think's actually installing
the computers in these homes

384
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,020
the kids yeah yes

385
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,340
yeah now you what's the real reason

386
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:11,129
behind actor pepper sober I mean it's
not to save the children

387
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,090
to save the money absolute its copyright

388
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,240
now walt Disney was sorta right when he
said

389
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,310
I only hope that we don't lose one thing
that was all started

390
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,379
by a mouse all of these legislations

391
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,460
all these protective actions all the
censorship

392
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,130
is just covering up re always to monitor
us

393
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,130
and make the money now everyone knows

394
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:39,429
about the Mickey Mouse copyright laws
mickey mouse will never die

395
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:43,929
it will always be in copyright so as
long as that happens

396
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:47,210
there'll be new paper's news opens new
PB lock stock

397
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:52,440
whatever cell it's a future ahead of us
we just have to

398
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,900
inform as many people as possible

399
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,210
corporate censorship

400
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:05,960
up iraq now and erotica author

401
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,900
sad I wanna pinch myself to see a fine
way and sometimes I wonder

402
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,960
is this really happening to me now
there's a whole lotta

403
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,130
erotica online Amazon stores in the
bookstores

404
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,720
for candles I am but not everyone likes
it

405
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,020
especially on the device manufactures
Apple all

406
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,810
we all love Apple well not really but
like their mac book

407
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,030
now Apple started censoring books in

408
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,389
out in 2010 anything that felt

409
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,800
anything that I've felt was dirty or

410
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,950
moral or they can get multiple countries
now they

411
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,280
began censoring photography in multiple
forms on their iPad

412
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,770
because they won a clean product wanna
my background as photography

413
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,940
so II and many others

414
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,100
have wanted to perhaps in Apple's App
Store

415
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,190
most my photographer friends were female
have opened up boudoir versions

416
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,330
up their businesses for women they make

417
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:13,540
e-books out a photo shoots things like
that Apple is constantly rejecting them

418
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,960
an earlier this month

419
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,370
a Cisco did a very interesting thing for
some %uh versa

420
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,530
residential can customers with some

421
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:28,420
the higher and home routers all the
sudden wind

422
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,290
people want to use their internet they
notice that the

423
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:36,240
the year local administration up there
own router piece of hardware that they

424
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,870
bought

425
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,140
that they set up and configure
themselves that they thought that they

426
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,610
own the piece of hardware and their
administration

427
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:48,050
was actually moved to Cisco's Connect
cloud service

428
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:51,840
I without a choice without notice
without anything

429
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,150
this is Cole cloud service was very
interesting because it had some very

430
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,230
arm strange Anna

431
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,560
shall we say a leading into censorship
terms and conditions

432
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,570
some other terms and conditions

433
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,080
were you agree not to use this product

434
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,610
for anything obscene any pornographic or

435
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,730
offensive purposes and then below it

436
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,270
intellectual property rights go hand in
hand don't thing

437
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,700
now what would

438
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,120
e-books be without pornography it made

439
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,870
audible dot com its makin Amazon's
bookstore right now

440
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:38,010
mommy porn Harlequin

441
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,080
I love that now milf porn is actually
holding in

442
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,879
the top four spots this is a three-book
series

443
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,430
holding the top worse by yeah

444
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:53,760
because the three-book series as a
single item

445
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,700
the spot number for in

446
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,140
yes by women go for

447
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,990
okay the current

448
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:09,370
international climate I was very happy I
happen to reside in the European Union

449
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,370
in the Netherlands

450
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:13,560
and my country a a

451
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,830
voted down an actor in said that a it

452
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:21,490
they were not even allowed to bring a
biller treaty to the Dutch parliament

453
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,350
that even resembled actor

454
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,230
finally the day that I landed in this
country on the fourth of July I got a

455
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,690
text message the actor was completely
defeated

456
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,800
in the EU Parliament so we're very happy
about

457
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:39,750
passion however

458
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,480
a

459
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,540
a we're still under attack in the United
Kingdom

460
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,779
they want to do some very interesting

461
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:49,580
things about censorship in pornography
since one of the MP's

462
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,370
commented that it was his goal to clean
up the Internet

463
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:56,820
so what they yeah exactly I

464
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,480
so what they would like to do is every
person who has

465
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,779
internet per your account are you will
have the

466
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:07,210
everything of pornography will be
blocked but you will have the option to

467
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,980
op in to see pornography just like I
would love to be on a government list

468
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,870
saying that I have opted in to view
pornography

469
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:19,159
the next step will probably be what type
of pornography in fetish

470
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:22,470
in material you would like to use I say
that because

471
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:26,419
they did a study in gathered some
information the United Kingdom did

472
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:31,450
a putting in your opt in and what types
of things and unfortunately the

473
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,889
a list due to lack of security

474
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:39,230
I was compromised and posted online

475
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,509
so are ready before they instituted any

476
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:45,659
kinda legal program they are ready
spread

477
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,600
information about their citizens they
had no business doing so I don't

478
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,340
particularly

479
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,909
trust a government having my name on a
list

480
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:57,649
associated with viewing pornography a

481
00:29:57,649 --> 00:30:01,200
the United Kingdom also want to consider
a black box

482
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,440
like on the airlines that is installed

483
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,769
on every home computer up a

484
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:10,779
which can monitor all social networking

485
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:15,440
and all email traffic so that's been
proposed that's quite scary

486
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,429
I wouldn't want that in their home a box
monitoring L

487
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:24,120
I don't that's ridiculous the good news
for you americans

488
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,649
as we don't have to do anything cuz they
just give it to the government

489
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:34,649
Facebook Twitter we don't be bothered
with that done for us yes unfortunately

490
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:35,289
although

491
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:39,750
actor has been defeated in the EU and
there is something new

492
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,919
and other doesn't specifically deal with
pornography

493
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:46,039
it deals a lot with copyright and it's
called CDA

494
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:49,509
now cedar is quite similar to actor

495
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:53,620
it's actually somewhat more restrictive
and some manners Doctors Without Borders

496
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,279
has also come out against us now the
thing about cedar is

497
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:02,139
they're trying to push it in the EU with
a commission

498
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:05,259
not elected not Parliament no

499
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:08,850
nothing to do with judicial review in
this is how they're trying to circumvent

500
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,220
the fact that the European Union said

501
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,639
no to actor so

502
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:19,190
what can be done with all of this
censorship

503
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,559
well we have a few ideas which er only
opinions

504
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,970
I'm we believe in transparency we think
that

505
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,149
a if you have a blacklist you should be

506
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:33,090
a able to view it see what's on it and
if you're put on their inadvertently

507
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,450
just like a Queensland dentist was
placed on the Australian blacklist

508
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,519
I guess because that they thought that
that dental surgery was a little too

509
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,330
saucy

510
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:45,980
I'm not sure Oro I

511
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,039
um

512
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,200
censorship shouldn't be based on
someone's opinion

513
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,590
up for example be headed the ACMA has a
highly religious man who does not

514
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,070
believe in pornography

515
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:02,610
February 2012 they came out with a
report specifying that their top goal

516
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:03,149
was

517
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:06,590
actually to block uncensored legal

518
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:11,909
adult pornography so it should really be
based on

519
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:15,580
on what our representatives and what we
say

520
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,320
and what a judge says but not somebody's
opinion that is not elected

521
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:25,200
and outside judicial review information
technology professional should be

522
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,309
consulted

523
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:29,490
a for example Bruce Schneier

524
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:34,730
a perhaps should not have been
disinvited from at the Senate meeting

525
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:38,360
a we need people who no more

526
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,750
then the internet has made up a choose
before they start changing our internet

527
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:48,029
from this was a suggestion from a block

528
00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:51,139
a from BRR

529
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:56,009
ITT I dot com transparency about black
listen censorship methods used by

530
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:57,919
businesses would be nice to you

531
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,440
who hears ever had to be the asshole to
install a filter at a company and

532
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,779
everyone hated you after

533
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:08,289
yeah thats Sox

534
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:12,629
so we need to stay on topic what's going
on on line what's going on

535
00:33:12,629 --> 00:33:16,619
a with censorship because we need to
make sure that we protect our rights

536
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,820
in hold on to them as much as possible

537
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,379
so up here is a way that

538
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:27,820
people in the US the UK India and in the
EU can locate

539
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,408
any up there a elected or parliamentary
members

540
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:35,419
I suggest that all of us get to know who
are elected or parliamentary

541
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:38,490
up members are

542
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,659
so we stay on topic but it's not
something that someone else is going to

543
00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:42,559
do

544
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,570
it's something that we need to do

545
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,970
we also need to stay on top and get to
know organizations that are against

546
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,250
censorship

547
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,789
an r4 our basic rights human and online

548
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:58,990
such as the ACLU employees a

549
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:03,109
give good shout out to the FF within the
audience's well

550
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:08,780
in

551
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,460
the International pirate party there are
now a parties

552
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,760
in this country that have been set up

553
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,639
so please check out their website by the
way their website is hosted and I swim

554
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,069
with us

555
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:26,310
free speech provider I'm in France and
Germany the Chaos Computer Club

556
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:30,359
attack

557
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,889
and please check out the international
declaration of freedom

558
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:37,589
involving the Internet

559
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:41,040
I would be remiss if I didn't mention a

560
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,719
how to report illegal porn

561
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,310
I hear some associations that anywhere
in the world if you happen to see

562
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,899
something that looks like child
pornography

563
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:55,879
I beg you please report it a child
pornography is one of the few crimes

564
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:00,069
where the person is a real victim I is
because I want something is posted

565
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:01,359
online

566
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,040
I it's there for ever thousands of
copies are made

567
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,060
like the State Department found out when
they tried to the man from wiki leaks

568
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,910
that they hand back all this stolen
information

569
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,879
they of course had to explain to the
state department that that was quite

570
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,170
impossible

571
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,640
and this is just a brief list to make
sure that I don't break copyright nor

572
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,799
the surgical 847 it will be added on so
that

573
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:33,060
hopefully a know when sousa's

574
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:37,319
and does anyone have any further
questions on earth

575
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:44,220
comments yes

576
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:51,220
him

577
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,380
here

578
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,380
brim

579
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:03,380
him all yeah the hip

580
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:10,090
while

581
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:14,410
not more but the question is how are
they planning on building the lists

582
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:18,330
a pornography sites it actually
currently exists now if you look at

583
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,140
sites like you are a blacklist

584
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:24,129
thats a free or paid blackness they
people can download for

585
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,760
& Guardian other open source software I
mean it's actually

586
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,140
me in the upper but there's companies a
Luke are

587
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:36,069
coats semantic like hundreds of
companies just

588
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,490
trying to search and make these but

589
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,200
I mean even a simple program now can go
out

590
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,980
either Google or spider themself and
based off a point calculations are the

591
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,350
men just searching in

592
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:53,420
build an index of love what is this
relation to

593
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,910
re relationship to you as a just
searching breasts as far as medical

594
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,970
or with other words near: and I mean
that search engine now

595
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:05,320
I'm bill in the mid 90's I was very very
basic of a single database

596
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,640
and within that one day they say the
methodology do it

597
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,400
with that if you look at things like
snore

598
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,310
and some %uh the email systems which I
actually have

599
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:21,400
AI built into a two-block I N if you
just apply that same logic

600
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,210
to web searching in you can gather hits
of me or else

601
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,500
open source software like dance Guardian

602
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,890
that's doing multiple ways of handling
it

603
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:36,100
a a user's URL lists a user's

604
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:40,299
a word references within certain points
built up

605
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,950
built up these values any their flags in
real time

606
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:47,690
or block set at the last so if you have
a site like Facebook

607
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:53,050
where you may not have bad material
everywhere but you're certain groups

608
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:57,290
I mean that's that's when you want to
get more the fine green technology

609
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:01,460
and we're dealing with governments who
have trillions of dollars to waste on

610
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,170
this crap

611
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:06,260
so their resources are endless yes

612
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,570
could you

613
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,890
talk a little more about copyright
issues especially with the rising tube

614
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,330
sites and the interface with some

615
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,810
those are actually owned by companies
that are producing confident pirating

616
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,190
other companies content to market their
own content

617
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,850
in a I'll it seems to be

618
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:28,860
very much a one way to keep a

619
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,750
this certain a legal firms in business

620
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:37,309
it appears a Cueto money generating

621
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:40,480
item a I must stress is actually

622
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,539
for my lawyer must say that this is
actually not my area

623
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:50,940
expertise so okay so what we have now
are things like Hulu

624
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,220
Danielle you too and it all of these
companies

625
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,930
paramount the MRI they are releasing
their own

626
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,470
on information trailers videos and
people

627
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,819
take em mash mott sending out to other
sites while

628
00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:09,509
they hire companies to search use
algorithms

629
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:12,700
and actually search for media based off
a I

630
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,099
different algorithms which they are
differences pattern there's been many

631
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:16,749
times were

632
00:39:16,749 --> 00:39:21,690
artists themselves have gotten DMCA
violations

633
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:25,410
because our what they posted and their
the owner

634
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:29,859
and their label on Sat but because these
third parties was talking we're

635
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:31,619
specifically about the adult sites

636
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,999
okay where some the adult sites are
actually owned by

637
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:38,200
pornography companies mmm I'm I

638
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,450
do you have any and since you're talking
about the dole industry

639
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:47,329
well I mean we've all seen aggregator
sites like the TDP sites where

640
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:50,859
it's just nonstop clicking their taking
other people's content so

641
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:54,670
I N I don't think it's a bad thing to
have large

642
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,849
pornography conglomerates I mean we need
someone

643
00:39:57,849 --> 00:40:01,259
to put out to do the legal tracks so

644
00:40:01,259 --> 00:40:04,720
aggregators they're just and for a penny
a click

645
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,309
so that's where real problem comes they
are stealing

646
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:12,829
content to say which is must be behind a
paywall

647
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:17,109
and look at look at an IB dot com in all
those where

648
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:21,069
people stealing often pay sites in just
posting their so

649
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:25,259
copyright does definitely come into play
this this is someone's

650
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:30,400
real livelihood and I'm not saying we
should be totally against copyright

651
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,940
I just don't want it to be for 75 years
vintage porn not that bad

652
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,890
occurred okay so

653
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,410
them related to what you're talking
about earlier that 7

654
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:48,558
well you talking about people read into
everything

655
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:52,210
step and then the big companies bisbee

656
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:55,279
crawling content for

657
00:40:55,279 --> 00:40:59,690
for stuff that they own the copyright to

658
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,869
dead and taking them for years because
I've a.m.

659
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:06,059
and the legal soundtrack

660
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:09,690
I'm just wondering we get to a point
where there there's some other stuff

661
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,809
going on against transformative work at
other kinds

662
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:15,859
because another great big don't love
affair

663
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:20,609
at porn on the internet as far as I'm
concerned is Seth m thick

664
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:24,089
it may not be widely known that we were
talking about

665
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:27,430
its just before fifty Shades of Grey
started life

666
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:32,180
as a Twilight fan fiction yeah they just
changed the names

667
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,220
and a stolen Thomas entirely from and
racers

668
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:40,849
Sleeping Beauty seriously 84 there

669
00:41:40,849 --> 00:41:45,569
there's no original work in literature
things like that so we definitely do see

670
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:49,460
lawsuits based around the main content
and books and publishing

671
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,920
that's been going on for almost 200
years SAR

672
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,140
I N if anything it's just going to get
worse now that

673
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,808
something like fifty Shades has taken
off so bigger Twilight's taken off so

674
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:00,400
big

675
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,910
I mean are we probably going to see a
better

676
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:09,149
love story then Twilight know it's crap
by it

677
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:13,349
in is so large that that's why everyone
references it to you

678
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:16,730
in as pretty much stolen from other
people in the past

679
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:22,119
but they might have not gone as big so
we're really on a down home at all

680
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:25,549
with much this we can just hope that
certain johner certain

681
00:42:25,549 --> 00:42:30,869
material doesn't get too big how we can
actually keep it in the

682
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:34,200
in our own domain or do things somewhere
with it

683
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,329
just a quick comment on the GOP a

684
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:42,920
and the weight thing on or in addition I
if you get caught it set out

685
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,180
at last I checked 15 years in prison so
missile

686
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,390
it's it's pretty bad have a new

687
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,618
a few years ago there was a protest in
ethiopia

688
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:56,769
and the police force opened fire with
live round bullets

689
00:42:56,769 --> 00:43:00,440
when the international media ask them
why they opened fire on their own

690
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,900
citizens they said

691
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:07,259
listen worse a poor country and we can't
afford record bullets

692
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:12,489
exactly so these are not too

693
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:17,339
and even that countries that you want to
get on the list

694
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:21,109
yes at the beginning at the time argue
we're mentioning how

695
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:25,720
adult material head are pushed
technology forward in waterways

696
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,910
what do you see as future arm

697
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:33,480
technology jumps because if the adult
industry

698
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,180
in the recent future I definitely see
things like salt state

699
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:41,118
as huge advancements when you look at

700
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,339
at PCIe base at solid-state

701
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:48,630
like the i/o drive I mean yes some
larger companies have used in

702
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:52,420
not that it matters cuz myspace about
one for every single server but then I

703
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,950
can be around much longer but

704
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:57,109
a lot of porn companies are starting to
do that on their

705
00:43:57,109 --> 00:44:00,950
proxy servers especially Squid proxy
servers because if you can serve

706
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:05,480
your static content of apps on state
which is not just the salts the desk

707
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,710
going over and I L controller

708
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:12,900
but straight from the PCIe bias which is
much faster

709
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,000
I mean that has been a huge advancement
in the porn technologies

710
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,960
now we're also looking at other similar
San vendors

711
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,029
doing things like hyper dagger gets with
solid-state

712
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:27,480
and up cheaper drives like

713
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,650
say to within the same rates at within
the same pool

714
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:35,359
and more intelligent caching algorithms
where

715
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,119
they'll know which blocks are hot I'm
we're also looking a lot

716
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,359
at d2 techno deduplication technology is
which are better

717
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,098
have more granular levels for Cain

718
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:51,029
levels in smaller which candy duplicate
the actual files

719
00:44:51,029 --> 00:44:54,690
even if they're encrypt it are similarly
encrypt did

720
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:58,190
be and that relates to it last orange be
needed

721
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:01,489
so that is something that certainly is a

722
00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:06,989
very recent years advancement I'm but we
are still seen some advancements in

723
00:45:06,989 --> 00:45:10,619
things like we an acceleration and
actual backbones

724
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:14,289
I I love internet and providers

725
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:18,239
you might hear some statistics that
YouTube and Netflix

726
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:21,640
are some of the highest band with sites
in the world

727
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,900
but it's not really true if you look at
all of the porn sites put together

728
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,890
together it totally trumps Google

729
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:34,038
Netflix YouTube like x hamster for
example

730
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:38,509
he says something like twenty nine
petabytes data and a

731
00:45:38,509 --> 00:45:42,450
and about 7 percent a the world's
internet users

732
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:46,299
actually visit x hampster so

733
00:45:46,299 --> 00:45:50,559
so we're we're definitely seeing in
advancements and total throughput person

734
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:52,460
can have

735
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:57,019
40 and 100 gay he in finna band has just
been growing like crazy

736
00:45:57,019 --> 00:46:01,309
so these technologies are definitely
come in and no one wants to admit

737
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:07,609
that the porn industry is pain so much
for hardware and software

738
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:11,549
so it in your chart you mentioned about
how Apple was not allowing porn on there

739
00:46:11,549 --> 00:46:16,059
App Store arm and after seem to be going
to the future

740
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:19,719
a lot of platforms Windows after is
coming there's the internets torture

741
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:23,259
this letters maybe a little bit more
open but those companies probably not

742
00:46:23,259 --> 00:46:26,519
going to be too friendly to porn so what
do you think's gonna happen to think

743
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:31,499
usual go to alternate ill to report will
be a driver to take users

744
00:46:31,499 --> 00:46:34,589
get them through their project now I
think you think will serve see

745
00:46:34,589 --> 00:46:38,700
a slowing down a technology where like
the there may be some ways people could

746
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,390
use a

747
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:42,410
a smartphone to do for naps on in

748
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:45,509
using the accelerometer I R Jesus okay

749
00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:49,180
yeah I do think that there is like were
gonna miss out on those you noses gently

750
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,399
guided missiles

751
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,190
basically in the reason you're special
because

752
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:57,269
books like Fifty Shades of Grey Apple
has gone there

753
00:46:57,269 --> 00:47:00,599
ass kicked in the e-book market the
candle

754
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:04,119
as major leap and out celine the iPad

755
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:07,279
just four fifty shades of grey in the
past couple weeks

756
00:47:07,279 --> 00:47:11,119
I mean fifty shades have been on the
book lists for a hundred

757
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,809
and eight days so there's a significant
trend

758
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:18,029
in iPad versus Kindle sales because at
that

759
00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:22,239
or books been shared Apple's actually
getting a little bit more lenient

760
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:25,690
about what they're blocking the recently
took down the

761
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:29,349
no viruses thing on their website I am

762
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:33,440
yeah so there they're starting to admit
things they're admitting that the ad now

763
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,319
where

764
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,390
in the last month on the App Store sell
because I've that push

765
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:42,200
I love the user base they're going to
open up a little bit but it's not going

766
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:42,690
to be

767
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:46,089
absolute but there are still ways gaps
on your

768
00:47:46,089 --> 00:47:49,940
your iPad where people won't make caps
which are directly

769
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,940
content holders if you look at many in

770
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:56,730
up the applications are application
development toolkits

771
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:01,489
sort of like ap salaried or titanium for
making naps on every single device

772
00:48:01,489 --> 00:48:05,410
are within one program your scene ways
that you can make a

773
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:10,170
container program so to speak which will
display your content which will

774
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:15,319
show your location and if you do things
like coaster content outside of their

775
00:48:15,319 --> 00:48:16,569
store

776
00:48:16,569 --> 00:48:20,269
I mean you have you have a lot better
chance of getting your app approved

777
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:23,910
their is I can remember the name right
now maybe someone else will be able to

778
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:24,529
remember in

779
00:48:24,529 --> 00:48:27,819
shouted out but pink something for

780
00:48:27,819 --> 00:48:31,329

786
00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:54,328

html5

793
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,839
and been able to use not just in

794
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:23,000
objective-c but these I abstraction
layer programming languages like

795
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,739

that and because at the legal battles

803
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:45,589

804
00:49:45,589 --> 00:49:48,849

apple products have been pulled off the

806
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,440
shelves

807

809
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,959
I but they do not allow a smaller
organizations or companies

810
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:10,680
that have similar content are to be sold
on their devices

811
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,739

812

822
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:59,650

law that

823
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:04,100
home wanted to limit arm poor web sites
to the died xxx

824
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:08,960
I'm domain and so is can ask you guys if
he had anything to say as our

825
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,970
how that would affect the porn industry
and yes

826
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:16,120
the law would never pass like if point
the porn business has like enough

827
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:20,450
lobbied to you you know there there's
just too much which can be considered

828
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,010
porn to make that happen

829
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:26,330
that's like say National Geographic
should be labeled as playboy

830
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,540
you know here for sought its National
Geographic

mean I might be a good idea

833
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:39,860
may help the filter companies but it's
not going to happen I

834
