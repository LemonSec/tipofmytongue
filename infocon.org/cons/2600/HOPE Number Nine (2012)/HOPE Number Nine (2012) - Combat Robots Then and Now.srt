1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,560
my name is an anomalous and I'm a
professional about come back referee

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,689
we're going to be talking about
professional more about comments or as

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,830
professional as it gets

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,010
where with Roma games and come ons we r

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,519
the only large-scale robot combat
competition you mean

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,730
not United States at the moment am

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,410
and this is Michael work david gergen
since the commission from the Roma

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,689
League so we're gonna talk a little bit
about history

9
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,740
love the spark arms and ceremonies

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,219
you know that i'm too big to be up to
date for those are you don't know

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,649
anything about combat robots

12
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:37,190
on and then through including today as
well as some pointers for those of you

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,800
who might be interested in building

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,800
hear about up

15
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,160
them there you know there like

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:56,160
hisham alright most keep 'em

17
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:03,289
first time we have Robot Wars way back
in the days anyone familiar with her

18
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:04,000
about yours

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,890
we have bright spots on so I can barely
see it yet make noise a clapper

20
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,920
something we're used to lower bearing
down and better

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,760
again so and Robot Wars was

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,530
giving them a little bit about are about
words which was founded by I'm

23
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,520
on industrial light magic employees mark
Corp who

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,990
unlike a lot of tankers was tinkering in
his house and long before rumors were

25
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,939
available to

26
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:31,890
vacuum your house I'm mark tried to
remote control

27
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,979
vacuum cleaner well he didn't wired
properly and so

28
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:39,400
what happened was was that the vacuum
cleaner caught on fire and exploded

29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,729
in his house on fire department and call
them above the law on

30
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:46,399
and so he put out the fire in and he's
destroyed his vacuum cleaners remote

31
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,970
control everything and any sleep you
know

32
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,970
should be kinda fun what if a whole
buncha

33
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,360
a vice-like did this so much violence
together

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,479
a and they built robots arm

35
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,189
to bash the crap out of each other in
the early days most of them were fran

36
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,240
has purposes

37
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,880
a remote control cars on the probably
weren't much bigger than about 50 pounds

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,800
they had very little to work very little
drive on but they were

39
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,920
there is a pretty cool an exciton for
those of you who start companies are

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,750
doing anything

41
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,810
I'm in any kind of hack trainer checked
tinkering I'm as I'm sure you all know

42
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,629
sooner or later

43
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:27,399
lawyers get involved and so the lawyers
got involved with her about workers in

44
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,629
one of his investors who

45
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:32,579
only invested ten percent above the
company's worth on but he was a million

46
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,410
a remark was in

47
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,980
I ended up in suits I'm in several hours
moved to the United Kingdom

48
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,310
which is why for the first four years
was here in the US and then after that

49
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,930
it be moved to the UK up

50
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,000
after that came battle but most
Americans know

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,129
love for about fighting dude about
what's on will who is for those who use

52
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,090
to watch bad about some companies
controlled

53
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,160
up so

54
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,720
badavatz on came about because to love
the Robot Wars contestants

55
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,030
who became junkies 2 to robotics on

56
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,300
did not want to see the sport move
across the ocean and lose the sport

57
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,440
one of those two attorney Rusty was

58
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,800
a sign at a billionaire deuce ruski who
owns most Los Angeles him the LA Kings

59
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,819
um the Wells Fargo building blots real
estate properties on the world

60
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:25,540
so they could put up the money and
they've they started robot wars and

61
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,109
because

62
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,049
love his dad sporting contacts with
various news organizations on

63
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:33,480
they were able to

64
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,720
put through a battle bot onto Comedy
Central and that was where

65
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,349
I'm although you know cool things happen
that most Americans came

66
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:46,019
to no as far as about but and real
competition germ

67
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,780
i will then do lawsuits in home for good
lawyers involved with about a bunch of

68
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,150
their

69
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,250
well about that time um came about the
RFL the robot fighting league which was

70
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,489
basically im

71
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,640
robot junkies who just said well this is
too much fun

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,580
to let it go on and so you not on TV
anymore we're gonna found fine

73
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,330
found a group will call the RFL and

74
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,159
everybody can use the rule sets come
like baseball on that is here's the

75
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,700
rules

76
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,320
and if you wanna start an event
uncertain event and then people come in

77
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,409
and fight robots

78
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,949
and so in the beginning there were Cup
big competitions with robots up to 340

79
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:23,639
pounds

80
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,250
in Los Angeles San Francisco

81
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,430
to have them in Minnesota one of them in
Florida one of them in North Carolina

82
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,229
another new york on not remember with
all these events they're all done on a

83
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:39,840
shoestring by people who really really
like to smash things and other things

84
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,080
so a lot of the shows were a little get
em but they were super fine

85
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,500
summer real ghetto something really for
example this is a visit these some

86
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,090
photos from

87
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,570
a bed event called battle beechwood
which occurred in Florida

88
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,800
and there are only few robots that
showed up and most of them were really

89
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,639
large and it was really fun and

90
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,690
the stage was religion he was built on a
theater stage

91
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,460
out of plywood and maybe some legs and
it was absolutely terrifying

92
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,940
to watch these are about to crash into
each other on the stage because they won

93
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,449
a lottery but they would do things

94
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:12,759
Lake put large appliances in the arena

95
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,100
so that the uppermost corner photograph
is on the refrigerator

96
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,210
being beaten to death by a by robot one
other things that

97
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,479
the TV doesn't show and this is true
pennies per any watching TV

98
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,590
on is just how much better does in real
life and

99
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,530
when you put to 220-pound rebuts that
are their profession design an arena

100
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,530
most people really don't know realized
just how powerful

101
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,710
those robots are also a lot bigger than
you think they're

102
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,888
their huge on so wanna things that the
arena's

103
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,889
needs to be is is very very durable to
protect the audience

104
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:49,410
we had innumerable stories love
reporters

105
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,430
anti people who I want to be in a in the
arena during the fighting like no that's

106
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,789
not possible by

107
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:58,539
night no no no no actually had a journal
journalist site

108
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:02,560
I'm were correspondents like I know what
I'm getting into an Islamic

109
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,190
up you really don't understand you play
mom against and she was getting all your

110
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,780
inner anglers it was a giant

111
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,789
disaster and then she sa match and she
understood and said I don't need to go

112
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:12,180
in there

113
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,470
a muscle there abouts are quite capable
and do on

114
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,479
the put on inch to inch long

115
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,620
holes through our one inch thick steel
the

116
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,000
that surrounds the whole arena and so
when you see we call them can openers

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,199
because it looks just like an
old-fashioned tunic and she opened up

118
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,569
on any CDs to you can roles love one
each text you like Wow

119
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:36,580
this is real the did the power of these
things is is undeniable

120
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,990
and so as even branched out but a lot of
people noticed

121
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,169
things about putting on shows that may
be a pure gearhead miners like for

122
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:45,830
example

123
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,000
it's really hard and there's marketing
involved and it's not just a case if you

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,289
build it they will come

125
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:54,500
i'm for example a previous like there
was a guy in a lower corner was raining

126
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,630
and he's wearing a

127
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,080
consider armor yet that was the extent
of their marketing

128
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,659
that that guy waiting on the road to
carry a banner ad and values way he

129
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,660
wasn't passing out fliers

130
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,569
he wasn't no email blasts you know your
newspaper ads

131
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:12,130
I'm and with Israel robot show or
something like hope

132
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,479
I mean people who attend have no idea
how much work goes into it

133
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,699
it's really a full time job so I mean
just as the people who throw on hope

134
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:23,509
I don't think they get anywhere near
enough credit so I mean thank you hope

135
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,099
for just putting on a show and he
doesn't know how

136
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:30,289
how much takes to put on a show

137
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:32,849
when it when pic when people call us up
and say hey wanna put on a road about

138
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:35,599
choking me israel's on-again rule sets
open its its

139
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,130
cut Creative Commons for for use by the
way don't put on a show it sucks

140
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,710
on yeah and ended the irony is that that
particular show in florida was during

141
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,940
Bike Week

142
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,069
in Daytona Beach perfect audience

143
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:51,090
but they're not gonna come no one knows
about it so

144
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,680
I'm so in 2005 restarted the combat Cup

145
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,610
utmost to the builders and muscle her
partner 100 kilogram

146
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,539
220 pounder abouts at typical
heavyweight which is

147
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:06,300
the 100 kilogram class robot cost
between three to ten thousand dollars to

148
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,780
build

149
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,970
on in between your armor the

150
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,740
internal frame all the electronics all
the motors the curing the weapon system

151
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,699
et cetera

152
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,090
the batteries and battery chargers on
and generally that's her second robot is

153
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:19,599
is

154
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,560
three to ten thousand dollars your first
one tends to be twenty thousand dollars

155
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,050
because you pay a lot in mistakes which
is to say

156
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,759
you you cut out this this titanium plate
for you armor and then you realize you

157
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,890
cut it on and or you could bottle the
end really expensive component any don't

158
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,529
make weight

159
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,909
so you can actually buy you by speaking
drillers new bottom-up

160
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:41,319
so that there there is an expense to it
um but it is not an insurmountable so

161
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,500
expense so the commas Cup was true word
all the people have been building robots

162
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,149
in competing robots over the previous 10
years

163
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:51,690
outsider television where there was no
money involved in it and so we offer up

164
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,779
a ten thousand dollar cash prize to the
the winning robot

165
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:59,680
and we went from a typical roster about
eight or nine

166
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,100
heavyweight robots and an event 225
robots and this was after the TV show

167
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,810
had finished

168
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,040
so a lot of people had been in
retirement tonight

169
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,370
there's nothing like a good plan on
television what have you you have read

170
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,660
the press but boy howdy

171
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,680
people ever come out of the woodwork so
we had veterans coming out it was really

172
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,370
nice to

173
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,700
have everyone come together and you know

174
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,110
and we we have a shirt little the video
were gonna show you on what is happening

175
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,100
so now it looks like now in today on and
most this isn't just the fighting it's

176
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,019
really a lot over

177
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,190
interviews with the builders and since
everybody at Hope

178
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,370
I presume to be is is one of those
people who wants to learn how to build

179
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,440
one of these robots

180
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,990
this particular videos focusing more on
the contestants the National the fights

181
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:49,990
give I'm

182
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,270
so our team name is Tim robotics

183
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,710
because his own as well care products

184
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,070
both partner Mark board

185
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,430
me and team Scott body aches

186
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:28,810
robots raging scotsman I am right knee
in the learner

187
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,639
my I think strategy is to impale other
about how to play guitar 20 speak with

188
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,449
of bang in front of robot

189
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:40,250
robot very fast and powerful I think
I've ever made him laugh

190
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,720
or at them famous from Tampa Florida

191
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,279
I am about it so about name were I've
heard in the

192
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,560
robot is a my senior designed by Jeff on
my name is Ray billings

193
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,519
Tom from El Dorado Hills three is
responsible for putting my

194
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,980
engineering and robotics I've got two
heavyweight class robots today I have

195
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,370
last rights which

196
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:07,389
is a big horizontal spinner I won the
combat Cup two years ago with it and I'm

197
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:12,350
open to regain the title this year my
name is Mike and she really wants

198
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,120
I am we are from T&T its base data

199
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,139
Oakland Calif and the heavyweight robot

200
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,720
his name pine box well into bills not
about religion is like everyone chill

201
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,750
high schools and what is cheap bastard
on easy and a mixed most splinters

202
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,290
my name's Matt maxam from sacramento
california

203
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:37,120
are team is team one crazy man support
and rub our fight near sewer snake

204
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,399
the strategy is break their fast with my
face

205
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,940
I'm jim's Makowski

206
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,329
I'm from Florida heavyweight robot that
I brought this time is breaker box I'm

207
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:51,100
here Jen

208

is a year

210
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,180
per cup holder but and realm

211
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,589
giving in and buying just can't stop

212
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:07,720
mind Bradley cancer well this city her
out the head

213
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,649
as a result of a battle of I our team
think tank writer Pasadena Calif

214
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:20,649
double rainbow party

215
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:30,550
1

216
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,130
that's their little arena for the little
and when the leads there one in three

217
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,010
pound robust

218
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:40,490
at Lego Summa that's our floor 5 great

219
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,870
honeys I want without laughing my ass is
a long time enabling

220
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,890
the dentist apt 201 along with falls on

221
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,910
spinning bar the app she beat me like
many many matches

222
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,870
last right of that family just midwives
me she

223
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,160
tears and a row wily veteran well home
she believes one in the morning so that

224
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,170
the present problems

225
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,540
and the other side we have pine box in
the sheeple

226
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,730
black coffin any you positioning

227
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,720
yeah im they would have they were very
secretive they wouldn't let anybody

228
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,020
knows that this is gonna be a surprise
to them

229
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,160
I think it's all me doubt me jury Gary

230
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,350
she respond worth it have tiny

231
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,770
patsy and on known about it

232
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,140
kinda just yeah I'd what do I have to be
our greatest

233
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,550
don't like you run the gamut from me
very hard even understood you've left

234
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,050
the church and just legal motions with
his

235
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,330
only knows what's in the box and Raymond
didn't in them

236
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,350
they all worried about the unknown you
know you talked about people that

237
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,040
basically someone who wanted

238
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,599
you know you don't know what that others
don't supplies were so does the side

239
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,640
agreements are you re nothing happened
that while external as I like challenges

240
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,540
haha

241
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:58,160
is a big horizontal spinner I won the
combat Cup two years ago with it and I'm

242
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,040
hoping to regain the title this year the
robot was supposed to be

243
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,060
understated surprise for this search
that

244
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:11,470
forget the name simple and unobtrusive
and to be the combat Cup winner is a big

245
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,070
deal

246
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,520
and because I wanna before I know how
big a deal with it so I'm

247
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,430
I'm really gonna play again today on
last night's

248
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,710
I have two different weapon marcia have
a a solid tools

249
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:27,940
11 Mar and I have a a aluminum bar that
has tools kill people yeah

250
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,090
and I I very which weapon I use
depending upon the comment that I'm

251
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:33,730
facing

252
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,230
well definitely about Las rights we had
always talked about

253
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,070
sneaking a fifty-pound and though into
the car of Indian something to chew on

254
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:49,070
but didn't make weight for that

255
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,139
you left ready just let the
concentration honorees

256
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:58,940
me good regard

257
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,120
year is taken time with his weapon me
happiness

258
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,899
opening the on bbm rate for Henry zg5

259
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:13,920
got to do with weapons haven't on
dracula

260
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,399
I would go with bombing growling

261
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,699
good face

262
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:28,699
absolutely beautiful face now shots gone

263
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,129
good her the arena

264
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:40,129
no right after this jury gonna Tabata
sure when gone out a baby

265
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,319
go okay

266
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:48,069
it have no

267
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:51,660
it's not a cap on all pine box can be

268
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,160
you have children special motion right
now is to

269
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,829
bill a me chest fellini

270
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:03,110
play pretty much just moving to play
around

271
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,829
banning all splinter is the data here
plant with a plan on blowing all the

272
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:08,639
dirt on the way

273
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,579
well does that was a cute and
interesting match it's gonna be modded

274
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:16,519
our for them to clean all the stuff up
means I P

275
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,629
the match or last rites that's right

276
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:25,300
behind a where box it was entertaining
everybody

277
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,949
not campaigning in it ap Lang beautiful

278
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:31,959
for be up alone with zombie personally
prefer

279
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:35,680
house least up light shine my shoes

280
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,709
from this house national ledger yeah

281
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:45,199
com

282
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,990
so yet that was that was an example have
fun and exciting and very very short

283
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,120
match but am

284
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,800
yet chewy heady powerchair underneath
the coffin it was essentially a big hit

285
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,040
the electric wheelchair

286
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,930
and at another step on to it in his job
but his work

287
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,260
and you know at a different server mine
as its cool

288
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,990
yeah so this is white people tend to do
it although

289
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,650
I would guess that to this credit be
fairly self-explanatory laid wanna

290
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,480
build a reminder like am I miss your
lover not a fighter

291
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,990
I am but yet the main thing you know if
you can I do it is because

292
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,209
it's a really great way to trick people
into learning math and science and

293
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:23,860
engineering

294
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,500
because when a kid has a robot in their
hands and they need to figure out

295
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,520
this thing over here but they know these
two other things and they use these two

296
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,480
other things too

297
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,220
figure out this thing about their
electronics or what have you Bravo

298
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,700
algebra busy a.m.

299
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,230
its real-world engineering and so
whether you're an adult who wants to do

300
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,470
a rickety wants to do it

301
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,610
the it forces you know to

302
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,130
to learn all sorts of things everything
from you know the physics

303
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,740
and the how to weld how to do basic
electronics

304
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,429
on how to do programming I'm a lot other
amounts to have some I in time in terms

305
00:17:58,429 --> 00:17:59,470
weapon systems

306
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,600
on and some other builders action may
call their own on electronics for the

307
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,809
for the control systems

308
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:09,070
and and there is an interesting thing
about the sport that happens when people

309
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,120
come to a show

310
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,490
on not just watching here in two
neighboring actually come to a show

311
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,320
is about ninety a person in the crowd
goes wild I was really cool

312
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,309
on and you know and I became an on the
go home and they go about their business

313
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:21,190
I'm

314
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,360
about 2 percent it be really does change
your life like like

315
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,580
a lot of things in life there's you're
missing something in your soul in this

316
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:29,980
is

317
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,039
you're looking for that thing on I was

318
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,890
a professional computer programmer doing
e-commerce web sites

319
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,049
in 2001 battle but asked me to come
judge for their show on a minor

320
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:45,360
alright adulthood and we lurk and I sent
my judge their

321
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,419
fell about season 3 and and go to manage
time as a

322
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,140
running the door and it literally
changed our lives I'm

323
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,120
because here I was a very happily you
know paid e-commerce web master

324
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,780
on who had lots of disposable income and
wasn't doing anything with it

325
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,230
and then you see this year like oh my
god I wanted to do this and everybody

326
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,880
who

327
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,539
who's on there i mean they don't do it
for the money there's no money in a

328
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:08,030
sport

329
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,559
with him at a house by now several
earlier over at the the combat arena

330
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,710
that we use as a four hundred thousand
dollar

331
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,720
combat arena the polycarbonate the and
cold in close it I'm is a hundred twenty

332
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,320
thousand dollars just for the polly

333
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,230
on and it is an interesting thing I mean
lemon the audience

334
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,720
comes out the shows every year from
Japan town where he lives to see this

335
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,850
because it's just

336
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,649
it's the most spectacular engaging thing
the

337
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:34,919
accretive engineering mindset can ever
see or do

338
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,130
we've had several people over the years
say that is

339
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,480
actually addictive because its you know

340
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,340
there's a lot of failure it's a lot of
failure it is like a drug that I mean

341
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,428
you try to get out

342
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:49,919
um and you're just like okay and on and
on and on ships no I'm not in the fall

343
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:50,360
of

344
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,530
and and you go back to doing it yeah are
little touched on that we have an

345
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,139
agreement

346
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:58,460
israeli tear each other and I am never
doing this again

347
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,760
this sucks mixture is Kim still

348
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,940
well must I'm everybody does it

349
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,909
there's no I mean when we talk to
sponsors in TV people on one other I was

350
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:11,460
like what your demographic and like we
don't have one more common with your

351
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,770
demographic it's like you know

352
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,260
little kids to do it and meatball
retirees you do at middle age people and

353
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,860
young people

354
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,799
our youngest combat driver is 8 min and
our oldest is what

355
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,870
somebody is 16 on selling a 72-year-old
i'd i'd

356
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,960
the but you know the careers

357
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,889
on my doctor my internal medicine doctor
is my doctor

358
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:35,440
because he's a contestant here's a guy
he works

359
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,040
in internal medicine on and

360
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,720
he comes over shows any menu now instead
of you know the doctor on the weekend he

361
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,710
doesn't sit around and watch TV or go
fishing

362
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,559
he builds combat robots with his son has
been driving since the lead he was 11

363
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,500
and is now going to college on
engineering scholarship

364
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,540
because he's been doing this for some
time so the basics in a combat robot

365
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,879
for those who've never built this kind
ever before on

366
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,750
body which is a free man in armour they
tend to be

367
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,899
divisible in the same way that the car
years is that really if you look at the

368
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:07,899
quarter panels inside house in your car

369
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:12,149
you can remove all them in the freemen
remains so in an accident

370
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:15,559
on if you're just digging up although
the side panels that you can replace

371
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:16,110
those

372
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,690
the frame is what really makes the car

373
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,720
the drivetrain are meant for those who
you never done any kind

374
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,580
electromechanical devices

375
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,549
a motors do not stand by themselves yes
you need to hear them down they tend to

376
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:29,990
be much too fast

377
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,190
and was too little to work so typically
you using your box

378
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,419
or several chains and sprockets to your
the

379
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:40,149
the motor down before you finally have
the wheels or the tragic election

380
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:41,409
everything

381
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:46,350
and finally the electronics arm anybody
here know in each bridges

382
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,330
couple people on anybody know what an
electronic speed controllers

383
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,710
so any SC is a much more advanced
h-bridge

384
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,120
which basically allows digital
proportional control

385
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,980
the robot so an h-bridge traditionally
is just on of forward or backwards

386
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,090
I'm is needed personal control Rs speed
controller

387
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,260
is what makes the robot go slow medium
fast

388
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,620
it is also the most fragile component a
other about

389
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,649
and then finally the receiver and
control mechanism

390
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:16,889
a and of course the weapons

391
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:20,130
and this all looks really really simple
to someone who's mess around with

392
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,780
hardware and software and what have you
but

393
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,490
it's really easy to put together it's
really hard to put together well

394
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,110
so I'm there's a lot of things you have
to keep in mind

395
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,320
there's there's no kids that you can buy
online that are worth buying also that

396
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,090
on there there are some kids that you
can buy I advise against buying any kids

397
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,010
online cuz because none of them are good
enough quality

398
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,179
for the price you paid her couple like
four thousand dollar kits which are

399
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:45,330
reasonably good quality

400
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,320
by from a novice can probably bill that
same kit for about

401
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,629
fifteen hundred dollars for on you
really

402
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,139
very close friend of mine who is a
professional engineer

403
00:22:56,139 --> 00:23:00,059
just enter the the last competition on
named David

404
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,639
and I told them you know you know you if
you wanna do this it's going to cost you

405
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:04,919
about five or ten thousand dollars

406
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,600
at that weight class conditional
220-pounder about is like no no no

407
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,840
on spartan you know talented like to do
is make dude it's just

408
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,699
you just on which getting into and so
has 120 pound robot

409
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,130
as he was finishing it ended up being a
118 pounds without

410
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:23,020
any armor and without any weapon system
so immediately jump himself

411
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,179
up for that same robot into the
220-pound category

412
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:31,030
and I think you find the costed out in
about ten thousand dollars

413
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:34,200
on the classes just f.y.i I'm

414
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,139
we tend to focus on the 220-pound weight
class cuz big glamorous

415
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:42,380
cool class but these are the different
classes there's a $5 Graham class

416
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,880
for the really hardcore Electronics
Engineers wanna make something tiny

417
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,320
it's a very hard class to compete in 21
pound

418
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,770
three-pound sixties 120 is and 2 20's

419
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,830
and so just like boxing on if you have a
sixty-pound robot

420
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,918
you can compete in the 60-pound class or
if you want 220-pounder 220-pound just

421
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,020
not be 61 ponder about compete in a
sixty

422
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,149
and you don't have to max out on your
way to their 220-pounder about

423
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:12,240
competitors way in its a two hundred
pounds

424
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,379
some people do it on purpose for
strategic reasons and I'm not clear for

425
00:24:15,379 --> 00:24:16,429
your first robot

426
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:19,629
on there's a video that I won't show
because it's too long I did when I was a

427
00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:24,190
a former professor I've robotics I'm you
can just give you my last name

428
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:28,360
robots on YouTube you'll find it a but
you can build a very basic robot

429
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,929
for a couple hundred bucks on stuff that
you can get at her for free

430
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:35,690
quite literally so a drill motor
actually gives you most the components

431
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:39,669
you need to because a drill motor has
the batteries in the battery chargers

432
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:43,059
which are some the most expensive
components and the motors with the

433
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:44,700
attached gearboxes so there

434
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,520
they look like a single component when
you when you take apart a grilled the

435
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,050
pressure to separate components

436
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,580
on and you can get dirt cheap starter
the

437
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,990
Joe motors for about 30 bucks that will
work in a sixty-pound class robot

438
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,500
I'm you need a cheap speed controller on
and cheap

439
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,179
is about to enter bucks is cheap you're
gonna get anything less than that

440
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:07,940
you're just gonna burn out and you have
to buy another one and another one and

441
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,480
another one

442
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,629
so don't buy anything less than two min
and speaking drillers the

443
00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:15,649
first things to go every single time
wanna that you want tulip

444
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:18,679
them oh yes own people know

445
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:21,809
about the mysterious and magical magic
smoke am

446
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:26,520
whenever a bottom it's magic smoke it
really really really bad so whenever

447
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,710
something start smoking in the Renard
announcers got that was cuz

448
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,790
i'll know he's lost its magic smoke

449
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,100
what are we gonna do you own and then we
carried out to the tarmac and put it out

450
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,580
magic smoke is what what actually powers
the robot you have to keep it inside if

451
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,879
your electronic components at all times

452
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:45,230
really bad if it if it escapes then you
have no more power

453
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:48,309
the robot got his as here ESET get that
you have to

454
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:51,149
you have to you know sacrifice
accomplice be controllers to her before

455
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,090
your

456
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,790
and I've been doing this for over 10
years now and i still blow shit up

457
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:59,210
ministers read a passage

458
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,559
so weapon evolution um this is what most
people like this

459
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,559
%um when your about or started I don't
have anyone has a fracture had ever

460
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:09,149
actually gone to Robot Wars way back in
the day like 95 96

461
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:13,059
am there was like huge arrays have
different kinds weapons or

462
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:17,379
no balls and chains and mazes pocketbook
syndrome motors and they're all really

463
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:21,119
Cuban artist again fun totally
ineffective totally in a better look

464
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,409
even today mine

465
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:26,730
people who will come with like um a
circular saw mounted on the front other

466
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,960
analysis can be so greatly eat all the
other reno's in matters like I wanna

467
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,190
you you're not fighting robots that are
made of wood

468
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:37,799
you're not fighting teddy bears you're
not fighting robots that standstill the

469
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,510
other guys trying very hard

470
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,600
to get behind you just the same way
you're trying to get behind him

471
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,139
so the basic design that is effective is
the pizza box on wheels with the thing

472
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:46,879
in the front

473
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:50,299
and thing takes a bunch of different
forms but essentially it's

474
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:54,309
allege and you can win with a wedge
their

475
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:57,559
drivers you can when like crazy with the
Reg but you have to know how to operate

476
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:58,470
your vehicle

477
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:02,340
a so when we say which which isn't
technically weapons not actuated it's

478
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:02,889
just it's

479
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:07,760
a shovel in front of the the robot the
rest of these weapons are all action

480
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,440
here's a lifter their mechanical they
don't turn they'll go very fast but they

481
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,290
really had to work in the ideas you'll
get underneath your money

482
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,399
you lift them up there will wrap around
your actively controlling you can drag

483
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:20,190
around the ring are put them over the
side at the member

484
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,460
if you there in the rules are being hit
between if you the floor with your

485
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,440
opponent between the bumper and the wall

486
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,040
that your point is I'm madly out and you
have won by knockout

487
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,908
this is a flipper which is generally
pneumatically powered

488
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:38,879
their really really big crowd pleaser
because they make a lot of noise and

489
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:42,240
smoke and they can do things like pearl
themselves through the air

490
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,600
and how the other about three years for
example a.m. and

491
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,500
electoral typically just literally lived
the other robot

492
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,990
and then drive around whereas a flipper
and will launch the other about

493
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,369
into the air typically into the ceiling
of the arena on

494
00:27:56,369 --> 00:27:59,879
and so the damage is done a not

495
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:03,470
from being flipped bird from coming down
the hard way I'm and then hitting the

496
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,149
floor

497
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:07,109
and you have to know what you do when
you have a nomadic Berber for obvious

498
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:10,369
reasons because pneumatic too
complicated and hard in fact this year

499
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:14,510
we had an incident in the pit where
sentencing he who is seen here

500
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,119
was filling it tank care they were there
she was feeling its tank and

501
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:22,730
the year the regulator came off and a
can of explosively and very very very

502
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,450
loudly and likely nobody was hurt
because they were

503
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,419
you know projectile objects everywhere
but it does that's why we have access to

504
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:33,419
some so so far to our knowledge nobody's
been

505
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:36,669
the critically hurt the

506
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:39,780
in their homes I'm doing this up

507
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,090
we have that that for nine thousand
dollar arena so that nobody gets hurt at

508
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,040
the event

509
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,740
but building a combat robot I mean
you're dealing with incredible

510
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:51,619
forces and so something like the Sun is
a which is that they're about the

511
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:52,649
foreground here

512
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:56,440
could very easily rip your arm of
without

513
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,320
any damage to the to provide um

514
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,580
and yeah I mean the forces again when
she come to a real show

515
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,090
are just in scenes and likely people are
pretty conscientious about safety in the

516
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:08,609
worst

517
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:12,428
injuries are medics usually see are
slices across the palm from when you go

518
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:13,530
in after year

519
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,770
matching you go underneath your about to
lift it up in there something share

520
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,990
that's been tunic and open mayor on it
and then you bleed all over the place

521
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,730
and the bill is in very high for the
medicare the Medicaid I was there is a

522
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,679
need to go to hospital

523
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,040
pitches but I have matching forty
minutes I can do that and ribbons

524
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,020
inducted bonnet column acronym

525
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,570
so right now in the bars Gunners numbers
Gunners are

526
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:38,408
really tragic UL they have a lot of
Turkana wanna physics behind them

527
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:42,000
and your horizontal and verticals
there's a last trade for G

528
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,750
that shot in the video is horizontal and
has eight hun

529
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,530
a force behind it when I hit something
spends at 5500 rpm

530
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,450
on that bar that you're seeing in this
photograph in when you saw on the video

531
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:57,290
is just under a hundred pounds must've
for muscle last rates

532
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,850
weight is in the bar by design and it's
hardened tool steel

533
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,419
which you know is hardened tool steel
it's up to me Amazona

534
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:07,710
yeah it's really really really robust
that's built to last

535
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:11,740
except for when it hits another robot
and the individual still flies often

536
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,740
hits the wall the arena and we have to
stop and make sure that everything is

537
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,659
safe in

538
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:19,940
coherent am and the other about in those
pictures: Electric Boogaloo

539
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,359
which is super awesome and built by a
kids who have been add

540
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,629
participating in the insect classes 13
pounds robots

541
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:31,250
and they made the step up to g20 this
year and major came in second they

542
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,210
definitely pay attention after years
competing in the one in three pound

543
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,109
class

544
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:39,540
they listened to all the the order
builders pharmacy order to me by age but

545
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,580
my experience may have your classes

546
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,590
and this picture was actually taken when
they had made their way through the

547
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,720
latter so you notice that other armor is
held on my zip ties if you look at all

548
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,429
those we're delighted he's coming off
the the robot those are in fact zip ties

549
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:57,119
in other full body scanner you can see
them so much in emerging their giant

550
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,179
pain in the ass

551
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:01,179
they're really awesome must be probably
know Jamie Hyneman

552
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:04,850
Mythbusters on and Jamie was with a

553
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,960
rule changer for but in the robert was
mad about Sarah

554
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,049
because he was the first one that came
up with a full body scanner which was in

555
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:13,668
at the time million to $60 pounder and
it was

556
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:17,149
a lock it was a very heavy walk
upside-down spinning

557
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:20,799
and so the concept was was well what if
the whole robot

558
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,799
is a weapon it if you look on
Mythbusters and look in the back and you

559
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,869
can actually see brando on a high shelf
in m7

560
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:32,629
and so when full body scanners came into
play as well as partners 19

561
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:36,889
and we the sport had to go from there
about where Sarah

562
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:40,639
there wasn't much between if I if somone
are the robots fighting

563
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:44,220
there wasn't much between us any you
guys the audience

564
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,790
I mean people it was very lucky that
nobody got butthurt I mean most the

565
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,720
fights where

566
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,950
in yeah week a judge in my column pillow
fights cuz it's like how you pick a

567
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,690
winner between two little robots

568
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:59,159
kinda push each other on nowadays i
meani buckets

569
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:02,840
sometimes after after fight to to pull
up all this crap

570
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,200
on its riddick Asia live had a well
before back together

571
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,990
that's always fun and this is a gem
spinner this is a really really really

572
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,619
effective weapon if you know what you
doing with it because there's a lot of

573
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:14,280
physics and other design as well

574
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,359
it's just a big German some kind and no
on integrator to their something and

575
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,409
it's been really really really fast

576
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:23,500
a team real box them 13 rebounds

577
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,070
and their driver they have they have
exclusively downstairs I have a germs

578
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,600
been every weight class and their heavy
weight is 240

579
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,780
basically a cad file just scaled down
for each across

580
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:37,149
but they have elevated the drums been
urged to a high art because

581
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:40,720
and Danielle who designed the weapon is
the main dryer

582
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,909
literally reading is writing his PhD on

583
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:47,210
how to make that the most effective
robot because the

584
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,909
I'm centripetal and centrifugal forces
applied by transparencies actually rose

585
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:52,649
peach and a copy of it

586
00:32:52,649 --> 00:32:55,960
on on the the dynamics

587
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,870
love where everything is really so that
teeth that they use

588
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,880
on the use Titanium teeth on a stainless
steel drum

589
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,679
and all and all that is in all the math
our park

590
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,570
above that and so summer these robots I
mean you look at the menu like okay its

591
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,299
budget guys

592
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:15,889
digging around in their apartments and
building robots that's not true I mean

593
00:33:15,889 --> 00:33:19,470
yes you can be your average georgine

594
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:23,120
doing it in your apartment on where your
garage and you can also be

595
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,299
on fall the it's actually for master's
program in

596
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:31,490
real and every year those guys bring
proper but thirty or forty students

597
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:35,539
up to revel games in April on to compete
in various because it actually started

598
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:36,879
coming up twice a year

599
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,340
so they can't compete a combat couple

600
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:45,779
this is a major leap in Sherman it works
on hydraulics in it

601
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:48,929
pinchers they're not

602
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:54,000
you're not the hydraulic lines are rate
open there in the boxer electronics

603
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,700
sorry everything that has been inverse
ratio between a prettier about the less

604
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,000
likely it is to win

605
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,440
yet none scrutinizing

606
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,549
this is an example the flames terror the
robot with the flames there was the

607
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:08,770
region scotsman

608
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,580
from Piedmont high school and flame
throwers are really pretty

609
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,899
am they're not particularly effective
but they make the crowd

610
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:19,888
really really really happy so they're
fun you know that the arena is

611
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:22,580
is fully contained so we had the fire
marshal is a walk through every show we

612
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,830
do in every relationship

613
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:28,840
fire marshal he loves him farmers are
Pyros I am

614
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,750
bit the thing if I'm Thursday is is we
love the fresh considering

615
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:37,210
a row modification to I'm not include
flame throwers as part of the robot wait

616
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,380
because they're so much fun

617
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,740
and they're so friggin ineffective I
mean

618
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:46,340
yes we're currently had if you wish to
cure your hand in front of a point or

619
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,370
like that you're probably gonna burn
yourself

620
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:52,210
but you badly enough that's I'm
isopropanol any problem even its third

621
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,520
degree burns probably just gonna

622
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,560
I'm get a decent second degree burn her
gorgeous but they're not very high

623
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,460
a

624
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,590
so mobility M you have your drivetrain
and you have a radio

625
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:12,040
options when it comes to how your robert
was around basic courses wheels you can

626
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,700
have four wheels he had two wheels again
have six wheels a source node pairs here

627
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:20,620
am and robots for the most part do not
move like cars in terms of steering so

628
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:25,029
cars you have met him are you have a
reckon pains during front so that your

629
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,580
front wheels on your car will

630
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:31,370
shift left early has been the original
and Iraq I'm whereas robots operate

631
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,690
essentially like tanks

632
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:36,410
it's called skins during which is to say
that one drop-side straight rain

633
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,740
operates faster or slower than the other
in order its to steer

634
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:44,020
so looking at Super Snake if Sirius Nick
wanted to continue around to the left

635
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,350
on the rates wheels just be going faster

636
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:51,270
the not left wheels and then that would
turn the robot around

637
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:54,560
left and vice versa instead eventually
turning your wheels

638
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,630
so these are making wheels if if

639
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:03,030
if regular skits during is is standards
during make them wheels are awesome

640
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,680
stern

641
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,919
arm if you've never seen a magnum robot

642
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,290
a just check your YouTube they are

643
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,930
incredibly creepy and wonderful
magnificent to watch

644
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:17,250
I'm you'll notice all those rollers
inside

645
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,480
above the wheels I may also notice you
look carefully

646
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,130
that's on there can tonight the internal
rulers are canted 90 degrees to each

647
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:25,680
other

648
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,359
on I'm I can only wonder about and
basically what that means is that the

649
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,120
robot can operate like a normal robot

650
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,259
but you can also orbit and do other
things

651
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,780
so it's really cool to watch a robot
orbit around with its nose pointed

652
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,790
directly it's creepy

653
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:43,540
I'm really creepy they had to be
psychologically going forward macros

654
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,090
like a regular about but can also
slipped to the side so if you're

655
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,500
imagining parallel parking and a pain in
the ass

656
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,410
parallel parking job is American ima
robot can actually just drive straight

657
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:52,970
up

658
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:56,540
in between two cars and then with the
flip the switch move

659
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,700
I'm ninety degrees from itself forward
access

660
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:04,690
jars covered per session

661
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:08,070
religion reservist lynda you have a
thing on the front that's been really

662
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,770
fast then you take advantage of that
inertia and

663
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,990
kinda gently urge your about where you
want to go there really needs to watch

664
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:15,900
because the

665
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,520
the rear wheels on the counter will
always be up off the ground as as a

666
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,300
process is

667
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,600
and so they're just spin up in this case
this is on

668
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,960
the beast the best a bastard and mister
a better

669
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,460
an assist from universities on and so
basically leave

670
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,610
depending on how fast and in which
direction the spin that desk

671
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,870
the the robot cans to one side or the
other

672
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:41,190
this kenneth stern also gives you the
maximum opportunity to yourself

673
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:45,810
because there's one on and remember
always Newton's law that 50 percent

674
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,460
energy goes out and 50 percent goes and
last rates which we showed you in the

675
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:49,980
beginning

676
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,600
on is as good at destroying its own
weapon systems

677
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,630
as a is destroying the other about
thousand dollars a weapon motor

678
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:02,320
know you went through four from last
time so the next thing is a cam Walker

679
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,870
Nazi camp markers very %uh furnaces a

680
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:08,160
robot called y Aki and it was from the
battle but stays

681
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,580
and you get a weight bonus for a walker
so

682
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,790
it if you look to the left to the robot
your you'll see what looks like three

683
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,220
white

684
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,470
fingers with 10 the weight fingers
closest to her about sticking out

685
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:23,140
and basically those fingers I'm are
connected to a cam

686
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:27,850
and it's kinda like a low-growing over
Derr so digital edition goes forward and

687
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:28,490
backwards

688
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:31,570
something is always on the ground at one
time but there's not actually wheels

689
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:36,590
involved any delete bonus for longer and
this is a true locker

690
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:40,010
am legislation was waiting for a yet
this is Irving bear

691
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:43,330
her name is Meghan on she's pretty and
that is actually a

692
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:46,900
a robot combat robot on and it does
compete

693
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,440
the since 440 pounds a and can walk

694
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,350
I'm like a crab but it also can much
like trade occurs and the

695
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,740
a Star Wars prequels a control up into a
little ball and rollaway

696
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:02,390
does a death row mark situacion who
built it is a special effects guy and he

697
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,220
likes to

698
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,300
used to like to enter the arena learning
in for fights by

699
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,690
writing on the back your intimidations

700
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:15,230
sigourney compete on after being in the
sport for

701
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,310
I know fourteen years no 1999 Jim

702
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:22,310
thirteen years so this is a list
compiled down

703
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,570
I used to keep I was judging I have I
don't judge anymore but I'm

704
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:30,020
other all the stupid shit the people do
and some abusers boxed in your common

705
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:33,270
sense oh my gosh why did people might
even think that because that's gross the

706
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,070
first thing I would think I've been you

707
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:38,460
other poor schmuck over there your you
know you're just not liking I certainly

708
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,560
would never do any other

709
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,120
you're on your absolutely wrong it's
like getting ready your presentation the

710
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,859
day before

711
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,790
I'm response to give it that something
like up like we did not too many of

712
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:47,490
those

713
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,820
on but doesn't work in robotics I mean
you have to be be ready

714
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,150
and so and you have to and you can't buy
the whole I'll be okay

715
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:58,100
Dorman I'm so you have to click link you
when you come to an event so

716
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,520
no you have a few hours before you have
did you have to check of all the

717
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,150
checkboxes

718
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,000
make sure that you're safe in that year
and that your call thank you right

719
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,240
you come in an era mucho on

720
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,840
be able to turn your about on and move
rate out love

721
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,800
to create whether you're will you drove
there about their reef with their you

722
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,820
ship that their

723
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,880
you should be ready to go radar the
get-go

724
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,640
I'm number to learn to fucking drive
this is one of those things where all

725
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,390
these people build their robots may
loaded into the arena for the first

726
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,109
fight

727
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:31,480
and we look coming up so much right
timing and we've never driven it before

728
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,400
I hope it will

729
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,280
the whole point here strike against the
other guy and if you don't know how to

730
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,430
operate repugnant

731
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,740
in this is real world physics is not the
video game real-world physics

732
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:45,460
is hard to control this robot because

733
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,130
you there there's motors the break
there's big spinning things are

734
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,910
stereoscopic per session

735
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,210
you need to test her about a lot and be
able to solve

736
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:57,970
right I am robots will put you over your
foot yourself over it surprisingly easy

737
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:58,540
to do

738
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,900
and the counterpart to to being able to
celebrate your robot as you also have to

739
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,250
know how to drive backwards when you
flip over because left his writing

740
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,170
writers luncheon for Zack remembers for
did you get so confused

741
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:12,530
you're going to return to perform 20 yr
um

742
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,690
simply being attacked um a lot of people

743
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,410
I build a robot and the first hit
against her about totally takes up

744
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:24,770
so much while who used to who build
robots for about a boxing

745
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:28,810
who has been really great and amazing
builder used to test his finished robot

746
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:31,430
spider writing it off the river's crash

747
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:34,700
not right up through it would land and
if he could not operate the robot after

748
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,920
that he had it

749
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,950
make it better it wasn't in on our part
property minutes old burn through this

750
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:43,090
on have a weapon system man sounds of
explanatory

751
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:46,310
I'm Ann Arbor wedge parts that have no
weapons but

752
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:49,670
assimilate attacking I mean I'm the

753
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,710
a lot of these robots when they're when
their weapons start spinning up or

754
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,330
whatever the second the touch anything
they fall apart because they're so

755
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,549
poorly built this been fine in the
garage

756
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:02,420
but again you know 50 percent forced to
go backwards into the robot

757
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,530
I'll watch matches use good batteries
mum

758
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:09,130
a lot robots are mean newbies will die

759
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,870
because I just jumping up batteries and
battery burnout arm

760
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:15,660
don't let the judge decide the match for
you it's just like boxing if you cannot

761
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,540
tell you when

762
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:20,520
if you if you have to go all 12 rounds
then the judges decide

763
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,320
and read the rules I mean we get people
to show up all the time a stupid

764
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,100
shut-ins like

765
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:29,800
you can't do that so the combat Cup is
coming up October 20th 21st

766
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,760
on that is actually the trophy it's
modeled after and will have the trip

767
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,930
itself is modeled after lady in the lake

768
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:39,220
a but on the design is modeled after

769
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,490
on the hockey trophy so that

770
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:46,250
below that trophy there's action not
which is not shown in this photo and we

771
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:50,000
on sketch and laser etch winning robots
photograph

772
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,560
and the winning team every year
thrashing out tonight come out at seven

773
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,220
and so we actually have to get the
second not I'm so it's

774
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:02,290
the just like the Stanley Cup and in
rubber games will be in April 2013

775
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:06,140
ennui if you like combat but you don't
want fighting robots

776
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,609
this an example love on the Met worse

777
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:13,240
on you tell operate these robots except
you're not allowed to look at the field

778
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,950
like regular combat on and special
effects friends are specially built

779
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:21,910
the field so those are real on a movie
qualities but as a

780
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:27,330
that buildings I'm in and basically you
should the other guy with BB guns

781
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:31,430
these are some the other events we do
River games there's robot soccer

782
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,649
assume no firefighting et cetera

783
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,960
I am this is my best friends too

784
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,540
give us all the money to do this and
tallied is passed away

785
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,290
and he'd be really annoyed that I just
know that by the way that is why

786
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,890
Microsoft engineer

787
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:52,890
and now I kinda shirt I'm so questions

788
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:56,680
he has a mic microphone urban okay

789
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:02,899
buckingham them

790
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,750
hi I'm are more than six people here

791
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:13,750
me re:

792
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:21,220
globe okay then it had not idea was

793
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:25,720
which was developed Budi go to war have
been applied to any other area

794
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,650
other than the game several several
builders email professional honest

795
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:32,960
really started a.m. where they where
they started

796
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,170
are just building not competing abouts
on when the guys just an

797
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:41,200
on I know he known builds the bomb
robots for

798
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,240
police departments and things like that
man he's done very

799
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,460
well for himself making turning
basically

800
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:51,510
untold fifteen hundred dollar about kid
on know it's awesome to

801
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:54,890
promise possible on disposal eyes for

802
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:58,690
tends about problem under two thousand
dollars um

803
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:02,620
in terms of specifics am i cant side any
but that doesn't mean that they don't

804
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,400
happen in this means I don't know about
them

805
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,490
we turn on a lot of engineers for
example image in forrest et

806
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:09,870
in the beginning he's going in
engineering school because he's been

807
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,100
doing it since he was 11

808
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,130
okay a question so how many like
percentage

809
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:17,220
a these people I actually know tending
to or the

810
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:22,210
aside in the beginning at the
professional I maybe twenty percent tops

811
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:22,740
actually

812
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,940
done it's really across segments of the
population

813
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,920
that some other more professional
engineers but there it anything the

814
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,750
number one

815
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,860
coming dominators artists we see more
artists who build robots than anything

816
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,350
else

817
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:38,410
on understand your people artists are
you people

818
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:41,950
and then they come out the other end
also being engineers and so than other

819
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,980
20 percent as engineers and their many
pretty

820
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,540
sixty percent is whatever and Dennis

821
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:52,060
literally my internal medicine doctor
jimmy you'd better

822
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:55,810
next question yeah them since

823
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:59,250
lot of things seem to be going this way
as well is there any

824
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,970
competitions or any thoughts a during
competition towards me

825
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:07,110
Michael Thomas there is a time estimate
only allowed to compete with autonomous

826
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:07,690
robots

827
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:11,260
we have specific autonomous weight
classes which mere the regular make

828
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:11,880
passes

829
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,490
for on one in thirty were so many on the
survivors

830
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:19,600
on a server up the rules allow for
autonomous robots

831
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,830
every week plus on the problem is is
that it is a very

832
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:27,500
in perfect environment so for instance
pursue more about that we do rebel games

833
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,940
on is all a Thomas but it's a perfect
environment which is to say

834
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,250
its a fife went black field with

835
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,900
a one inch white ring around it and a
robust programs only really

836
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,380
accept the fact that there is one other
robot in the field of play and the field

837
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,940
the plane there's nothing else in
existence

838
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,960
in the case something like large-scale
combat

839
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,150
a the amount the number variables

840
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:53,580
in terms love the walls the floor the
bumpers weird shit that is broke off

841
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,580
from the other robot

842
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,220
a its I've never seen anybody be able to
successfully

843
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,480
work but I'm develop code the cummerbund
on a

844
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,420
there have been some anti-missile
weapons where'd there be a sonar sensor

845
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:08,200
what heavy on the front and then that
would actually the weapon

846
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,260
but those are terrifying within our
within River games on the non-combat

847
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:12,900
side

848
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,180
I'll probably sixty or seventy percent
of the events are times

849
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:20,750
not mom from atop

850
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:24,360
is there any particular yes

851
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,130
humorous robot entries that you just
can't believe that somebody

852
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:33,250
I'll tell you good idea so we have my
bro but my part but categories all which

853
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,140
tend to be humorous

854
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,629
the best combat robot with somebody
actually who built them

855
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:41,660
the the counts that you saw their
possible Snoopy's doghouse

856
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:45,339
and Snoopy was on top of it and it had
anywhere learning out

857
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,450
on the bottom it lost the match but it
won the audience

858
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:52,600
one I'm and do you guys remember way
back in the day there is a Super Bowl

859
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,240
commercial that had a

860
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,040
had like big snarling there's like a Bud
Light Commercial been snarling

861
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,460
machine a death against Tina many prints
and i won

862
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,570
and a mini fridge opened up and it
smells like a giant years in bed liners

863
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:06,550
a giant hammerschmidt

864
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,660
somebody actually building bridges grape
question

865
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,279
done what's the most ridiculous weapon
you seen someone come

866
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,510
I'm with on there about what is the most
ridiculous weapon

867
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,510
ridiculous in terms potential or terms

868
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:22,660
argued was because in terms of
implementation rather than

869
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,200
potential so the robotic research before

870
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,890
for the shuffle on and you can see three
bars came down from it with

871
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:34,160
only two times in history as per rekey
min in their first-ever competition

872
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,560
one first place so next year everybody
copies concept in our

873
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,340
and so basically become a cargo cult
robots and get another apartment homes

874
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,150
from him

875
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:47,080
people upset broken its owner had and
100 on planes

876
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,310
some I am and so I saw one guy

877
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:53,660
build build the mars bar like that with
37 ish

878
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:57,020
harkin managing partner to use structure

879
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,250
and I Hassli ever sponsor loans

880
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:04,100
it's very dangerously understand that
but you do realize your break great

881
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,240
design only mine

882
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,520
spins up first time in up

883
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,770
he doesn't even hit the other guy and
just the forces

884
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:15,340
a.m. bars in Iran sure the carbonated

885
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,350
lives of the body like a helicopter
comes up comes back down

886
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:21,460
smashing learned a new neural damage to
your email

887
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:26,470
was like dude burkhardt nice wench him

888
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:30,110
any other questions alright

889
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:37,110
thanks very much well

890
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:58,080
with

891
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,360
