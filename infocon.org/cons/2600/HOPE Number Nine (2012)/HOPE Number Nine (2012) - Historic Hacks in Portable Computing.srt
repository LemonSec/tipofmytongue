1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,260
fourth track on health and seen across
weights unscheduled

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,419
if you wanna go ahead and schedule I'll
talk you're gonna give yourself

3
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:11,670
on you can visit the Info Desk sign up
and there's also a wiki online

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,150
I that's a little bit different than
what I had said yesterday which is

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,900
actually ron is not a paper by the door
to sign up there

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,760
idea things after the keynote after yes
men speak today there will be lightning

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,260
talks and has no time to do a short
little talk

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,769
on all kinds of random things larry
happen here I'm calm so

9
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:31,210
I think we a few israeli go testing

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,480
testing second Mike admission they're
probably gonna buy maybe even gonna

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,390
well over alt Julie on top of things are
so I

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,719
right now we're going to have eighty
vintage computer talking like this

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,600
because introduce themselves that's
alright just Inc

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,460
my name's probate just wanna thank
whoever has a keeps trying again to my

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,020
droid

16
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,860
every five minutes appreciate that
waterfront I'm

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,690
to 90 min the right place I'm and I am A

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,940
the vice president the Milan Court for
computing hobbyists with my

19
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,890
I'm friend over your event who's the
president and

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,590
which introduce yourself further I'm
event and I have turned off the wifi my

21
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,189
laptop

22
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:13,720
I don't even know that on somebody
sailor

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,908
acting yeah arm good for so those %uh
viewer hope veterans I'm sure you've

24
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,960
seen us here last couple times around

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,619
mom so we run issues a group called
March

26
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:27,640
which is middle word it was our middle I
think we're dropping hobbyist before in

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,659
2004

28
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:31,950
and we have dozens a member's around
these

29
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,909
many states around and we have a
bricks-and-mortar computer museum in

30
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:36,840
central New Jersey

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,670
I'll so there's at arm

32
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:45,640
bills expertise is history packing my
shorties history a portable computers

33
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:52,470
so we said let's put them together
that's we're doing okay

34
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,840
arm a lot of people when it you know you
so what's a portable computer

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,670
the first thought is up you can fit in
your pocket were lease carry around in a

36
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,110
backpack or whatever else

37
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,860
arm but all portable means is designed
to be moved around

38
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,560
regardless of size arm so you can have a
computer that's very small

39
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,090
like say I don't know Commodore 128

40
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,120
I but is not a portable computer it
could be moved around with the Stars

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,170
primary attention

42
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,560
on the other extreme you can have a
computer is because a tractor-trailer

43
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,819
but if it's made for that purpose for
such as being put to try to nap I

44
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,120
thought that it is a portable

45
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,879
so my point is portable is not
synonymous with small size necessarily

46
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,879
when what is a hack arm

47
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,209
so you on the way to hack isn't rational
sense but as far as we're concerned

48
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:46,110
i hack also means sopping interesting
that was done to make the part in the

49
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,890
first place

50
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,360
as opposed to stop in at the park was me
to do that wasn't meant to do

51
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,489
are many many of these early examples of
large portable computers

52
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:58,670
there were fascinating hacks involve to
create them

53
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,650
so the first half for two-thirds are
talk will focus all

54
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,159
quite a bit on that and then so some in
a more modern devices will get into

55
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,599
interesting hack so they were use

56
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,810
for in a little bit about how to hack
with yes this is more of a historical

57
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,180
talking typical one

58
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,060
but there's room for everybody I can see
the slide

59
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,150
this is the this is the cool guy with
his

60
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,150
portable Sourav exit the source your
computer

61
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,540
and a you tease he's moving in on the on
the woman on campus who happens to be

62
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,879
holding a tape recorder

63
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,370
at Sep in back in the seventies I'm
answer college for women would do is a

64
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,900
walk around the tape recorders

65
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,150
and then catch him to monitor the new
they were

66
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,629
you know available so that was was a
whose so that that's that's the computer

67
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:47,709
Lee mating ritual there but we just want
to show the portable computing

68
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:50,459
it's like saying I know how to use a
computer so these guys been walking

69
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:51,739
around with the guys we mean

70
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:55,170
we're very serious about the topic for
talk but there'll be plenty of humor as

71
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:55,580
well

72
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,980
like that for example aka so this is
dicey ac

73
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,120
this is one a dicey ax to do forty-foot

74
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,849
tractor-trailers I dicey act was

75
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:12,379
a vacuum tube computer it was pretty
much the last

76
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,600
other back into generation from 53 or 54
so

77
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,509
and arm lots of interesting hacks
involved a sack first let me tell you

78
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,790
what was then why was made arm

79
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,210
what howard got to be portable sort of a
mystery no one knows I've

80
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,198
I've personally interviewed many of the
engineers worked on and no one can quite

81
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:33,930
figure how

82
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,770
whose idea was to make a portable arm

83
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,889
boarded you know is you know you go back
to any act for example

84
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:45,900
in rower to obviously not portable
computer

85
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,210
door remove 15,000 square feet

86
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,090
boy when it was moved from University
Pennsylvania to Aberdeen Proving Ground

87
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,900
they did put on a truck are when Conrad
Zeus was just keeping bombardment in

88
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,699
Germany

89
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:03,080
he put his computer on a truck arm under
a couple other examples of computers

90
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,758
outward portable by

91
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:10,990
people start to think you know it would
help it you can move things around

92
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,160
arm one of the interesting things about
I see act was

93
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,919
it was the first computer ever with
printed circuit boards

94
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,650
are many you something called an auto
assembly technique which was

95
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,850
primitive way of manufacturing circuit
boards the time

96
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:33,850
mom Nayak

97
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,409
year

98
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:41,770
so I have the all about a 1000 word
paper which I'm not gonna treat you

99
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,020
on all the techniques are used to make a
rugged

100
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,938
to survive the truck arm and one of
these days I'll publish out not long

101
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,020
will spare you the PowerPoint karaoke

102
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,849
good

103
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:58,759
arm as interesting as this act was it
never really worked

104
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,300
are what the deal was that it was
designed by the National Bureau of

105
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,419
Standards which is now nest in DC

106
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:08,030
and it was driven I to the

107
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,039
White Sands Singapore the white sands
missile base in New Mexico

108
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,599
and they had a sample a test happen
sample app for it and the test app was

109
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:16,509
for measuring

110
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,639
speeds up winds aloft the problem was

111
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,379
the purser keyboards a primitive they
did in cow on the white sand getting

112
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:24,389
inside the computer

113
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:28,139
are mean that was pretty much the end of
that her

114
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,849
so they put it away and that was handed
a computer

115
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:36,909
arm but it was a beautiful concept now
next light bill

116
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:40,090
there was only one of these over me the
case this

117
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,650
is one up to 30 for trailers from Moby
Dick

118
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,389
any of you who attended our talk two
years ago about the history of computing

119
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:47,949
in the

120
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,159
Europe area may remember this part arm

121
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:54,440
Moby Dick had several damages over dicey
act one it was

122
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,229
small 25 percent smaller per truck arm

123
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:03,370
Moby Dick was the fourth or fifth
computer in the role to use transistors

124
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,639
and you something called the old data

125
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,190
field data was love as far as I know the
first method to make

126
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,229
different make some are also computers
talk to each other common format most

127
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:17,699
you never heard of your data

128
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,479
but evolve into something called ASCII
if you ever wonder why ASCII I mean

129
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,520
any work Tom you ask it stands for you
got what it stands for a anybody

130
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,539
in our Code for Information Interchange

131
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:32,789
why does that stand for that well the
reason why is

132
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:35,830
it was a joint for field data was a
joint project that the military

133
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,940
industrial complex

134
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,150
so it really was an American code for a
free agent Ritch

135
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,680
%uh there's a reason it came up with
that horrible acronym pic

136
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,759
arm there's a great story

137
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,529
i hack your social hack about why it
became a portable computer

138
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:55,209
so there was in the secret army
Singapore laboratory and the Jersey

139
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,279
Shore which by the way now is the home
to our museum will talk about later

140
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:01,509
are it was called Camp Evans no
relationship to me

141
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:04,740
commitment arm and these guys in the

142
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,610
early to mid 50's had a back into
computer a Burroughs lighter data 2005

143
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,440
and but 55 to 60 with our be obsolete
they wanted a modern transistor computer

144
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,610
and they want to the Army for fines and
the army said no

145
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,360
warning if you money for fuel technology
solder social hack was okay we'll put in

146
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,149
a trouble call

147
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:25,360
fuel technology when I get your that the
wheels off to have our own computer

148
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,509
Act number one arm

149
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,870
the opposite extreme there were about a
half dozen

150
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,649
fielded a compatible computers made by
soco's Sylvania RCA

151
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:42,750
et cetera IBM on the opposite extreme
%uh

152
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,959
Moby Dick was a computer call my compaq
which stood for

153
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,560
through micro module be the processor I
think

154
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,100
are micro modulo pocket indoor in years

155
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,540
another at number two in the late
fifties

156
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,670
50 Durso the integrated circuit was
invented you know

157
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,199
Cup competitively by TI and and

158
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:08,849
fair trial after child TI

159
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,899
and we did a microchip fairchild yeah
arm

160
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,319
well the raw think I can be later me was
for anyway it took 10 years for

161
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:17,599
integrated circuits to be

162
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,810
feasible even by the military standards
so

163
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,160
the Air Force in the Navy in the army

164
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,920
all had competing projects to make like
a legal like

165
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,099
modular assemblies have components and
the army's project is the one that won

166
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,540
the navy's a call product tinker toy it
didn't work

167
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,180
the are the air force's I feel was
called something westinghouse a bill

168
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,610
kristol organic circuits

169
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,480
way ahead of its time the army so called
micro model so they would have these

170
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,269
little things as i za sugar cubes

171
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:49,310
and they would have occurred I O diode
register one transistor

172
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,079
there's a capacitor once had a rough and
a couple of them in and make circuits

173
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:54,430
that were faster and better he

174
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,400
he you know he variables and whatnot so
that was a hack as well

175
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,250
so micro pack was only a hundred pounds
in nineteen sixty

176
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:09,100
6 the two or three years ago he was
listed as a man carry a full computer

177
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,380
arm the other Mike heard the other micro
model application everyone has heard of

178
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,949
was the handy talky

179
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:19,740
the walkie talkie arm also so the
engineers refer to this one as the brady

180
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,110
back

181
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,370
arm stop I can't make this stuff up

182
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,800
so on yeah okay into one more thing I
forgot to mention

183
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,900
about arm about

184
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,680
dicey effort still step backward arm so
they had to use four-letter

185
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,329
codes for each preacher different
commands and then

186
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:44,990
are women human computers were
introduced as

187
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,850
you know a sec secretaries a programmers
to the team and he realized summer to

188
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,900
fall under current codes might not be

189
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,569
appropriate arm so they had a program
had to come up with to go through it

190
00:10:55,569 --> 00:11:00,059
and find those words and change them and
has happened for three orchard the

191
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,600
hammer to it when an order

192
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,360
on that little program became the basis
for one of the preeminent papers on

193
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,839
error checking

194
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,050
and the CM

195
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,790
okay that's what's next bill the donner
this is Bill

196
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,120
this is this is one of my favorite
computers such as a Donner

197
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,470
from its it's considered to be the for
least kevin tells me this anyway this is

198
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,589
the first

199
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:27,199
production portable computer over me

200
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:31,319
I would say the first production I man
carry a full

201
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:35,149
man kissing a single man carrying your
and this particular 1i think

202
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:38,449
is the oldest one Castillo's serial
number one

203
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:42,649
that is exist in is also goes by what
your definition a computer where we're

204
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:45,199
not counting the applicants were not
counting the

205
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:48,809
IBM Simon you know toy logic trainer are

206
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:52,640
electronic well not not digital by
electronic computers and

207
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,329
but what's good about this thing inside
for a while that isn't all that from

208
00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:00,290
1959 but you could see this is gonna
plug word on top events in analog

209
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,770
computer for those either

210
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,430
are knowledgeable about that stuff and
the screen on the front the voltmeter

211
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,899
is the display I'm however from

212
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:13,529
when I what I would do is i would look a
arm an oscilloscope up to this

213
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:17,930
and I can use it and I'm work when I
want to say is that you could

214
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,180
years years ago here's another view the
inside this is the ripped the Blue

215
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,520
Ribbon bus

216
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,130
a connect ok expose connector pull that
one off the

217
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,529
amplifiers and you can see the the the
bigger

218
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:32,610
I amplifier on AIM right have your photo
there

219
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,649
arm and there's some wiring I'm they do
with another

220
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:40,120
from now my computer but the idea with
one of these things is you could hook

221
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,760
one of these up to

222
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,290
a phone system and you could read the
signal love the data coming in to get

223
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,040
the quality the data coming in

224
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,630
returning to you if you could do that
you could also

225
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,329
you know I intercept the phone signals
as you could

226
00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:00,569
more or less just create your own a
little phone exchange for this coming in

227
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:01,540
on computer

228
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,040
so the very earliest on phone hacking
would be done with analog

229
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,679
type equipment not digital equipment has
been uneven in italy:

230
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,839
50's early 60's someone like that would
have been using something looks a little

231
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,230
bit like this

232
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,870
I'm potentially to at first in their job
maybe

233
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,870
actually do real work and then maybe
after work come

234
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,179
you know I know there are they need to
make a phone call on so that is go to

235
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,540
the local junction box take their

236
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:32,599
other portable donner 3500 and I battery
and Unisource Copan

237
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,459
and you know maybe make a quick phone
call exist got to tell someone they're

238
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:36,390
coming

239
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:41,040
just a theory okay

240
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,219
okay arm

241
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,730
so eniac I was the opposite this

242
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,809
are the man the pitchers Jon Lockley who
was the

243
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:55,309
physicist professor at the University
Pennsylvania

244
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:58,390
and he was the mean

245
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,470
a inventor Anthony after

246
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,899
by the late fifties or so a course like
chart data processing what's the buzz

247
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:06,670
word of the day

248
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,189
and it was very widespread and computers
were no longer a new thing all thanked

249
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:15,059
and Jon Lockley and his partner are
capers record each had a series of

250
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:15,829
startups

251
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:19,740
mostly failed after the left univac they
were has been strictly their their their

252
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,750
time at the SM

253
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,069
but I'm not be have one more trick up
his sleeve

254
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:30,939
arm in 1594 the copy Komaki Associates a
consulting company

255
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:34,429
and what the deal was aided

256
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:39,329
project management software are for
construction companies engineering firms

257
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:41,240
that sort of thing

258
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,419
and they were very close friends with
the people dupont to

259
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:48,689
copiers buyer had invented hurt any and
things like that all the project

260
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:51,740
management techniques

261
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,850
so their software

262
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,959
was designed to be run on these massive
mainframes you know sizeof

263
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,520
room and obviously they couldn't take
down airplanes to potential customers

264
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,260
and demonstrated

265
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,589
good in a lot of customers were
pondering buying such a computer based

266
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:10,130
on the audio software

267
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,429
so what how with a democrat or software
about the computer

268
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:16,730
want to catch 22 so

269
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,140
mock we set out to build a portable
computer in a briefcase

270
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,439
also analog

271
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:27,400
you arm but see

272
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,860
so but here's the catch: it was paper
where

273
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,780
arm what happened was there's a
wonderful book just called any act by

274
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,679
got him Scott McCartney

275
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,630
Scott mccartney's Wall Street Journal
reporter and I reckon I really in my

276
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,199
opinion is the best eniac book

277
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:46,360
written and I read it if years ago in
the last chapters and applause for all

278
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,949
you know where they now what happened to
these guys

279
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:54,120
and reporter wrote that here one
sentence or two sentences at Markley

280
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,069
you know fifteen to twenty years before
I was born in a suitcase portable

281
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:58,100
computer

282
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,520
anti-civil whatever happened to it and
saw email reporter is that I don't know

283
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,640
if you can find out more

284
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,530
you know good luck to you so I made it
my mission to find all about this

285
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,709
computer

286
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:11,289
arm there was a parent

287
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:17,280
there was the many many documents about
cost to build it and

288
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,360
blueprint and everything else good there
was a press release

289
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,819
there were articles in the mainstream
media there were dozens of letters from

290
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:26,539
potential customers

291
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:31,770
they were cost evaluations there was as
wonderful Press Photo at a trade show

292
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,490
there was everything you could possibly
have for a computer except

293
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,709
the computer arm I've talked to a few
former employees walkers oh shit and

294
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,640
working mister mark is deceased

295
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,250
they all said he was never made it was a
good idea one or two prototypes for me

296
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,770
they barely worked

297
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,839
on in the mock the archives at the
University Pennsylvania

298
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,209
I found an original marking document

299
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:59,740
other computer was called schedule flow
sked UFL 0

300
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,020
and someone across to flow in rhode slow

301
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,299
schedule slow and the idea was it will
be different versions you could have

302
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:11,689
you know 5 10 20 things at a time and
what we do is you know you would

303
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:14,949
plug in your blood board and so you
would turn

304
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,209
the electricity is certainly not a one
side and it would affect the amount on

305
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:19,199
the other side

306
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,350
and so this could be correlated the
analog I love how would you change

307
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,208
something your scheduler cost your
project brand apart whatever else it

308
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:28,880
would affect arrested a project

309
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,690
so that's what it was supposed to be

310
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,980
arm so even though it was never made I

311
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,340
and even know it was you know you're too
after diner

312
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,668
arm you know it took

313
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:47,010
daughter with the company that produced
it but atop the man who invented

314
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:53,190
eniac to come up with the idea for

315
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,539
next big

316
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:00,240
this is the the Texas Instruments silent
700

317
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,520
terminal so you never seen or use one of
these before

318
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,679
a this is the this is actually the 707

319
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:10,590
with the acoustic coupler attachment and

320
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:15,490
this was actually would have been a
later version originally came in 1971

321
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,870
and the reason they were showing the
slightest just demonstrated before the

322
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,429
microcomputer

323
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:24,409
where portables and such were available
there was a period of time

324
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:27,490
I'm in the early seventies or if you
wanted to from

325
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,260
I'm have access to computing I'm from
home

326
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,429
for whatever reason you would use some
sort of a terminal

327
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:38,460
type device on as an alternative to the
arm

328
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,799
on to a teletype or phone system rare so
this was

329
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:45,039
is a revolutionary because this gave you
the ability to actually

330
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,260
hold something in carry it so it's one
of the first portable

331
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:53,419
terminals it use paper instead have a
class terminal it was the first portable

332
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:56,620
type to lose one or two others but this
is my favorite

333
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,100
and it's one that have something the CFO
to love

334
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:06,859
that I was used for that purpose

335
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:09,428
okay arm if you could

336
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:12,569
so these are all suitcase computers from
the are

337
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:16,339
mid-seventies and up before I go the
slightest

338
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:19,668
one more spot I've got to put in but all
tell you a little story this is the only

339
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:21,359
time I'll redo my props

340
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,289
arm so a mafia mission a minute ago

341
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,859
got a Time magazine reporter interested
in his suitcase computer

342
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:33,879
which was a poor and the time magazine
reporter kept problem of the about you

343
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:35,689
know what the future portable computers

344
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:38,779
so mob leaders made up something on the
spot

345
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:43,819
and reporter took it seriously are in
its hysterical so i'll read you and try

346
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:45,579
to read slow I don't talk too fast

347
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:49,158
it was called time magazine headline
said pocket shopper

348
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:54,709
in this is in the sixty-something and it
says definitely not yet on the market

349
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:59,379
but in addition by doctor Jon Lockley is
a miniature computer for household use

350
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:03,319
that will not only make shopping list
obsolete paul also marked the extension

351
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,339
at the grocery clerk in the checkout
counter man

352
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:08,908
all gets better before going to market

353
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:13,189
a woman will supercomputer into her
purse it will happen in New toria what

354
00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:17,049
you need in the wave stable supply store
in the wafer-thin memory cells

355
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,549
once on the market well john wants

356
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:23,689
at the market she will plug your
computer into a socket in a vacant

357
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,739
delivery alcove wait for the results

358
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:29,259
the computer will carry out the business
of identifying itself

359
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:33,439
making the proper accounting entries in
its own memory and authorizing a charge

360
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:35,939
against its mistresses universal
checking account

361
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:39,789
in less than a minute water slides an
issue

362
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:44,949
and the house wife brings home
electronic Megan Dhaka motley

363
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:47,709
who invented somebody original be
computers and already built one the size

364
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:49,919
is a case is working on the pocket

365
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,289
the pocket monster not be was working on
no such thing in 1964

366
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:59,819
should arm but you once you know it
certainly was on

367
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:03,009
you know and pretty accurate it won't
happen twenty thirty years later

368
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:06,269
except for the horrible sexism bar

369
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:09,559
big here okay

370
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:13,658
so D computer here on the top left

371
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:17,419
slava slide with the two giant like a
sad looking things in the middle

372
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:20,969
that from a company in Toronto call
microcomputer machines

373
00:21:20,969 --> 00:21:24,859
and you would treat Rondo people here no
arm

374
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:28,688
to compete with call the MCM seventy
what's up but I miss

375
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:33,749
I miss something could be worse for MCM
78 1973

376
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:37,309
in in this is really really interesting
because

377
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:40,489
1973 to have an all lawn

378
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:44,279
ready to go non kid microcomputer

379
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:47,959
I'm not going to say it was the Bathurst
microcomputer

380
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:51,469
by it's got a damn good case 1973 I mean

381
00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:54,719
not much I don't know what beats at what
was a processor

382
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:57,819
I don't know I get back

383
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:01,069
okay are Iran Iran a programming
language called ppl

384
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,839
you guys know it pls a programming
language yes

385
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:08,969
that stands true look it up arm so was a
bill computer

386
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:12,259
and arm there's only a few these in
existence

387
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:16,679
the there's the University Archives are
York University in Toronto

388
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:19,719
other guy is like for him there he
literally wrote the book on this

389
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:20,269
computer

390
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:24,299
his last name is stacked the Act St atch

391
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,569
and I a cave in russell type and I'm

392
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:34,569
IBM made arise did with the computer s
not a landslide in 1975 call the IBM

393
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:35,829
5100

394
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:39,109
it was called the portable computer
there was no handle there was no case

395
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,198
there were no wheels

396
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:45,169
it would did you pounds is a tinge to
strive with about 70 pounds and was

397
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:46,629
doubly nah portable computer

398
00:22:46,629 --> 00:22:50,099
but 1975 in IBM's you with that was a
portable computer

399
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:54,029
set an example that I was talking
earlier about so heiss party or portable

400
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:57,209
but the MCM did have a handle

401
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,959
arm the top right is the Xerox

402
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:06,799
Park note taker park was the Palo Alto
Research Center

403
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,829
arm xerox has computer well

404
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:13,559
a couple years before this really
seventies LMK oath

405
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,079
dogs bark came up with something called
the Dynabook a lot of people think it on

406
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,379
a bob was the thing

407
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:23,149
he wasn't there was a concept just an
idea there never was a Dynabook

408
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:26,739
are basically he in ninety predicted

409
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:30,139
dreamed up the iPad in 1970 so arm

410
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:34,319
but the note taker are was the

411
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,209
quick referred to internally as he
injure me to write a book are because

412
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:38,999
every and thus

413
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:43,759
their focus was a software not a
hardware but with a disordered in

414
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,909
Bunnell EU was invented be no stopping

415
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:50,809
like an oz born six or seven years
before not support and I Alan Kay

416
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:56,039
personally tell me that is on airplay
use on battery power for a while

417
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:00,009
arm the way you don't know 30-40 pounds

418
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:03,109
bottle mmm left is the

419
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:06,928
computers I'll that is the mic row the

420
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:10,769
arm from a company called are chewy it
stand for something French again

421
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:12,259
pronounce

422
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:15,629
and arm so different company called
micro

423
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:18,699
Andy does not I thought it meant then
because they were other

424
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:23,459
Mike Mike miles before this I was a form
that V which was the first letter of the

425
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:24,209
word

426
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:28,099
iron out now so was I love the laser
something which means briefcase

427
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:32,049
in France try but for the precision that
with the Met

428
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:35,279
so it's very hard to see in the picture
because it allows the pitcher

429
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,469
but if you squint you can see on the
right side there's a five and a quarter

430
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:40,799
floppy disk drives or to pops up

431
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,269
and the monitor on the canards more we
looked good he worked for governor front

432
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:48,179
is actually opens up like a suitcase in
the minors in the middle

433
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:52,099
so that was that that was a seven the or
so

434
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:56,428
and then finally on the bottom right is
a company called GM research

435
00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:00,049
nothing to general motors arm yes these
guys

436
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:03,469
late seventies I asked him where the
company in a company from and they say

437
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:05,779
war there was already a company called
ok I'll

438
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:10,699
dot delco electronics certificate with a
camera model GM the into

439
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:15,339
arm with you their initials there was a
guy with GM god dammit you to the mark

440
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:17,708
in ecology and people will associate

441
00:25:17,709 --> 00:25:21,489
are but this also are what happened here
was this guy I forget what initially

442
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:22,559
worked in

443
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,449
arm by Tom he was he put a command go

444
00:25:26,449 --> 00:25:29,469
which is a big old as well under
computer any got harder schlepping

445
00:25:29,469 --> 00:25:30,339
around

446
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:33,789
so we had the idea let's put it you know
suki sizing

447
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:36,949
arm so that's what that was and

448
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:40,839
these are not all others who keep
computers in the seventies user somebody

449
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:45,698
examples arm by edye when oswald came
around

450
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:48,979
a lot of people credit are swarming with
inventing

451
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:52,249
the Supes computer they did obviously no
such thing

452
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:55,709
they had the first mass success

453
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:59,769
Suki's computer but through the night
indented cities or prior art example so

454
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:03,319
interesting hacks attach them

455
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:08,499
okay arm portable companion was the
Osborn magazine this was the first issue

456
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:12,509
our reporter from Chicago went to
Afghanistan

457
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:17,829
and brought his Osborne with them and as
well as a result

458
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:22,158
arm I E I know the thousands I we
thought since I was the engineer who

459
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,909
actually designed the Osborne for Adam
Osborne

460
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:28,649
and he autographed one of these for me a
couple years ago and

461
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:31,949
on the inscription hero I hope you never
catch a guy wrote the manual

462
00:26:31,949 --> 00:26:37,499
which was him s he actually came and
visited with us at two weekends ago at

463
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:38,299
our club in a

464
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:42,399
we're working was working on a soul 20
and

465
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:45,509
in there if you know what that is but
that's the computer he voted for this

466
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:46,019
one

467
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:49,269
some actually working on his computer
news helping me this it's like it never

468
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:52,429
happened very poor job helping not be
restored a milder

469
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:56,959
jury 100 show you how to play the guitar
you know get the be enough which

470
00:26:56,959 --> 00:27:01,239
speaking of guitar playing your next
slide

471
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:04,809
not that I was born yes XLI

472
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:08,319
with a Segway okay her not that hard

473
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,438
this is this is a this is the Osborne is
a better photo

474
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:15,909
on into on like the forcibly computers
are shuttered

475
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:21,319
this was expressly designed for this
purpose arm he weighed 23 pounds or so

476
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:25,479
arm a couple interesting things about
the Osborne

477
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:29,689
arm except for those rocks note taker
which is only a prototype

478
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:33,699
the other three computers i sat on a
previous slide artwork commercial ones

479
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:37,299
but the report abuse by the PLO them the
wall there were no batteries

480
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:41,379
arm this is a story that has never been
told I know because we told to me

481
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:42,109
personally

482
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:45,899
he said he never told anybody else and
so on now to you

483
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:49,929
arm their use a battery port other for
the Osborne

484
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:53,509
which has battery on it was for a future
upgrade that never existed

485
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:56,889
there were two options for batteries
that were never made there was a company

486
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:58,489
Osborne contracted with

487
00:27:58,489 --> 00:28:01,569
that we're going to take a tool for car
battery and somehow

488
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:05,639
attached to this thing that didn't come
to fruition armed with a better story is

489
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:06,269
bill

490
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:09,329
you've taken apart if you are supporting
your time right yes I have did you ever

491
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:12,079
wonder why the keyboard is hollow inside

492
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,259
have wanted empty room in it to put the
battery in there

493
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:19,989
yes they want a bill that will see cells

494
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:23,209
harm that didn't come unfortunately
osborn

495
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:27,039
Inc without a business before he came to
fruition but they had a plan to fill to

496
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:27,709
keep word

497
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:32,859
with all the space would be called C
cells and that didn't happen you

498
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:36,168
very why do I have this come I just

499
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:39,269
I E when I was younger I'm

500
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:43,789
I went to the store owners you want to
get a video game for myself and went to

501
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:44,249
the

502
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:48,279
the video rental place and grab this one

503
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:51,529
see what it would never be any good to
play took it home

504
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:55,629
and I like that enough on that and get
to the end the game and had to return it

505
00:28:55,629 --> 00:28:56,450
so

506
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,599
this really is what got me interested in
hacking how do I keep this

507
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,218
and return it at the same time I so what
I

508
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:06,289
what I did was through a series of other
events

509
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:09,879
I figured out how to how to get through
there's three files on there that you

510
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:10,859
need to

511
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:14,668
I'm change so that there they're located
where they're supposed to be located

512
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,239
anywhere and it gives you the ability to

513
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:20,639
I'm not have to have the master desk and

514
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:23,769
this is the computer that I why use
words a portable

515
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:28,119
on that if you were if you're into back
in those times in those days

516
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:33,329
if you were using using a computer is
kinda the

517
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:38,190
a central arm the filtration system
review need something to just do your

518
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,809
utility work with

519
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:43,609
any needed to be portable to take
forever these I found to be very useful

520
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:44,689
to put another

521
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:48,679
three half inch disk drive into it and
I'm this will give you the ability to

522
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:50,759
transfer dis run system to another

523
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:54,789
and the IBM with this being relatively
solid to give you the ability to

524
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:58,849
right 10 DVDs clean right other format
this week's EP anderson's

525
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:02,668
this was this is my when my favorite
it's not it's not pretty

526
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:06,269
but it it definitely I'm had allowed the
utility

527
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:10,449
for things I'm now and go talk about the
cam

528
00:30:10,449 --> 00:30:13,489
and I'm no idea how this fits in okay

529
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:17,190
arm pursue a little note about the
computer bilder show there was an IBM

530
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,929
5155 yes for at the mansion and armed

531
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:25,019
you know osborn the case was 23 pounds
but was told plastic

532
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:28,329
IBM be an IBM there's have a metal
handle on it

533
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:31,459
another beautiful computer heavy your
IBM XT

534
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:35,729
he's basically poured why the Act next
season they're the first serious

535
00:30:35,729 --> 00:30:39,389
I'm you know though IBM had that poured
was for the first time was actually

536
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:42,679
your product if you hit someone with
your IBM to his computer they will be

537
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:44,489
hurt my feelings

538
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:50,409
good so the chem arm Kim was made in
1976 by Moss technology the

539
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:53,719
metres so the legendary city 502 chip

540
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:57,779
are after our speech or go downstairs
supper club with what happened working

541
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:00,769
on this by

542
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:03,919
a lot of people how the idea

543
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,059
all those computers really small anna
has very very low

544
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:12,059
battery requirements: so I could pretty
easily sticky

545
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:15,739
you know small case small briefcase

546
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:18,949
or up by underworld block or

547
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:22,029
or whatever else and put some batteries
and I've got a full fledge portable

548
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:23,299
computer

549
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,759
a lot of people did that the reason some
companies whose names

550
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:30,409
limny right now maybe the recalls and
actually so computers in binders in

551
00:31:30,409 --> 00:31:31,879
cases like that the whole of this

552
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:35,309
this Friday shouldn't in genetics I
don't know

553
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:39,759
in six innings to keep so anyway and I
bonior's

554
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,809
not mean these computers we'll talk
about leader pin our booth

555
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:47,879
arm but singapore computers were in
alternative

556
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:51,399
tassel 100 computers are the
mid-seventies and they were very easily

557
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:55,409
made portable because he had such low
power requirements and resource mostar

558
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:59,509
said I was a free compact do take your
SBC you make it portable

559
00:31:59,509 --> 00:32:03,539
you want whenever we come the hope to do
presentation we have portable

560
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,839
vintage stuff because we've taken train
because we're

561
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,859
from the servers would this

562
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:14,009
arm never getting the more modern stuff

563
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:17,779
yeah but you do did you get the slot I
sent you off the oh nevermind ask the

564
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:18,599
court to suffer now

565
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:21,689
okay you in a few spots on the

566
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,869
down the down their presentation here
really go back in June fill in the gap

567
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:26,139
here

568
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:30,169
this is called the a company called the
VW

569
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:33,940
which stood for were DVD viewing

570
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,199
the guys name whatever was are British
company

571
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:42,429
arm this is me this computer was
manufacture +91

572
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:45,819
it and within the

573
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:49,499
arbitrary definition powerful laptop
computer

574
00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:54,159
in my opinion this is the first laptop
computer

575
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,539
that is my opinion not you hard group
meeting

576
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:02,229
arm this is the first computer that is
the form factor of a laptop

577
00:33:02,229 --> 00:33:06,499
with the full QWERTY keyboard integrated
screen and runs on battery power by

578
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:08,789
default

579
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:13,619
it was are commissioned by the water
utilities and other utility companies in

580
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:14,659
Britain

581
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,709
and then sold marks a commercially

582
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:21,440
arm him it was originally designed with
an

583
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,679
with a keyboard that was be 3z but
people will customize it for their

584
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,879
utility needs

585
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:35,879
and %uh the first customer was a water
company called Severn Trent

586
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:39,289
and arm but see your

587
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:42,809
you the whenever the way to have a lot
of custom

588
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:45,849
things built users a keyboard batteries
software

589
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:49,189
because there was no president to build
anything like this before

590
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,889
the use Duracell batteries people too
often substituted for Nike ads

591
00:33:53,889 --> 00:34:00,889
so well the first laptop from a company
you never heard of

592
00:34:01,529 --> 00:34:04,889
this is the spatial nerves isn't

593
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:10,619
many case and now the reason that this
is a this is another example of where

594
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:13,949
manufactures had to come up with
something in order to

595
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:17,829
accomplish a goal and the goal here was
to get a computer

596
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:22,009
that had the capabilities %uh the early
eighties computer into space

597
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:25,659
I want one us one of the things we we've
worked with we don't have picture the

598
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:28,789
slides is the the computer models from
the apollo

599
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:32,139
arm missionaries huge you know

600
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:36,059
pizza boxes are stacked on top of each
other but by the time we got to the

601
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:37,440
spatial error

602
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,019
I'm company called grid I'm came up with
this

603
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:46,819
the grid compass in this this computer
is actually taken in the space shuttle

604
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:51,690
and it had to have certain on nasa
specifications for

605
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,839
was standing G-forces and so forth so
this is I'm not sure what

606
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,440
first this is a well whatever but from
attacking standpoint

607
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,019
I can I but they're not going to talk
about but this little term actor from a

608
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:03,980
case in point

609
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,259
this is this is motivated by try and
accomplish something that always

610
00:35:08,259 --> 00:35:12,469
really the the back the backdrop to any
good tracking project

611
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:15,799
is the fact is trying to accomplish
something in terms I'll

612
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:19,519
first which is a dangerous teams were in
history with interesting about the Greek

613
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,160
artists 1100

614
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,390
is that it's the last not a first arm

615
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,469
it is a lot top form factor the original
plan for the grid called for a

616
00:35:28,469 --> 00:35:32,289
flack designed by the wanted to show you
the changes to a clamshell

617
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:35,829
on but this do not have boundaries
either later versions did

618
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:39,180
this had to be plugged in to 110 volts
are

619
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,319
so I would are you because a lot of
batteries bill

620
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:46,839
this is the last the sickies computers
rather than the first two laptops

621
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:50,180
it's the smallest lasted locals in the
mirror

622
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:54,819
bars or so day ago lot in terms of the
shape

623
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:59,288
he will be the first with that designer
the falling down screen

624
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:02,319
so didn't have any batteries for

625
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:06,730
nope granddaughter did nope arm well
they have a special

626
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:11,569
it was a portable speak spatial now
there was a a a Kansas commercially

627
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,808
available version which i'd have a
special attached to it

628
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:19,929
the commercially available version call
the 1101 which I hadn't sold the film

629
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:25,849
arm the 1100 was only four were defense
contractors so here I love 108 a real

630
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:27,940
gem because they weren't meant to be in
the wild

631
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:34,940
the only difference between 1100 1101 is
the amount of RAM

632
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:39,309
I speak your space shuttles I remember
to hopes ago somebody had a um

633
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:43,250
at: receive a $100 their tracking
satellites with as a person here

634
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,349
by any chance II was kinda just

635
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:50,179
just watching more than anything but
this is another a very popular

636
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:54,069
portable computer that that's used for
I'm connecting the things

637
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:58,109
got you very often as a modem built into
it it's an early laptop it's not the

638
00:36:58,109 --> 00:37:00,000
first laptop or anything like that but

639
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,230
but it's certainly very popular one and
I it's got a a good legacy for

640
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:08,569
for you messin around and coming up with
stuff

641
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:12,779
good I he to criticize the media because
I mean it my day job as I'm a technology

642
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:13,640
journalist but

643
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,650
the media often point to this it says
first laptop what they mean you don't

644
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,190
know where does that mean first

645
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,460
huge smash hit commercial success laptop

646
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,960
I will now say keep aside keep a slight
I will now say evil word please don't

647
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,880
boo me

648
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,549
Microsoft in arm

649
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,670
well drilled into me ok him

650
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,839
this computer was commissioned by billy
gets

651
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:43,058
arm it gates

652
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:47,109
was you know somebody suggested the idea
before the laptop computer immediate in

653
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:47,558
like

654
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:51,079
but he detour so there were lotsa
computers are this

655
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:55,549
size and shape in cost there was the
Epson hx2 buddy in many others are the

656
00:37:55,549 --> 00:37:58,089
general size but Kate wanted his own

657
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:02,400
Microsoft then as now is not a hardware
company despite what they say about

658
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,059
service

659
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:07,130
arm you by the way at all because I'd

660
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:11,150
at the press announcement for surface if
there is a go bomber was going on and on

661
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,279
about Microsoft rich history in hardware

662
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:16,469
and all the example 2.2 was the mouse

663
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:19,650
arm he made a fool of himself

664
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:24,849
yet why the writ of actual your arm in a
was in the rocks iraq to the gooey

665
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:28,179
arstan for Research Institute at the map
starting a park

666
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:32,140
anybody anyway arm so gates approached

667
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:37,029
arm good his good friend who worked for
Kyocera

668
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:40,420
Japan and so what happened was Kia Ceres

669
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,630
designed the computer it and they sold
it and banners

670
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,670
various companies to Tino to tell the
public

671
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:50,929
you Q ser how division call coyote
reineck

672
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:55,770
so who in japan this computer was known
as E coyote ronit KCET 5

673
00:38:55,770 --> 00:39:01,089
in Europe it was the all the DM ten in
the NEC PC 2001

674
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:05,099
United States who was it any Radio Shack
curiousity my wondered

675
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:09,710
if anyone wonder what your ass was 10
the Radio Shack arm

676
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:13,929
so anyway Microsoft Commission computer

677
00:39:13,929 --> 00:39:17,509
no best known to us as a Radio Shack
computer

678
00:39:17,509 --> 00:39:20,770
and I also saw in addition to the
satellite thing admission that on

679
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,309
at the Fort Monmouth museum in New
Jersey which is no longer there

680
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:28,089
are I saw a picture of this in the field
when it was new

681
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:32,630
be used to talk to a satellite as well
for a reschedule obligation

682
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,119
you know what what what it was about the
satellite to this thing but apparently

683
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:41,089
I'm not in on it will also very very
popular among sports journalist two good

684
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:42,799
teams and brings with them

685
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:46,819
and hook up their acoustic modem itself

686
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:50,829
you intake of likes peco Pico flex

687
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:54,969
really come to some crypto examples are
for my script out

688
00:39:54,969 --> 00:39:58,699
this is really cool this was built by
Phillips

689
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:02,349
in 1976

690
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:06,130
someone please we're off in arm

691
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:12,059
this is basically a full-fledged laptop
computer

692
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:16,339
52 years before husky invented laptop
computer

693
00:40:16,339 --> 00:40:20,849
I just found out about this computer
last week after studying interpretable

694
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:21,779
should alas

695
00:40:21,779 --> 00:40:26,539
10 years in reading a book about it the
actual computer part in the middle comes

696
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:27,619
out to be a

697
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:31,130
stand-alone laptop computer it's amazing

698
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:35,609
a par on the left is a thermal printer
in the contraction on the right on top

699
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:37,480
is your acoustic modem

700
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,819
and there was a civilian version me it
turns out which I don't know about now

701
00:40:40,819 --> 00:40:42,259
feel for what about

702
00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:45,699
arm called the

703
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:49,409
I feel deserve something with an M that
doesn't help you

704
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:52,949
arm anyway I have to learn more about it

705
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:56,150
are not clear if they had it on
batteries are not clears could be

706
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,089
programmed

707
00:40:57,089 --> 00:41:01,770
I'm not clear if there were any app for
customization available

708
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,839
so in other words are not clear whether
it's an appliance

709
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,960
who were more of a general-purpose
computer I suspect

710
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,020
a couple things that input a slide in
arm

711
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,170
any your you wonder so

712
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:18,759
you as the laptop was dawning there were
a couple

713
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:21,900
devices that I consider to be almost
laptops

714
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,719
sort of like you know leader tom and
right

715
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:29,049
are chrome and the man Sony had
something called the type

716
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:32,969
quarter the tape recorder was a word
processor

717
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:38,170
it looks and feels it works exactly like
attend mr liderman up the checks twenty

718
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:43,640
except the only happy in it was were
processor and you couldn't change that

719
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,598
so had a micro cassette dry batteries
was a full-fledged

720
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,440
not a computer but it wasn't really a
lot talk was a was in a general-purpose

721
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,219
laptop it did one thing

722
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,969
looking back it's kinda funny because
Sony was

723
00:41:56,969 --> 00:42:01,199
one far away from having a laptop they
didn't know it

724
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,400
if only the ad would be sick and there
they would have beat everyone also had a

725
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,920
laptop

726
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,920
on this thing as well I think he was not
general purpose I think it was the app

727
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,119
is the app you got so Genna

728
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:17,699
so close to a laptop used in cross to
threshold

729
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:23,509
soldiers interesting interesting history
that almost happened

730
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:26,960
Mary they would recognize something like
this

731
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,569
no arm anyway this is this is this is a
a

732
00:42:30,569 --> 00:42:33,869
a typical rig used for I'm for

733
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:37,289
if you're at a hotel in you need to use
the phone which I wanna play

734
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:40,390
for I'm the this is the

735
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:43,509
like when you call the portal hacking
kit I'm that

736
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:46,690
you know you very but there's no word
from places on

737
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,219
it's a portable computer with a built-in
motive in the back and then you can't

738
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:51,400
quite see it on the left

739
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,500
there's a a a rj-11 the comes around the
side and then it's been spliced with

740
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,420
banana clips that would then go to

741
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,789
on the phone line that the hose phone
line

742
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:06,049
and then you have an alternative modem
acoustic motive in case it you couldn't

743
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:11,730
disconnect the the phone for the the
rj-11 for the back to the phones scissor

744
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:15,069
some fun tools that used to be very
popular

745
00:43:15,069 --> 00:43:18,199
I'm when trying to maxis telephone line
system

746
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:23,010
trip or black

747
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:26,530
this is this is another divided care
that's useful it's a I'm

748
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,680
and RJ arm I'm sorry a

749
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,368
RS 232 port scanner

750
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:36,720
but sport you know just will work for
what I call this thing

751
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,300
a breakup Oct but anyway I I use this a
lot just to see where the signals are

752
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,150
coming through

753
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:45,820
from one serial cable to another

754
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:50,520
from troubleshooting a problem okay

755
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:55,509
another interesting crypto example big

756
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:00,790
seventy six or so army enters the im not
going to remember

757
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:04,840
came to the US he and had a little
pocket

758
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,090
dictionary training a translator for
wonderfully which is built English

759
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:11,619
and you

760
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:15,350
had a friend who worked at Intel and he
was telling the president is pretty

761
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,170
intelligible anywhere computer was

762
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:20,340
and it was friend will be great if you
can take one of these little

763
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,440
pocket translators make that
computerized so was friend introduced

764
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,140
him to an entrepreneur

765
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,319
me came up with this thing in arm

766
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,330
could I

767
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:38,420
let's see the company was it was sold to
next door for wasn't me about next door

768
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:44,160
which is now Siemens idk basically what
he was a little helping about the size I

769
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,569
love

770
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:47,760
you know they can be just tape and

771
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,740
and had a cartridge slot and the company
sold

772
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:55,050
all these different cartridges a dozen
or so ashley moore twenty

773
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:58,270
always different language combinations
English Spanish Spanish to French

774
00:44:58,270 --> 00:44:59,880
Spanish to English et cetera

775
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,550
and so you would buy the device which
had a battery in a screen and a keyboard

776
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:07,920
and you would buy whatever cartridge you
wanted you

777
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,560
plug it in a translator but here's work
at school

778
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,029
they also had any

779
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:19,340
Kapil leader cartridge and they had a
flat file database cartridge

780
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,330
they had a notepad cartridge he was
essentially a

781
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:29,250
decentralized PA if you will arm have
all the app's to be a PDA but you had a

782
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,100
carranza per cartridge for each one

783
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:36,140
arm did want their best customers was

784
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:41,049
the National Security Agency and a sale
of these things

785
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:44,950
the cover them in the crypto devices
unfortunately they don't know any

786
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,100
details about but I am trying to find
out

787
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:51,210
this one

788
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:56,740
is equally interesting keeping there's a
hacker incompetence involved

789
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:00,570
and a hacker Apple involved this was

790
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:04,070
bar meet by one guide in Judah Klausner

791
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:08,040
who became in them is a few years ago
for being a patent role in suing Apple

792
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,940
for her first for visual

793
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,010
Visual Voicemail anyway arm

794
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:17,869
in juneau in his friend Bob Haro worries
in NYU graduate here in the city

795
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:23,580
in seven the seven or so and they're
looking for internships summer jobs

796
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,490
so do you know what was on pole who
owned the rolodex company

797
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:31,410
any said your YouTube what can I do to
summer technology

798
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:35,529
so the local so will you know work you
know go learn about microchips maybe you

799
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,150
can make a

800
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:41,390
you know makes up matter that so Juno
was inspired by walls around him

801
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:44,410
in made this thing this little gadget

802
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:47,859
good I'd also calculator it's not a
calculator

803
00:46:47,859 --> 00:46:54,529
it's a PDA com Apple coined the term PDA
in ninety-three

804
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:58,990
because her from seventy-eight fifteen
years before that I would point out as

805
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:00,030
an aside that

806
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,130
in the nineteen twenties or panel trucks

807
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:06,150
in the fifties or land cruisers in the
seventies or Broncos

808
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:10,010
in the nineties some arkin shimon went
to the SUV right

809
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:13,310
arm so Apple did not invent the PD

810
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:17,270
anyway fifty years before that there was
this little PTI and you look very

811
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:20,190
closely Getty on top of each key there
is a letter

812
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:23,390
as well I know you can see it on the
screen or not but has I'll

813
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:27,069
you know alphabetical Keyport and you
could see

814
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,750
on the atop your skis it's a rewriting
letter

815
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:34,119
so you can go into those moods in store
phone numbers in

816
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:37,170
appointments and names that they like
that

817
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,990
good anyway of first interesting point
here at the three

818
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:45,810
are so he made the sing over the summer
brought it back to was on call

819
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:49,430
in said you know who do this and
yokelson oh no we make real texas

820
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:50,190
Rangers did

821
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:54,320
the opposite realize this was rolled out
to the pitcher missed a huge opportunity

822
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,359
good so looking for a buyer for his
invention

823
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:01,960
judo want to the Trenton computer show
in nineteen

824
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,050
seventy eater so arm

825
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:08,910
and met happen to run into you Steve
Jobs who is bridging

826
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:13,980
Apple to and June a personally told me
that he tried to instill jobs about the

827
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,109
sinking admitted

828
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:18,600
and jobs merger petition wanted to talk
and not listen

829
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,810
arm in had jobs not been

830
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:26,589
like Ian's Apple could have possibly
have a nude in 15 years before they did

831
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:29,930
Apple could have said we had the first
PDA would have been truer

832
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:33,419
but they did arm the thirty pieces over
this in

833
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,820
the journal call cryptology up i have an
article I found where some

834
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:42,119
scientist actually found a way he told
the public or the public leadership at

835
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,240
the journal

836
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:48,089
you know wow this saying use agree
crypto device because got memory it's

837
00:48:48,089 --> 00:48:49,759
kinda long lasting battery

838
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,760
it's got alphanumeric capabilities this

839
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,240
could well be used for crypto purposes
so it's a fun little device

840
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,230
you could find on eBay for pretty cheap
too most people realize are rare in

841
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:03,980
important they are

842
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,020
okay this is the

843
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,600
Panasonic handheld computer 1400

844
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,180
me by message to also the quasar

845
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:18,069
this is one this is representative other
generation

846
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:21,970
are what was known as hand-held
computers these are you got out of the

847
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:23,760
pickpocket the store these

848
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,070
arm I forget what the hack was I want to
tell about

849
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:31,410
except that this is represented divided
other generation and these how

850
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:32,470
programmable

851
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,530
little romp archer's as well arm you got
me by APs

852
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:40,320
and plug them in like that I forget what
my example was so

853
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:46,480
light is just get this one okay this is
from 84 the Casio PFT thousand

854
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,920
here's the hack your handwriting
recognition

855
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,570
are non years before noon in you see the
park on the right

856
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:58,190
that grid you take your fingertip and
raw block a letter

857
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:02,250
any with design to recognize your block
letter alphabet

858
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,160
arm which precedes the idea palm having

859
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,450
graffiti having an idea I love you learn
the computers

860
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:17,170
in writing so far other way around to
increase percentage recognition

861
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:22,070
Cooper go back by the way arm

862
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:26,970
its it's hard to tell but on the bottom
left the second keeping the bottom

863
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:29,980
is labeled secrets arm

864
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:33,730
it had a password protection feature
which again was important to modern

865
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,270
smart phones and handhelds until

866
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:38,980
for the recently ok this is the

867
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:43,460
are the civilian version at the peak of
lax sup You Can Am I forget what it was

868
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,650
arm 85 yr so and it was you know

869
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:50,100
civilian isn't all sold the company's
largest defense contractors but it was

870
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,800
still in

871
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,190
a crypto device are another example I
did not been here

872
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:59,280
what year did move it w determine your
come out a terminar

873
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,630
I guess the phone right terminator 2
when he denied or so

874
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:08,140
the Atari portfolios close enough the
Atari portfolio

875
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,109
was something about the size Anna to
Lord Hardie hand-held

876
00:51:12,109 --> 00:51:16,460
and John Connor use one in the movie the
hack into an ATM

877
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:20,710
as a fictional portable computer hacking

878
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:24,380
this is called the Linus right top 86

879
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:29,280
it was the first commercially available
tablet computer

880
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,050
enough said

881
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:36,490
okay this is not what you think it is
most people say oh look

882
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:42,330
a brick phone a bag phone no this is
from 92 were so by IBM Corp assignment

883
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:45,380
in from all the research to I've what

884
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:48,520
buy online from what I can tell this is
the first

885
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,190
smartphone the first time you want to
call PDAs cell phone to put him in the

886
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:53,680
same box

887
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,210
arm he had everything a modern
smartphone has in terms of absolute

888
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:00,630
one glaring exception PTA stuff

889
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:05,400
I cellular staff even had a predictive
keyboard feature

890
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,000
I had back saying but it didn't have was
web browser because the consumer web

891
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,460
didn't exist in 1993

892
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:16,920
email and I it was a flop but it was
over smartphone

893
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:21,569
so IBM noches hackers

894
00:52:21,569 --> 00:52:25,190
I this is a I don't know where how to
categorize this one this is Steven

895
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:28,520
I'm Roberts from the nomadic research
labs

896
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:33,109
and with this isn't this a mature is
this one yr or his first one

897
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:36,569
this is called the book he meant the big
electronic human engine eyes

898
00:52:36,569 --> 00:52:39,830
energize machine only two heavy

899
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:44,069
and I remember armed as a kid watching

900
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:49,170
this guy be inspired by this concept
eBay build a bicycle and he published

901
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:49,670
his

902
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,950
his writings while the child across the
United States

903
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:56,630
any you realize a log hit a solar a
solar I don't know you know how we would

904
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,339
publish

905
00:52:57,339 --> 00:53:01,960
and you know go the same time the head
you know phyllis him like Ghana

906
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,510
on on on the news of him going across
the country in the same type of thing is

907
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,170
an awesome

908
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:09,750
kind over use a laptop that looks like a
Toshiba

909
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:13,630
I'm there into the supply was later this
boy from there

910
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:17,620
the early nineties maybe maybe late
eighties but I think

911
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:21,040
I think also that can also be a ten year
model 200 a much year

912
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,400
a or your whatever it is but I mean it's
it's I believe he was due this was one

913
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,270
of his later

914
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:30,930
from bicycle computers Heathrow this is
portable computing

915
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:34,770
in his eyes India I'm in a I N just to
come

916
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:37,780
come full circle so we start with the
computer the truck

917
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,839
we ended with a beard bicycle our bill
mention the funny

918
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:44,509
the what behemoth meant one thing I
forgot to mention I mention will be Dec

919
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:48,330
predicted for mobile digital computer
engineers are so it will be Dec because

920
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:48,990
well

921
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:53,020
art was manufactured by Sylvania and was
one in Massachusetts that was on our

922
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:53,910
mobile version

923
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:57,950
so the engineers called it Richard Dec

924
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:01,350
I okay next slide so as much in so you

925
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:04,580
be used to call me to let a greater
computing hobbyists communist out there

926
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,940

and I have the disease one other things
have been looking to do is to repair the

your questions for future reference

941
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:11,260
should anyone ask there was a disembowel
disembodied

00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:14,940
handy 100 in the handlebar

943
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,990

945
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,660
back in Lee 40's early 50's the lab
built a couple

946
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:31,990
or at least prototyped some wires is
quasi portable fire control computers

947
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:32,910
for the military

948
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:37,368

you're thinking abt Reddick

949
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:40,770
yeah arm trick was the train just a ride
to a computer

950
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:44,830
won the first two transistor computers
it was portable in that was meant to

951
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:46,799
write on the b-52's reporters

952
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,760
I will

953
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:57,760
many more questions on it now he burning
yet

954
00:55:59,869 --> 00:56:03,010
