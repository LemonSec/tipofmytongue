1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,050
topic protected said no one can come in
and you shoppin

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,950
no one's getting them good that works
when they when we get a sample

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,210
too late for them but in between them
their plight a lot of money and I'm

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,670
of the biggest your money in the Bolivar
down I'll

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,190
okay when we got here something simple
also snowboard pants

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,359
going after four directly are recording
only on them

7
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,990
a nice technique it should be handled by
a bunch from our to nice you to

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,750
configure okay

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,609
we know something about which what you
have on your phone me know that you got

10
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:28,439
like up

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,960
to interactive voice response system for
you go press one for this press two for

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,399
that

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,690
press to get an actual operator maybe
maybe not you only get one of those

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,790
we have attacks like that where the
actual cornelia their first one was the

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,730
academic thing nothing was colder

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,899
economic names like dick tough order
ideologue /url

17
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:47,930
I feel that was cool am

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,199
sound como que was called something else
before but I was trademark violation or

19
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:52,780
whatever

20
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,890
there in fridge and some other
trademarks in addition to some calmer

21
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,160
a sound up minor I was always call

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,050
found comer basing this recording audio
of my viewers had a database of

23
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,720
where you were the the pauses where the
uses and asked me what your credit card

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,090
number

25
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,590
if you could number press pound they got
the audio converter to sound

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,210
upstart two digits and then could be did
it back to the attacker

27
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,560
a nice technique when did the that
actually used by by

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,430
real Mauer you know the guys are
economic money ok sorry

29
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,750
home side well how long would I have
before

30
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,799
O'Shea I'll

31
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,190
okay let's skip look at got 10 minutes
let's keep us all as prop

32
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:43,039
there right I got a good stories about
that better deal

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,820
I skipped off updates one update stay on
topic that's pretty much it to come up

34
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,170
magic toppings offer

35
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,240
exhibit now realize that said okay
regular suffered us up

36
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,729
we got to that you're doing that now
greater to get nothing personal but

37
00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:00,330
I okay um

38
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,280
that's pretty much it for power up its
an official you don't see on the not

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,920
interesting

40
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,220
they're nice to good good thing didn't
and I'm awards are doing now

41
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,630
and very useful hype better stories from
like her who offered up

42
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,840
I okay route exploits very common

43
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,410
what we're finding is that the bad guys
they're basically using the same for

44
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,359
X what's written a book for when you can
go top the reason same ones we got like

45
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,860
20 30 40 on whatever

46
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,900
up and yes we attacked them that's
pretty much it basically

47
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,530
there are so many different ways things
you can do this thing where you can

48
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,510
update your phone or I could differ on
it like

49
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,880
they're not wasting my the bad guys are
wasting money developing techniques is

50
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,400
he okay with us we package our stuff

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,769
and get on to making the money that
you're there check really nice really

52
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:41,320
useful

53
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,650
really annoying but we picked them up
because they are leading up to the use

54
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,530
the same exploits on matter what you do

55
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,079
it in the file we detected and then you
never noticed that you didn't have some

56
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,340
kinda routing exploiting the expected to
see in that app

57
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,920
like you didn't want to root your phone
we tell you which is good

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,340
but the lazy so you know we catch them
okay

59
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,370
up but can you check next to the more
interesting part

60
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,760
up basic a new technique is fraud you
pretend to be another app

61
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,690
but with these are basically I'm are two
outs one is one quick fought wanna stay

62
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,650
talk if they took him to be when those
are

63
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,120
bank token generators in like like an RC
talking are similar

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,079
you launch the app gives you go two up
access your bank with your password

65
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,440
using your popular with them

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,040
the boy with the frog is that unlike
overrunning check it out for an infected

67
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,440
ap

68
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,230
should have a legitimate opposition were
coated in this is what the majority of

69
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,250
code in red basically is all the Maori
choltitz pretending to be much

70
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,799
up a relapse but he really is ninety 92
100 percent pushes cock

71
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,690
really interesting at fraud versus
injecting Cup

72
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,250
ourself a token little bit colder ABC
tears okay put your card trailer we were

73
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,379
once wrote two or three banks I don't
think this one is specifically

74
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,179
and basically they just put up a fake or
do you think you're taking your PASOK

75
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,930
you give them your pastor the doctors
name your

76
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,599
your whatever mideast acted ap a get a
bucket acting any taxes okay I'll take

77
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,160
out and I'll start spending your money

78
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,000
by technicolour need to get it on it
doesn't actually do anything that's the

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,560
thing I fought

80
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,930
the Sprint African and time but it
doesn't do anything is a unique

81
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,680
then we got some it also doesn't do it
it makes a bit more money this is a nice

82
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,840
thing and yet I learn a bit more of your
children will happen to the guy I miss

83
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,220
I'm gonna get a quick is the fickle
ability mapped it out pops up every five

84
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,110
min to request for a certain amount of
money be sent to the attackers

85
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,820
it's a it's a fake ap how many people
eating which offer something like that

86
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,590
Michael Kidd to fake abductor money from
the left him a nap

87
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,849
probably no but i wouldnt mean AB to
Texas cool fall for this thing out

88
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:43,539
for burial likely in ESCO they're like
grabbing information infantryman from

89
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:46,229
your information your Google account
information to the attacker so they can

90
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:47,210
maybe see their account

91
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,190
baby really was more to make money we
actually follow this is Neil applesauce

92
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,240
at like yes we detected but to but

93
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,849
211 people actually paid the ideal gas
money

94
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:04,169
at about a nine thousand users don't
install a two hundred people have three

95
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:04,690
percent

96
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,010
pay the money and and uncomfortable by
two hundred but when he was 21

97
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,539
okay is that you

98
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:15,960
I don't I got this of other reports but
basically it's a

99
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,010
a 20 21 million yen which she I guess
like about my other one thing to a sixty

100
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,219
five eight thousand dollars from

101
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,919
211 people for a fake after doesn't do
anything

102
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,280
it just pops up a window to pay me money
in and

103
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,890
people for Wow okay the nice thing can
you tell us about that

104
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,650
yes they picked up six people wanted
them to know of urself

105
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,990
don't do that as one if I guess people
are dumb but come on

106
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,650
they caught them pretty quickly and
relatively good lasts a month or so they

107
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,450
picked up a whole bunch to pick up the
rest the people of latin

108
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:52,280
good technique the truck okay something
more interesting little funny ROM

109
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,580
there's a obviously it reduced dow
called Stamper

110
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,200
a macabre reputed to be like a and admit
recipe I happen but instead of giving a

111
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,190
recipe xoxo kit

112
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,419
this item from fraud where the app can
be fake is injecting code word just like

113
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:06,409
a virus were

114
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:09,800
be a Mauer in for is infected into the
apt to attend

115
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,229
cream coat plus p.m. our comps life it's
a start

116
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:17,539
so you'll see the blue coat is a
legitimate code followed by some

117
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:18,460
infected codec

118
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,130
it's a little bit different the nice
thing was just up for a bomb you're all

119
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,899
your photos on your honor in your

120
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:27,870
St cock you got all your family photos
and then this thing possible image the

121
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,070
committee is I talk to many on your
photos

122
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,930
everything love them wouldn't be so bad
you know if it didn't

123
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,210
if it actually check to see what's
affecting like a standard founder

124
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,060
are you in fact if all you're looking to
head your settings a I'm but what about

125
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,510
the %ah be in fact yes

126
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,310
which is a good idea if you're lucky
blowing up the sizing it become easier

127
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,020
it doesn't do it doesn't check that so
it into damaging your flaps

128
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,919
actually that photo there an idiot over
200

129
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,279
is cooler whatever you know group the
deceased one you know you can be able to

130
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,089
do their part in everything what does
not make a single scheck you might

131
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:02,649
notice

132
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:06,870
a single check disinfected before how to
set up a pump up on the popular

133
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,969
but she would if I could look Erica

134
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:13,190
ok I got my photo here at for setting

135
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,710
Jan one Gentoo third-generation just

136
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,710
does really in good shape muscle ups are
present

137
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,620
cannot we've got another nice you know
but not the first aid needed it was

138
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,620
actually really simple didn't want to
modify this thing in turn to something

139
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,339
else

140
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:33,750
someone took this this tamper happened
and changing the engine you buried at

141
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,510
that goes after

142
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:41,669
found to be a Japanese pop group but a
KB 48 abuse called

143
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,719
these guys a guest list it is real life

144
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:50,390
okay about Japanese pop and not three
people actually more like 65 people

145
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,690
they have what's called me in and
elections where they've endured fans

146
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,849
vote for who because this is the big
troop

147
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:58,810
only some of them can perform like a
stage show so it's like a little bit

148
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,510
like 10 a model like 65 and vote on them

149
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,800
an election so that with election having
recently a few months ago

150
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,490
right when this app came out to be
sweetened go after found two that up you

151
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,099
down outfits will be voting for this
accused result in this election

152
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:16,580
and instead they got into a little love
Creek like I told when you get instead

153
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,380
a picture I love %uh a little baby that
was the the year said example from one

154
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,640
account it'll last year

155
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,140
wearing you could have it what would
your baby and when are these girls look

156
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:30,250
like

157
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,380
yes so now you get a picture of you all
your photos your family or friends

158
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,740
whatever you whatever it is

159
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,169
with this on every single one with the
same effect as the other a nap

160
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,069
so the ayatollah is going to got Laden
the person you baby

161
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,290
the brick you baby or BBQ

162
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,610
a look at some academic research real
quick got tap water another parent above

163
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,600
fourteen before we're in a

164
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,410
you you got the soft keyboard you touch
the if he is an intercourse up

165
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,689
so you're so you want to clean the apt
and Norton previous research had like

166
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,850
two parts a separate reading up on it
and a separate

167
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,920
actual the user data from there so you
push the button to new readers centers

168
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,969
you gotta figure out where these numbers
are you so

169
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,270
you could either make people happy hit a
nap it looks like this but the regular

170
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,170
login ap

171
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,339
or login screen or you can make it an
icon game where you collect

172
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,070
actually take on torch happen to be
where the one through nine and zero in

173
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,970
all our

174
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,089
my stick so they may even though this
day much academic put together a nap the

175
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:25,850
dust that

176
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,480
and put a one-out which can life but
will deep sea port is

177
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,250
be a poop on academic time but we
haven't yet seen the bad guys do it yet

178
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,779
actors made a lot of new things and
adopting that yet

179
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:41,290
and how many bets or take a picture for
months maybe maybe not

180
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,769
Aruna it depends depends on how much
money you can make biking to getting

181
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:46,610
your your your access card

182
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,380
and the key is a good idea how to do it
where they pick up information from the

183
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:51,970
app

184
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,220
my second but more interesting is
professional racers as everyone here

185
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,610
heard a bouncer

186
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,950
miss this is the new security are not
system set up whatever from Google for

187
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,100
you cleaning the apt for all these bad
after talking about here

188
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,370
and we see at some work on like last
month bob a good

189
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,480
no researchers John over-hyped Charlie
Miller and they they basically

190
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,560
came together and said let's build a man
up and get into store in China what is

191
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,920
just don't know how does it work

192
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,099
couldn't get worse any information on
this it is security obscurity

193
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,590
no one knows where it is the baguette Oh
No worst part the good guys and I we

194
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,140
have no idea so what do they do

195
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,290
so wacky wouldn't load it would have
been on for John alright known for

196
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,630
particular lot of a captain and restore
like eclipse trap which was a pretty big

197
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,120
well I pick you up it was like possibly
appear for Twilight Eclipse like show

198
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,680
you like pictures and all I could stop

199
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,800
but it really did was hit the download
needed by nurse from his server

200
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,760
taken at doctor phone with the latest
would actually be fined or not good

201
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,150
technique very nice

202
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,209
this not only 12 and kill you like two
images but said there was a preview of a

203
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,910
man than the one in the map it's ok sam
walked

204
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,150
but he only saw okay %uh same thing
Charlie Miller he put together I saw

205
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,260
stock market up until the stock prices

206
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,060
and download go don't like your iPhone
got him down from other Apple Store for

207
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,290
or app developer program per year also
shot he wasn't on he said let's go after

208
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,219
Google

209
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,730
to good guys okay so what is bound to
relieve on Tuesday it's mostly a good

210
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,860
first look I have these out of order

211
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,110
to go to the to the intro first I'll
yeah basically designed to like she is

212
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,720
your output not how to do it

213
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,570
their own apt lyndon overhead and Miller
that was basically

214
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,160
its government it should be a Google
Search app for system and got loaded up

215
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,140
and the comment that you could actually
a nap without paying any money also a

216
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,220
when I stick it on a few good things
there

217
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,100
but the interesting part is this up
because i connect actual doctor

218
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,230
overriding in Miller and they're able to
a

219
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,800
exploited system and see what what is
don't read it's apparently a nice little

220
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,220
up

221
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,880
it a customized version of the ESA mami
there that have been the Android SDK

222
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,660
and allows you to and there's also a
bunch of including a human cabana where

223
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,290
some unlikely run the card

224
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,860
they mentioned probably in their speech
you were the scene or not to be too I

225
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,550
think girl

226
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,540
monomer both in my meeting later on at
another commentator on

227
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,349
particu- takeaway is that now while they
were exploring with this is cut back

228
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,310
shell into Google's network they are
exploring the VM

229
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,210
occasionally found out they were
actually gonna run commands against the

230
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,910
the interpreter and went on it turned
out they were talking to

231
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,380
an actual human tester at the same time
like a someone's

232
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,640
playing with our apt what we do yes %uh
they try to avoid that but

233
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,110
the point is a Google's trying hard fine
it actually

234
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,100
do security on Android economy could
better make it more difficult to keeping

235
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,220
the bad guys out

236
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,530
law to keep the good guys out me know
Charlie and Jonathan on

237
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,449
I'm not sure affected that s now but I
mean give us information we can do a

238
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,340
better job

239
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,110
other one resort activities like the guy
putting a title on your pictures and I

240
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,490
mean

241
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,380
what we gonna do we need more
information like %ah and and basically

242
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,860
don't have a nice technique and and
it'll run chopper a five minute in a VM

243
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,910
and tells you it did

244
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,319
it's basically does what a lot of or
denounced tools we use against

245
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,600
are relied on our see what is working on

246
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,840
and eight billy goat was in the same
thing did not talk to any of the

247
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,410
neighborhood arson in security field

248
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,709
even though we've made approaches you
know I mean please talk to us know and

249
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,780
work with us we have that we're all
going to the same spot

250
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,110
up they're not doing any of that what
they're doing is busy running their own

251
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,120
and they put together a VM the house one
picture I think it was a picture Lady

252
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,000
Gaga it had like one contact and has
like a

253
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,430
to one user I like its nice little
through maybe an automated happens I'm

254
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,310
gonna fool an actual attacker

255
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,400
it's not gonna do a lot for for and talk
to sell gonna do anything for the entire

256
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,640
vetting process so I stain

257
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,670
nod I could a normal ap until I didn't

258
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,070
six months on while i connect your app
longer in your infected found in a

259
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,680
medium

260
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,220
house in France I'd like to be another
talk at that arm

261
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,220
black at been now at ended months with a
different company a different

262
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,580
researchers who are

263
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,680
I'll what are they doing to exact same
thing going after darting what's going

264
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,930
on and what isn't

265
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,040
and the key being is bad guys are
getting better they're still making

266
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,260
money on a special going after APs

267
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,150
whether we get the same tools to go
after them to see what they're doing and

268
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,870
and get along with that I want

269
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,410
I'm not sure how much more time how

270
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,689
ok cook it okok ok America BAC which
will be here are some other ones I

271
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,480
skipped over 101

272
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,880
can hold on okay what's this thing okay
kinda cover that

273
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,689
they looked over and I was gonna need
the basic guys are very creative are

274
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,800
going after Google

275
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,400
these are the good guys did not know
what you're doing we haven't quite seen

276
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
not getting the Tigers pace or not

277
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,420
shooting people trying any reason really
genius for trucks immediately

278
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,190
let's put together a lapdance be
something else and send it out there

279
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,990
I'm guessing not mainly the attackers
are somehow we sing like the last you're

280
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,710
looking at a live how people making
money off a

281
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:46,450
up something okay addicting with SMS to
doing with with botnets and we are

282
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,450
actually help but %uh there was a talk
about an Android phone and sending out

283
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,520
Yahoo spam mail last month

284
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,819
no couple weeks ago I and i was a good
tonight its Android but I think there

285
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,180
was a a researcher from Microsoft maybe
to an engineer for max up to

286
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,140
talked about like apostle and why bother
she doesn't have the ass

287
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,630
in China mainly but not if she doesn't
have the they exist I blogged about

288
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,680
hotel in my last year

289
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,940
are sorry I accident protection on the
last year and it's like

290
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,130
big sis their real for online number
platforms

291
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,730
so it's not a surprise but we didn't see
any that are any evidence that with this

292
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,440
is so called Android but I would be
mellow sending us to e-mail

293
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,520
no real presence so many Viva Google
says isn't proper outcome I call you

294
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,600
said no it's not really a botnet

295
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,180
I am which would not reveal westinghouse
family that would get caught by boxer

296
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,350
moments I mean we're there are two
control endemic solenoids

297
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:41,150
but we're not seeing a a lot of skill on
the part of the attackers on Android

298
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:45,640
maybe on on my iPhone which saw sticks
how about Marshall kill to get onto if

299
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,170
you're an attacker

300
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,710
maybe we're not accusing them when in
the wild going after everybody

301
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,790
we are seeing is that the talks after I
guess so

302
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:59,209
low-hanging fruit pretty much nom suffer
some kind of a SMS something lower per

303
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,140
gallon aP's

304
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,620
people who downloaded a dollar to man up
and keeping it

305
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,940
don't of numbering 211 people out of
nine thousand

306
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,650
he still three percent is still high for
what I expect for some night out i mean

307
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,140
cuz

308
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,390
we've won across on a new job all the
time where was not using

309
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,699
gun double mobile app's and coming out a
basically %ah to Russia been pretty much

310
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,000
it's like a bigger

311
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,390
a subset OVA now working like a mad at
their base in bed either

312
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:29,589
fake porn taps or fake traps you think
you're getting one or the other

313
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:33,779
and you end up wouldn't pay money and
the fact election works is the most

314
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,270
amazing thing ever I mean

315
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,220
you're already stealing things are going
after party popper you're paying money

316
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,450
it's not quite as good as did the PC
want to tell you okay yeah I

317
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,410
we're gonna sundered mission
accomplished something out you're in

318
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,550
trouble over

319
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,180
not even not address registered give us
money and people just give the money

320
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,330
9 are we on the wrong business just

321
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:57,360
Italy yes yes ASAP people are so stupid
but

322
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,900
I don't think so but from know what
sucks the phrase earlier the comment arm

323
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,500
I'll YouTube record every time we try to
make it full proof for the good natured

324
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,559
was about a fool's

325
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:16,559
to go something like that

326
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,920
actually pretty much a public over the
%uh play stuff really when in Austin on

327
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,790
up its color

328
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,889
reflect back on chart really isn't John
to techniques they both tried basically

329
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,520
a

330
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,770
out to be going to be something else and
I'll did God made by names like I can

331
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,310
exploit

332
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,760
basically no and up it is a very common
thing like on the PC where you

333
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,960
get onto the visor on your PC first a
disturbing your weight in your likely

334
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,150
compromise machine

335
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,670
maybe not fully but you're waiting and
you download additional colder better

336
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,130
a softer on to fall on today and on your
PC

337
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,360
and you exploit the fix for the PC which
is

338
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,340
the way to depend on like over the last
10 years it's been done

339
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,320
now we're trying to see on on on the
mobile and for some reason number one
