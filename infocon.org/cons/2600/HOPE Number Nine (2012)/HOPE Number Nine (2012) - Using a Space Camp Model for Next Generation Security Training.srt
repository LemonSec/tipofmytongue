1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,669
Standard Time good morning hope I am

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:09,410
more thanks to our CR and we'll move on
to next time and this regard it's called

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,719
a use myspace can model for
next-generation security training

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,959
and I would like to present our speakers
are marked a bias

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,600
Tammy Blackwell and David Fidler a
pleasure to be here I'm

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,330
or give you a brief introduction to our
team I am my name is Mark device on the

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,949
lawyer and physical security specialist

8
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:30,180
and I lead a team I

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,420
that work for all the major la companies
in the world

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,460
we figure out how to compromise

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,880
high-security locks in moisture out
affect some absorb guys like us can get

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,520
in your home

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,080
tummy blackwell is our pH the

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,300
education administration and she's part
of our team she ran Space Camp

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,600
at Huntsville Alabama for 12 years homie
you guys are from a US Space Camp

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,690
okay grade well should they have now won
six hundred thousand kids through space

17
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,509
camp are very very popular program.
tommie Ryden

18
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:10,660
rare for 12 years I'm we have a team
that's put together

19
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,190
I that will talk about and then David
Fidler is a high school student

20
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,100
his dad and I work together I his dad is
our code word entry specialist makes

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,630
tools for governor

22
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,030
and I'm we thought David would be
actually more relevant than matter was

23
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,390
forced me on this panel

24
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,430
because we're targeting high school and
college kids we want your import

25
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,750
so we're gonna go through a each slide
presentation and then we would like

26
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,750
questions I'm we actually did this

27
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:43,369
eight years ago at Hope I in July 2004

28
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,680
and but now were we have something to
talk about

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,689
so we're looking at a security cam based
on the Space Camp model

30
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,900
I in the whole 2004

31
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,920
I talked about a concept at that point

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,869
%uh than a title the talk was Harry
Potter meets reality

33
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:05,600
I'm what we proposed was

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,610
the real hard words up for security
training

35
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,570
and to get kids into a security
curriculum so that they would

36
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:18,140
I get involved in security and and
pursue it as a career

37
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,900
I'm and at that time we talked about a
failure of imagination

38
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,110
and that's where our team deals with
every day

39
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,840
in physical security designs in the
locks and safes

40
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,700
and there's a real problem on the part
of a lotta manufacturers

41
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,480
they understand how to make things work
but they don't understand how to break

42
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,100
'em

43
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,630
and what we teach engineers worldwide is
how to break things

44
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,030
I'm sure absorb like destructive
ten-year-olds

45
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,560
and sorrow out but we're talking about
there's a lot of security camps out

46
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,870
there and boot camps

47
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,519
but we're talking about a very immersive
high-tech environment

48
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,750
I just like the space get my own Tommy
can talk about that a little bit

49
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,829
I'm the security threat has escalated
since 2004

50
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:07,370
obviously as things are become more
computerized

51
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,290
the the threats were escalated I the
Pentagon now has a Cyber Command

52
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,578
a cenar I like big problem but the

53
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:21,199
vision was a hard words Academy that
does the real fans

54
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,410
iron we want to teach in

55
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,690
me up original idea that lay dormant for
a while

56
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,949
wires that we could bring high school
and college kids into a very very

57
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:34,699
high-tech environment

58
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:38,930
and start teaching the basics and really
getting turned on the security

59
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,389
I and dude teach them the basics are the
road rules

60
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,410
in cyber and physical and forensics

61
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,709
and at the end of the day provide

62
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:55,070
a strategic labor well I love very sad
security sabri employees

63
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,400
I and so that that was the original idea

64
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,100
the media covered I'm we had some
subsequent meetings

65
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,549
right after that the 9/11 Commission
came out with a scathing analysis of the

66
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:08,269
governor

67
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:11,780
and the reason in at least in part the
9/11 happened

68
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,290
is because it was a total failure for
magic nation on the part of the governor

69
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,180
so and that was a coverage in USA today

70
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,370
I am basically

71
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,590
the intelligence community bed they
actually new 9/11 was coming but they

72
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,440
couldn't believe it

73
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,620
what we do is we

74
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,630
think out of the box and analyze threats

75
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,969
and figure out in our world a physical
security how to

76
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,650
eg figure out what the threat is how to
exploit it and then how to fix it

77
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,000
and so what we're really looking for

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,189
years really bright

79
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:52,389
motivated bored kids that

80
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:55,840
think they might wanna go into security
me

81
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,449
mess like so 2010

82
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:05,530
we started I really looking at the
security camp concept in earnest

83
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,539
I we had meetings with industry and
government leaders

84
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:13,900
two years analysis the problem in really
what was going on in america

85
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,889
and around the world as far as security
cams to make sure wasn't already being

86
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:18,840
done

87
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,050
are we met with several different
universities are we mad

88
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,099
two different national laboratories a
and we met with

89
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:30,889
law enforcement and forensic
investigators all over the country

90
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:34,139
I what we came up with a is intense

91
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:39,030
it is a definition of a security
intelligence lab

92
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,150
and and what we call the SI seven
Academy

93
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,180
Sol the problem

94
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:53,180
today is that the government feels that
we are short by 10,000 to 30,000

95
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:55,680
security specialist

96
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,770
to protect this country that's a lot the
real question is where do you get a

97
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,810
because you can't instantly create a
security specialist reader cyber

98
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,370
physical security

99
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,789
I started picking locks when I was 15 in

100
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:15,659
and it took me a long time to acquire
the expertise and skills

101
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:19,030
to thirdly the team that I do today I

102
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,280
it's not instant but you have to start
somewhere

103
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,530
so the threat to the United States as
you are aware

104
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:32,180
I Facebook for example 600,000 times a
day they're attacked

105
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,900
the pentagon is is repeatedly attacked
every day

106
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,229
I am everybody's attacked as you know

107
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:43,699
the costs I'm an attack the media in

108
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:49,990
is 3.8 million dollars to infrastructure
to banks to insurance companies

109
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,990
to critical infrastructure I am

110
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,069
the last five years there's been twenty
eight hundred-plus

111
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:01,280
infrastructure attacks have been
documented the chinese have a

112
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,300
I've have our government program
government policy to attack

113
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,300
our infrastructure and some of my
associates are working investigations

114
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,949
involving for example the Chinese
hacking into law firms

115
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:17,469
that handle intellectual property
applications for patents

116
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:20,699
because it's a lot easier to steal the
intellectual property the developer

117
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:21,669
yourself

118
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:24,719
and approach you five years ahead Sol

119
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:27,960
every major company in the United States
has got a problem

120
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,610
I and work I can really tell you wills

121
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,870
security if you get into it and and
obviously that's the goal

122
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,180
years is a fascinating endeavor once you
understand what's going on

123
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,270
so obviously it's a digital world

124
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,389
everything is digital everything is
microprocessor controlled microprocessor

125
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:50,180
embedded

126
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,580
so what's at risk everything

127
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,719
Sol the other problem is the FBI which
is the primary investigative

128
00:07:57,719 --> 00:07:59,969
jurisdiction under just us

129
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:03,029
Bay the inspector general found that
they

130
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:06,789
really really lacked resources in their
field offices

131
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:11,330
because they are inundated now obviously
the secret service is also involved

132
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,370
by very inundated and

133
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,879
with the first of all a lot of attacks
aren't even discovered

134
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,309
and there's not enough investigative
talent to deal with it

135
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:25,979
so there's a lotta government action in
this area

136
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,930
the national security agency is involved
in funding

137
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,570
a different schools in different
education curriculum

138
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,490
the Department of Homeland Security
obviously is also involved

139
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,260
but the efforts are you sensually

140
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,350
uncoordinated it isn't that they're good
efforts

141
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,950
but they're on coordinated and are
boulders a number of schools have action

142
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,740
once around the country and these are
increasing

143
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,600
I'm there's not enough from and there's
not enough kids coming out at the

144
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,390
school's

145
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,069
to serve industry and government so

146
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,130
the current academic solutions

147
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,949
I'm lemme lead Tommy address that

148
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:10,589
and talk about that just a little bit
and then where that where we go from

149
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:11,370
there

150
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,050
well many universities on are offering
degrees in time security you now

151
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,050
written but these courses a deluded by
other academic

152
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,100
on courses and also

153
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,160
not many cue the interim on this field
thou there is really not

154
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,310
om a special emphasis on physical
security

155
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,990
and it's certainly not integrated with
our security issues

156
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,449
so actually one part of what we wanna do

157
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:42,229
is to any inspire young kids and give
them a Batman

158
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:48,339
are so that they can up be motivated to
enter the zombie majors in universities

159
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:51,410
and hopefully we can get some
scholarships for these kids because

160
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,620
right now

161
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,630
the nation is not investing the time and
money

162
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,149
and attention are too %uh to this feel

163
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:02,389
in order to I get kids involved

164
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:06,529
and right now what we have is
combination camps going down

165
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:10,410
are you familiar I'm sure with the US
that a challenge is made up of three

166
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,779
different

167
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,939
are challenges all are web-based the the
forensics

168
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,139
challenge the net wars and the fabric
Patriots defense challenge

169
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:23,959
and then what's happening years arm the
government is

170
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:27,170
selecting the best to the best from
those challenges

171
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,769
Fabrice stages the Haskell program its
every where you is all over the world

172
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:32,070
many

173
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,560
is again just a web-based program is not

174
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,269
are complete tienen anyway so we feel
that we need more than games

175
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:44,570
and we need more than workshops lot of
conferences have workshops like death

176
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,180
can for example

177
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,709
about their brief day usually a few
hours a one-day

178
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:53,199
we need more than university classroom
courses we need more than adult

179
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:56,759
certification programs but professional
organizations

180
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:00,269
what we need is an immersive security
training

181
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:05,430
Academy om cell that's what we're
putting together a very different kind

182
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,940
Academy

183
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,009
we were on a different kind of trainees
we want them we want the day be to the

184
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:13,870
world we want the bright motivated young
people

185
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,500
and we want to use Basecamp a hot tech
model

186
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,820
om for this academy the what we want to
do and what we are planning to do

187
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,459
is did bill arm the Chronicle cyber and
diesel security

188
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:30,670
physical security with real threats
Milton il's

189
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,149
high-tech tools and simulated
environments so

190
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:37,740
Tommy talk about space camp because
that's where you're all professional

191
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,870
experiences

192
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,620
with lots and lots and lots a kid's yes
well

193
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,019
hell yeah I can't see at a beer well but
I had no I'm group are you in the front

194
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:51,160
are familiar with Basecamp any help
actually attended Space Camp

195
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,589
them could be an awfully some hand out
there

196
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,079
well rather be they have attended and
maybe that is that you know that space

197
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,589
can't know that

198
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:02,690
on its from a week to

199
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,720
back to met her guns would be two weeks
and

200
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,250
the program to graduated from the little
gathered all the way up to 99 urals week

201
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,430
we have corporate camps we have on
teacher camps New Year

202
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,449
international cams and Space Camp two
located all over the world have

203
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:23,940
nope you know that not met the mother
facility is in Huntsville Alabama

204
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,940
their two more facilities in the United
States in an one in Canada

205
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,170
I Belgium Japan and turkey

206
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:37,410
Space Camp Turkey %uh now these camps
succeed because they don't

207
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,050
just give you theory are you don't just
get to in a rare

208
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,480
with the Stars of on space exploration

209
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,880
the engineers the rocket scientist the
astronauts and so forth

210
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,250
but you actually and the simulated
environment you have placed

211
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,569
inside in immersed an the mission

212
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,639
so you train an astronaut simulators

213
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,199
you are perform the mission just as an
asset not

214
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:08,620
would it is time elapsed are you

215
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:14,399
feel you are really and and the are same
environment that an astronaut with bien

216
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,990
is a matter of that one

217
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,420
one other wonderful things I got to do
its base camp was

218
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,009
when arm Ron Howard was producing apollo
thirteen

219
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:28,509
arm we got to train Tom Hanks in Ron
Howard and

220
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:32,180
Kevin Bacon and the crew per week
mccarthy's

221
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,360
them the nearest thing that you can get
to the real Chinese

222
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,040
I'm an astronaut but the point years com

223
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,500
there's no such thing that exist in the
physical and cyber security world

224
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,069
now we want to take this model this
space can't model

225
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:50,069
and apply it to the arm

226
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:54,829
security time so from concept to plan
here's what we've been doing the last

227
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:57,480
two years and why we're here today

228
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,930
we assess the need and what is missing
for students

229
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,699
I we assessed what's lacking in present
training

230
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:10,290
and how to get young people into a
security curriculum

231
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,469
and how to prepare students for careers
in security

232
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,709
how to augment what is already in place
huh

233
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:21,670
then we had to select a venue which was
no small task

234
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,379
establish a legal infrastructure and
obtain funding

235
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:29,819
so in June of 2012 after meeting with

236
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:33,800
the National Laboratories several major
universities

237
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,060
and commercial facilities iron

238
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,319
we selected a venue I am

239
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:44,680
and we wanted the venue to be one

240
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,589
above the national centers of excellence
that was established by the National

241
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:50,250
Security Agency

242
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,250
so we chose from many universities

243
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,860
I'll we were ok Ridge National Lab we
were at the University of Washington

244
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,769
I which has an extremely good
cybersecurity program

245
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:05,430
oMG we held a cyber security summer

246
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,889
air with the city of Huntsville Alabama
we bend the Def Con at meetings we did a

247
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:14,800
Yale security summit last September were
60 kids

248
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,329
from MIT y'all Harvard and the
University New Haven

249
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:23,779
now we've been to the University of
Cambridge in England University Rhode

250
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:24,620
Island

251
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,959
I'll we were out in Honolulu meeting
with their educational people in police

252
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:35,170
I we're at the HTC I A in the high-tech
investigation Association Lana

253
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,170
and finally at the co 2 State University
in

254
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,230
a Madison South Dakota so

255
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,290
we finally chose not because I live in
South to court although

256
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:50,370
actually I'm everybody asked for my
address is actually see tree beyond

257
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,480
Delta

258
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,600
I because I travel so much mom

259
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,269
Dakota State University was founded in
nineteen eighty her 1881 as a teacher's

260
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:01,589
college

261
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:05,089
about thirty years ago the governor our
state

262
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:10,800
after discovering the Internet decided
that's out the corner should be the most

263
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,319
wired state in the world

264
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:18,850
and soul we actually he's trained about
200 inmates in our state penitentiary

265
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,230
and they went in wired every single
classroom public and private in South

266
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,870
Dakota with cat 5

267
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,759
so we had distance learning and we had
internet when the internet caught up

268
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,250
with what we did

269
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,199
Sol Dakota State is a very small school

270
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:38,560
I it's got about three thousand students
but they're one of the National centers

271
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,120
of excellence it's a safe environment

272
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,079
and they have a really unique program

273
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:51,029
that Kim stand up to any in the universe
major universities in the country

274
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:53,660
want to talk a little bit about the
issue and then we'll tell you what we're

275
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,180
doing

276
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,899
well there there's so many
qualifications believe it or not even

277
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,620
though it's very small university

278
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,240
course you know that it was ninety by on
an essay at the National Center

279
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,579
act actually is National Center for
Academic Excellence in cybersecurity

280
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:10,909
and they offer many cans have degrees
there that you would

281
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,339
might be surprised about on the BS in
Computer & network security

282
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:18,599
actually if you get a teaching degree
from there you still have to have a

283
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,120
major

284
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,160
a manner and technology which is a good
thing

285
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,350
they offer the massive Science in
Information Assurance

286
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:30,459
arm they've written books they have
wonderful faculty members

287
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,200
I'll name had created a conference
called the color con

288
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,270
that we attended last year that was on

289
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,350
attended by know maybe several hundred
students from around the area

290
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,360
not not like yes but pretty good for
that area but it's growing

291
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,590
the the real relevant issue as they've
got the best instructors

292
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:54,419
and they've got physical facilities and
we're looking at building

293
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,150
a very sophisticated physical facility
that will talk about

294
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:03,120
then recently they've been named are one
and the four universities in the United

295
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,250
States that would

296
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,150
after the sabra ops operations and
that's that there are big

297
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:13,050
their out %ah arm okay with on the Naval
Postgraduate School

298
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,800
in California Northwestern University a
massachusetts the University of Tulsa

299
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,760
and Oklahoma

300
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,370
cell it's quite prestigious ninety-six
percent

301
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,610
up there graduates go on to get jobs and
that should be appealing to

302
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,920
any any student in college right now

303
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,250
they give degrees up to the pH the level

304
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:38,080
and they have an absolutely superb
outstanding faculty is a matter fact one

305
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,070
in their physics

306
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,560
professors is world renowned and is
working with us

307
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,200
on this project use the Ted fellow I
don't know if you

308
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,210
know what did Anna Sol

309
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,930
the plan is to create a quantico space
camp for cyber

310
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,410
cyber and physical security and what you
need understanding as

311
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,820
all of the boot camp all of the security
camps

312
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,350
nobody's doing physical security and
physical security

313
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,870
is built in the cybersecurity yet every
level

314
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,970
and especially in my world love locks
and saves

315
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,740
electronics are integrating into all of
the locking systems

316
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,950
for all the server rooms for all the
buildings pretty soon all the buildings

317
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,970
are gonna be remotely programmable

318
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,850
with their door locks and Saul
everything is coming together

319
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:31,370
we can bring the best of both worlds
together we have commitments from major

320
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,310
significant instructors arm from
companies

321
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,379
and that are that are global in nature

322
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,140
to bring the real immersive environment
to teach students

323
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,350
about the basics of security and get
them into a curriculum

324
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:52,460
so the security intelligence lab to
deliver a unique continue our more

325
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,740
timely world-class immersive education

326
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,020
training and research in physical and
cybersecurity

327
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:05,100
then why is really simple to fill the
needs today

328
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,450
cell will do three things: actually
we're creating the umbrella called

329
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:14,510
security intelligence lab and under that
umbrella will do three different things

330
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,950
the first course in the dark blue

331
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,190
is com has to do more with research

332
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,220
and information sharing in conferences

333
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,090
talks workshops arm evaluating

334
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,840
the field making recommendations to
industry

335
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,810
actually helping industry by allowing
our students to

336
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:39,730
go and industry up take a look at
security systems both our and his

337
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,800
security breakdown and perhaps fix them

338
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,040
in the second piece will be the SR seven
Academy

339
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,090
under the Academy structure will offer
different kinds of academies from the

340
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:53,090
corporate security professionals all the
way down to

341
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:57,070
our citizens protection session the
first that will develop will be perhaps

342
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,970
girl in college students

343
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:03,330
and then of course we help to have
extensions internationally

344
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:08,240
arm satellite campuses and do product
development in publications

345
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,630
and the real trick yes our students

346
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,890
once they go through our basic lab will
be able to collaborate on security

347
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,790
problems

348
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,240
with their colleagues worldwide during
the school year

349
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,500
to solve problems for clients and
corporate sponsors

350
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,870
one of the things we want to be able to
do is to

351
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,850
mom actually help communities become
cyber

352
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,490
secure now of course we want to start
with Matt

353
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,510
South Dakota which is a small community
in breaking succeed there then

354
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:44,770
weekend ask a law okay so who's involved
in this project

355
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,480
we've been meeting with the most
distinguished experts

356
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,920
in cyber and physical security and
forensics at its forensic investigations

357
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,610
and these are the folks and physical
security in physics

358
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:04,190
in cyber I better going to be involved
there would be the best at the best

359
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,750
that you would be exposed to okay

360
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,210
so again we're talking about an
immersive training academy

361
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:16,000
advanced wars the best tools and
high-tech techniques in a vigorous

362
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,910
curriculum

363
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:21,250
I and it would be delivered in a
challenging high-tech environment

364
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,520
and the environment that we're looking
at designing

365
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,970
I'm is like Space Camp

366
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,790
with that scenario driven coursework
with gaming with competition with

367
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,659
lecturers

368
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,080
and collaboration with students and
sponsors

369
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,939
basically we want to teach everybody the
basics

370
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,130
and then how to think very alternatively
about solving

371
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,650
problems Tommy talk really briefly about
what would be

372
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,750
some of the areas in the camp this is
this is an example of the kind of thing

373
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,760
that will help

374
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,820
we are caught we're calling in a
technology vision village

375
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,439
I'll have things from the tavern to this
gif landing from fabric to

376
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,010
street where you can purchase are your
two

377
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,730
will have robotics room gaming on

378
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,170
will create them 3d environment like
magic in third the keyboard

379
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,340
on will have with Colin decide to buy

380
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,240
Alan do you know what the have been
valued in FBI examiner from a with

381
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,700
monica

382
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,970
at the FBI Academy it's a real life

383
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:31,520
um city that they've built the train
agents in different real-life scenarios

384
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,620
walking down the street is it a bank
robbers a victim as a hostage

385
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,520
the shoe do you not sure what do you do
we're going to do the same thing and

386
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,250
physical and cyber security

387
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:47,980
so basically we're going to combine all
these different disciplines

388
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,340
cyber identity theft locks and saves

389
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:56,520
I am so what we're talking about is very
technology wise young people

390
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,010
and the criteria to getting what he
sensually be imagination intelligence

391
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,500
and determination and talent I am

392
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,910
and to develop usable security skills &
ultimately become a high sought after

393
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,260
security professional

394
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:15,680
here's the bottom line: security means
employment and employment means job

395
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,070
security

396
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:20,450
and in this economy everybody's going to
be looking for that

397
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:26,150
a fax about the Academy we'll use the
next generation technology held in the

398
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,810
next

399
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:30,030
warden early futuristic immersive
environment

400
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:34,270
and the location is a safe location

401
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:39,900
and this is what we're looking at
building as far as the environment

402
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:44,840
and believe it or not has at were
agricultural state

403
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,350
what we're looking at is a really really
high tech geodetic dorm in the middle of

404
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,190
a corn field

405
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,890
which is next to the campus everybody
laughs

406
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:58,520
the thing about South Dakota's there's
no bureaucracy

407
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,110
and their it save there's recreation but

408
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:06,350
the best thing is we've got classrooms
we're looking at building this facility

409
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,930
in a dome-shaped

410
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:12,310
there would be very very futuristic that
would hold all the labs the classrooms

411
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:17,200
all the environment for learning these
critical tools

412
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,900
so what do we need from you why are we
here today we'd like your import just

413
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,400
like eight years ago when we started
this

414
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,200
important feedback creative support if
you take

415
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,830
are you mail address if you have any
import wheat really really appreciate it

416
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:37,649
I am we want your ideas and David as a
high school kid

417
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,860
would you come to this academy and why

418
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,140
Aug out a hundred percent good a sec add
me I feel it in need

419
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,900
for people start because we're being
brought up in the digital age in for

420
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,490
kids my age and younger in even older
alder I think it's unnecessary need for

421
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,010
people to be introduced to this new form
of security this new form of

422
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,370
on intelligence this keV lacking

423
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:04,080
in and modern day society I know a lot
of people

424
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,439
who just randomly get spyware and
malware

425
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,620
on the computers from doing random
random crap

426
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,780
and I think it takes a lot

427
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,280
love understanding but yet more

428
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,540
being introduced into the idea that
other so much more then

429
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,430
just arm clicking on a link or OpenID or
the key

430
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:29,200
a I think people to know the
vulnerabilities

431
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,960
in things to know how to fix them into
have more open and UN

432
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,870
and stuff so we would solicitor our
trouble lights

433
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:41,690
I'm we would really so massacres is why
we came in in New York this time

434
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,940
we would solicit questions ideas
suggestions

435
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,450
criticism I'm from you guys

436
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,690
because your who we would be doing this
for the University

437
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:56,950
the status out the car to everybody is

438
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,760
really really intrigued about this and
wanna make it work

439
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,750
and so now we're talking to funding
sources both government and private

440
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,590
and two corporate sponsors Anders

441
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:13,260
everybody's involved in this program now
it took a long time to get here

442
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,360
I'll we the reason we went to y'all

443
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,130
last last september west to determine
whether

444
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,440
the location really matters

445
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,510
and what we came away with six the kids
in a three-day intensive weekend wise

446
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:33,080
it doesn't matter if you have the
content

447
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,240
and frankly it's a lot easier to go to a
small city

448
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,680
by the way with a great lake and two
miles from the campus

449
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,580
and but the real trick is to learn
really intriguing

450
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,260
stuff soul I think there's microphones
with

451
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,030
really like to hear from you guys as far
as questions

452
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:59,389
important suggestions

453
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:03,560
yessir a high um actually am kind of an
interesting case

454
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,350
a.m. this next upcoming year will be
bought by a senior in high school and my

455
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,540
sophomore year college

456
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,090
that's cool ROM for something is a
brilliant idea

457
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,770
I actually live in Rapid City Arroyo is
going to be interesting and loved

458
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,560
working you

459
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,970
extensively with this I might give you
my cuz hey I've got my cards up here

460
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,420
when you're done if you guys

461
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,670
pleas for an my website his security

462
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:29,060
dot work really really easy to remember
I

463
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,510
everybody else how did you get there a
it's called 1995

464
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:39,520
I hours sitting in a million with some
colleagues at a at a our government

465
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,150
covert entry

466
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:46,680
gathering and I said you know it's about
time to get a website

467
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,370
believe it or not three weeks before
security dot com had been taken

468
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:56,240
and so we grab security .org in the rest
is history maybe some love you know me

469
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,370
from the lockpicking world and I'm

470
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:03,880
but we're really intrigued about this
this took a long time to get to where

471
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,730
we're at

472
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,800
and the National Labs are are

473
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,140
essentially on board telling us we're
also you know will help you

474
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,840
and so we want import alright so anyways

475
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,300
but my question behind this was are you
looking more at a program to actually

476
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,560
cultivate interest whether is none or
more to actually take the pre-existing

477
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,720
interest those who you know you as you
stated before already bright

478
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,510
interest in motivating kids and actually
harness them

479
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:35,770
and focus their energy are you looking
to actually cultivate

480
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,320
where I was the apathy in a lot of
schools be looking to cultivate that

481
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,179
into interest both are both are both
goals

482
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,330
because mark america's risk

483
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:51,379
as you guys all know were we gonna get
the experts

484
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,160
to protect the infrastructure government
and commerce

485
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,640
were together you have to get them
through schools

486
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,840
and we've gotta get kids into these
curriculums

487
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,230
security is fascinating now i solve
puzzles for a living

488
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,410
my background as law enforcement and a
lawyer

489
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:13,830
but I do physical security and fraud
investigations round-the-world

490
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,860
and but most my workers physical
security

491
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,620
we take things that cannot be broken

492
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,410
and we break up and sometimes we break
them in 10 20 30 seconds

493
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:30,390
that they suspect that these companies
we work force made millions and millions

494
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,980
of dollars to develop

495
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,850
they don't get it they're startin to get
because they're so embarrassed sometimes

496
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,900
but the bottom line is to make things
more secure and

497
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,410
both your points are valid we need to
intrigue kids and we need to get him

498
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,260
into a curriculum can I add to that just
a little bit too

499
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,310
%uh I think apathy

500
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:54,040
can be arm helped by

501
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,110
education just education but interest
really can't

502
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:02,580
um itself the students that have
absolutely no interest

503
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,970
in detail I think arm our program
probably is not going to turn them on

504
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:10,980
but apathy yes we can

505
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,770
we can educate them to what the problem
is and how I'll

506
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,639
this situation about our infrastructure
critical infrastructure for the united

507
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,490
states. in white

508
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:23,050
at moon is in the news every day
practically anyway but

509
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:27,080
up as far as training kids to go into
companies

510
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:33,040
and om work with corporations are get
more education and more training at the

511
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,830
University are high-level

512
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:39,020
we really need them technology USD don't
that has an interest

513
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,100
in this so the question and shiny how do
you do it and

514
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,420
because of Tommy's experience were Space
Camp

515
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,900
the way to do it we think is a really
immersive environment so you're living

516
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,240
security 24 hours a day and really
solving problems

517
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,470
well that's a trend billion your were
all and then up and at times already

518
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:03,420
and then recommend com which is what we
do is base camp we don't normally did

519
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,190
you end up like your mission go

520
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,630
wrong you get stranded in space and you
have to figure out how to get back

521
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:12,170
proper some other kids don't want to
come back I

522
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:16,800
does that answer your question editors
1181 one thing about their

523
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,600
is %uh is gonna be very useful to us to
now the winners are these big

524
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,320
on up contest these internet web-based
content light sabers stage for example

525
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,419
is gonna be useful to us to yet the kids
that have gone to

526
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,570
on Def Con the kids then have 60 that
won the award

527
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:40,790
Def Con on the kid that arm have gone to
boot camps for example

528
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:45,370
on DA's you had the big camp especially
for high school students

529
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:49,060
Arctic Arctic on and those are the kids
that I think would be interested in

530
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,889
coming to this academy but we're going
to scream

531
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,330
its grain them extensively will do

532
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,750
psychological evaluations will do other
Kansas grainy

533
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:02,520
19 him and he's going to get to come
because that gonna be a question from

534
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,540
wanna do you

535
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,730
have to you how do you decide who is
going to do

536
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,980
whitehead hacking and be ethical in
doing this

537
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,080
next question

538
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,030
so you can't let into my question an
intensely on the server compassion

539
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:23,570
I pick my first like its base camp good
yeah

540
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:27,520
so he asks yeah I i

541
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,139
well it leads into

542
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,520
to the what I guess we now call the
white had black hat grey hat

543
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,750
what hats discussion i'd

544
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,180
was one of those youngsters that did
things like that and

545
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,810
I was very very lucky that my parents
and my father on is actually here

546
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:49,280
with me at the in them you know he's out
in the field house

547
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,139
the redirected me from the these
pursuits that we're

548
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:57,650
less than good that age to using them
for good things to using them

549
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:01,550
in very least two ways it didn't get me
in trouble now this is also

550
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:05,320
15-20 years ago in the holidays we see
did

551
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,750
with all the words you you use to
describe the

552
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,750
risks to this country cyberattacks

553
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,168
I'm how do we encourage these kids

554
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:19,569
in in a way that cam ballot in

555
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,700
I wanted balances but encourages them
display

556
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,770
all these things they hear and works to
protect them from that environment where

557
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:30,780
what you guys really forced to
accentuate those skills that they

558
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,929
probably develop

559
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:36,830
independently and can get them into
trouble nowadays

560
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:40,590
how do you change with those in protect
them as you guys trying bro the skills

561
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,379
into something that is to be used for
good

562
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:46,560
yeah rally went on to say one thing I
was out in the heart of glass table

563
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,540
meeting with a retired Honolulu PD
detective

564
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,560
who has led the development of k12

565
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,879
program in Honolulu for the Hawaiian
school system

566
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,690
on exactly what you're talking about
thank online it's called safe online to

567
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,230
teach these kids

568
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,750
to be safe on the Internet and the legal
issues

569
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,740
cuz you can really get into trouble
easily and not think you're breaking

570
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,210
federal law

571
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:15,230
and let me just say if we had had
computers when I was in high school

572
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:19,630
I'd still be in prison well and that's
really true

573
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:23,340
yeah I start picking locks when I was 15
and figure out how to make many phone

574
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,100
calls

575
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,080
and teaching cops are used pennies in
the nickel slot on the payphone

576
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,319
and you know and and graduated from
there and i really am lucky I didn't get

577
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,240
into trouble

578
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,340
but you know I am NOT going into law
enforcement but

579
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,610
it's a really really good question in a
big problem is

580
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,780
and actually I what we're finding is
dead

581
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,950
%uh you know most black hat hackers

582
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:51,430
are bottom dwellers you know there is no
future

583
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:56,480
and net these there's really no future
in in staying in a dark closet somewhere

584
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,970
and doing is just because you can

585
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:02,500
so what we of rain is arm somehow

586
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,870
let mine you know when I'm them at

587
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,180
go here will actually arm as big

588
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,259
I've been brought up into the swirl dove
on

589
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,370
physical security and cyber security and
I've gotten myself into some pretty

590
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:18,830
sticky situations actually purpose going
to lock down a couple times

591
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:23,230
Obama yeah directory with all the
printers and propaganda

592
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:27,480
arm anyways I I think it comes with
knowledge

593
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,580
and I think me being redirected by my
dad made as a

594
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,980
the hardware security experience
actually was did come

595
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,320
telecommunications in now on the Marine
Corps

596
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,020
and I'll it had my dad directing me from

597
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,740
okay you did this this is good let's see
how we can fix it so this doesn't happen

598
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,800
again

599
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,770
and somebody else doesn't do this and
that really really sparked my interest

600
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,250
in this whole security world

601
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,620
and so adjusted I'm sorry only thing
that was just a peres

602
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:00,470
I use my concerns which your dad I mean
we all have these people realize it's

603
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,300
what with so you put on lockdown what
was the administrators reaction and how

604
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,120
do you

605
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,810
how do we as as a group of people are
trying to make this model work

606
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:14,900
Educati people who encounter these kids
and how to redirect them

607
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,540
to you guys as opposed to yelling

608
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:23,509
world just like just like a kid mumia
just like your little kid who spills

609
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:26,650
water on his brother and his parents
yell at him he's striving for the

610
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,410
attention

611
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:31,009
is the same way that I believe that me
and a lot of other

612
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:34,670
kids who started becoming Black Cats if
you wanna call it that

613
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,230
they strive for the tension all the
principal said I did something bad they

614
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,530
don't know what I'm doing

615
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:42,700
I can do it again I'm he has to turn
from that

616
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:47,210
into okay you did this this is bad I
don't happen again you're smart enough

617
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,690
to do it

618
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:52,200
can you help me make it to somebody else
can't do it and the infinite for doing

619
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,300
that the right way

620
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,070
here that has to be a carried out their
hours astonished to learn

621
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:02,550
couple weeks ago that some other
consultants in this deal who come in and

622
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,760
teach

623
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,460
about cybersecurity and they're the best
to the best

624
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,570
charge five thousand dollars and a well

625
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:15,370
that the big incentive to do it the
right way

626
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:18,430
it's a big if they need to know that you
have a job when you get out

627
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:22,279
legitimate you always have a job is not
a big in them

628
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,740
to know that you could possibly go to
prison because you doing this just

629
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,390
because you can

630
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,810
next question I so I am

631
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:34,779
from 1000 University wows on on on on
this now but at the time I was going

632
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,430
through their

633
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:39,230
subsidy program and so one other things
that

634
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:43,510
we would find particularly within our
security team and we will go out and do

635
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,800
these competitions DC

636
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,160
3ccd see you name it 'em

637
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,299
was at the beginning of the year we send
our email on Start then we'll have you

638
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,280
know a packed auditorium the people are
interested me because they saw

639
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,109
hackers when they were growing up for
you know sort fishing stuff like that

640
00:38:59,109 --> 00:39:01,370
and there's a lot of hollywood as stuff
not really the

641
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:05,250
you know hands on the keyboard stuff
what we found is that after three weeks

642
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,340
there's a high drop off rate love

643
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:11,760
okay what's actually no white the fewer
than balls and the work they have to put

644
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,670
into it

645
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:17,710
you know the kinda tend to lose interest
that was the case in a problem we had

646
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,170
for several years what

647
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,500
we've kinda done to alleviate that

648
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,750
is we make it a bit more immersive
colloquy trying two years on and off you

649
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:30,870
implemented something similar where what
we do is we'll have the general talks

650
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,130
on you know what other future
possibilities you can do you can go into

651
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,820
different security roles

652
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,580
weathers private sector public sector
what we have and do as we do

653
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,660
sessions where they're small group
sessions so it's more one more time

654
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,629
between the whoever's

655
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:48,980
I guess tutoring ish to the people but
we do is we do a comprehensive big

656
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,990
a exam you know it's not it's nothing
like

657
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,090
to long you know it takes about a half
hour of

658
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,590
where your strengths are where your
weaknesses lie not just on a technical

659
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:03,270
standpoint but on a conceptual level and
on an abstract thought level

660
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:06,859
odd to see if you can can get you in the
mindset of solving

661
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:11,720
you know problems any notes a because
what we found is that

662
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,120
by engaging them in a shorter group

663
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:19,359
I and buy a giving them and kinda been a
valuation first we can better direct how

664
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,759
we put them in our program in who we can

665
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,070
nobody them up with an partner
themselves on a maybe if you guys have

666
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,510
bought a

667
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:29,260
implementing that you know we have let's
take the physical security side cuz

668
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:29,740
thats

669
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:35,000
that's my real expertise I what are the
areas that I called would be the apollo

670
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,960
thirteen room

671
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,130
okay if we give you

672
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,350
let's say we give you are buffet

673
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:47,700
have 10 different its physical security
problems to solve involving

674
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,440
real products roblox real doors

675
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,950
real server rooms whatever and we tell
you

676
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:58,980
these are the tools were gonna give you
you figure out what to do with them

677
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,550
you figure out the solution to get
through the door

678
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:07,180
okay and then we want an analysis are
how this lockers design

679
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,899
for this mechanism that's just dumb
what's wrong with that

680
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,930
how do you defeated how do you fix it
and let's say we have 10 kids in the

681
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,509
squad to do that

682
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:20,109
for a day two days whatever and then
their report and everybody's got the

683
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:21,690
similar problems to solve

684
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:25,520
and they choose what problems they saw
but say they're magnetics based

685
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,800
the say they're physics-based I Newton's
third law of motion based whatever

686
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,100
so were constantly challenging you and
that's one of the models were looking at

687
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:39,190
so you really really get into this to
come up with a solution

688
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:43,640
when I really believe from dealing with
a lot of kids

689
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,850
if you take really bright kids and you
put them together

690
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:50,370
and you give them a problem the solvent

691
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:54,819
if there's a solution the solvent and
I'll spend 24 hours to do it

692
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,990
you know forget forget the venue

693
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:01,520
you know ever by said said what occurs
we have an offer from the state of

694
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,359
Florida

695
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:07,140
why don't you come to Orlando you know
where disney world is in

696
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:12,620
Universal Studios who cares the kids are
going to these kinda venues

697
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:17,100
for vacation they're going to really
really be intriguing how their minds

698
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,260
challenge and that's what we think this
is all about

699
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,390
them any more questions

700
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:27,390
please yeah a.m.

701
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,940
I grew up poor Anna I started hacking

702
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,070
beginning mostly cuz i kinda for long
distance phone calls

703
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:37,609
yes sir I so your home but

704
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:40,970
the reason the time pointing that out is
all the

705
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:44,080
intensive things I've managed to go to
throughout my life

706
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,540
were all scholarship based or Fri I
couldn't afford Space Camp

707
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,290
even know my uncle worked for nasa and I
rode 1.1

708
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,640
be in Natrona um so

709
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,440
I do think the intensive programs are
very valuable but I i just want to

710
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,370
encourage you someone who's also

711
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:04,350
II supper program now for robotics
temporary education for kids

712
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:07,750
I'm just a to try to reach out to the
poor kids

713
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,590
and the ones who can afford it and and
even

714
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:15,470
maybe have a grassroots program at at
bike is at the high school level

715
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,670
involving teachers and then maybe make
your thing like the national

716
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,030
championships

717
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:24,080
so that way more more grassroots more
rapport

718
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,020
poor basis can can get involved because

719
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,859
you know is essentially if you're
talking about space and

720
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,850
and maybe things will change I don't
know I and looked into it since I was a

721
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:35,330
kid and

722
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:39,250
wanna do it but there was there was
nothing in between there is space him

723
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:43,010
or there was yeah looking at posters and
sold

724
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:46,420
you know arm as someone who did grow up
poor

725
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,770
I just incurred you like you know

726
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:53,750
all the things that I did that got me in
trouble props like you

727
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,020
I did because pretty much you can afford
it you know

728
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,400
my dad was blue-collar my mom to care
the family in

729
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,600
so I just encourage you that when you're
looking a program

730
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,550
a lot of us to may have maybe Black Cats

731
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:11,380
you know our lotto that are doing it not
necessarily just because you care for

732
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,260
them of what military

733
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,430
you know and and the military's usually
way to get out there

734
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:20,830
you know and and curr kids your pride
doing things

735
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:24,240
sometimes are feeding their families you
know said I just want you to keep in

736
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,070
mind that

737
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:28,200
all in people were blackout sometimes do
for a reason

738
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,990
and well not only are we covering that
the model lia's

739
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:38,280
to have some scholarships not only for
kids who can't afford to calm

740
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,250
but for some disabled routes were
comfort for security

741
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,720
absolutely perfect and because

742
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,090
frankly arms and legs don't matter when
you're doing security work

743
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:56,090
it's what you're here and you know we're
looking at you know obviously wealthy

744
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:57,470
parents are gonna for those

745
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:00,550
but they can subsidize the kids who can
afford

746
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:03,800
it's already in the mix we're already
extensive we talked about this

747
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,150
and as far as base camp is concerned
neva that was always

748
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:13,750
top man with us on because we want every
kid to be able to come and what we ended

749
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,970
up doing we had a big scholarship
problem that was coping

750
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:20,350
they funded up but he was not freeze

751
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:24,100
you couldn't come breeds you had to have
an investment in it

752
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,480
if you had to wash cars for the summer
and

753
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,569
and pay for fourth and your tuition

754
00:45:30,569 --> 00:45:34,300
then that because if you have an
investment in something it means more to

755
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:34,880
you

756
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,339
but we did have a big scalps yeah as a
matter of fact I think Chelsea's clinton

757
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:39,500
was on scholars

758
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,750
does your dad couldn't afford to send I

759
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:47,750
next question by the way my my my
original handle on the internet 1995 was

760
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,640
more time Fri

761
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,520
soul that tells you anything course I'm
officially sold I love the idea

762
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,940
Hommerson things fantastic castrate

763
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,050
so now you do your call radius we may be
folks that call a little bit perhaps you

764
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,330
not coming as an honor

765
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:06,680
shutting my second business what's good
what's gonna take the recital is now

766
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,160
process eight years in development
likewise in construction starting

767
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,779
now what it was in order asking you may
be blocked yeah it's really simple

768
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,750
I because we're with a critical lack of
funding lack of interest

769
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,450
when we'd when I talk to my buddy who
was head of security at 10 the National

770
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:24,470
Labs he proposes in 2006

771
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:29,470
with deal we and %eh ass and she said
they both said it was a stupid idea

772
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:33,120
which is you look to me so that means
it's a good idea but that was before its

773
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:33,500
term

774
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,710
that was before its time so we really
started putting this together in heaven

775
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:39,510
means in 2010

776
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:42,930
and now we have an agreement with the
man who you know with a major computer

777
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:45,390
University and we're moving here

778
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:49,120
if you got haters you know you got
something good there they are absolutely

779
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,330
sure what what's stopping us we've got
great friends like the dome the race

780
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,569
we're working on it we're working on
finding now

781
00:46:54,569 --> 00:46:58,270
funding that's and we are landing on you
know yet they're funny so now

782
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:02,500
we've had major meetings and our meeting
with corporate sponsors

783
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,089
and some government folks and so now
we're gonna put it together

784
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:09,109
well actually we just chose the venue
last month yeah

785
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:12,290
and we had that we have you know the
governor

786
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:16,210
the governor's office all the way to the
president the University them

787
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:20,760
%uh border region up you know the
universe everybody is involved

788
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,790
everybody's embalmed now we could not do
anything

789
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,650
into we had a venue next question
because we're gonna run out time here

790
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:31,319
thank you

791
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:34,680
hi I've done and security related
training

792
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:39,520
members kind for about five years and
I'm curious as to whether

793
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,780
you are looking at as per this project

794
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:46,480
finding a way to export some this really
verified knowledge you're trying to

795
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:46,940
cultivate

796
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,200
in a select group out to everyone else

797
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,390
because it seems to me that

798
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:56,440
nice princes and then in the news very
often

799
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,390
the problem is not that we don't have
you are really a leak or security

800
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,129
professionals but rather that

801
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,600
everyone increasingly is in a position
to influence

802
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,280
our overall security infrastructure then
there can be a weak link somewhere like

803
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,020
some employees who have instigated

804
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:15,230
a laptop home happens to be an inhabited
the ruins everything even in a moment

805
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:16,980
where they are really good security
practices

806
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:21,490
distance learning its gonna be it's
already built into the program

807
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:24,740
at the SU and we would obviously made

808
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:30,150
make it available at lat probably last
question is around time here

809
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:33,900
be more questions actually Minister
identify made

810
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,240
a graduate student in the sever security
program at NYU Poly

811
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,690
and and I actually just recently
attended the US cccam

812
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:43,810
that was held last week in June at
Virginia Tech Mike

813
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:48,029
comment actually is more towards you
know the demographics in room here as

814
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:48,870
well as

815
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:52,540
at your cccam I was the only woman in
attendance

816
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,759
I the thing that I find interesting

817
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,330
is bad too we're doing this based on
high school and college

818
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:04,480
and when im when I'm finding is that
young girls

819
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,630
South select long before they get high
school

820
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:11,260
and so what's the incubator process to
actually start

821
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:17,290
I am at the educational I elementary
level to actually start thinking that

822
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:20,319
that this is really cool and I just give
me an example

823
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,430
when my work colleagues has a 5-year-old
daughter just enrolled her in robotics

824
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:25,359
camp for the summer

825
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:29,640
she showed up very robotics camp she was
the only young lady that was there

826
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,080
so I mean work we're talking about
making this

827
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,940
ok but progress by were kind of not
doing anything

828
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:41,310
to seduce fifty percent of the
population that is a great britain on

829
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,720
your knees generation us an email so we
can talk

830
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,600
now will on that one one follow-up with
that we found in

831
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:52,339
in science that young girl self-selected
by the fifth grade

832
00:49:52,339 --> 00:49:55,370
and if they got turned off the fourth
and fifth grade

833
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:59,400
you didn't get them back any any any
last comments

834
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,370
before they throw cider yessir good

835
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:07,480
here starting your

836
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,540
new right yeah I know absolutely agree
up

837
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:16,330
right Righton your space

838
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:22,299
%um maybe but now i dnt need a skill set

839
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,680
you need a basic skill set before you
can even move forward that's when the

840
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,529
education comes in

841
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:31,160
yeah will it be treat this as a catalyst
and you go and

842
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,399
in you bring into the future I think
more

843
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,290
more younger kids will then teach even
younger kids

844
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:42,190
and then it'll start that way become
actual movement and I hope this is what

845
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,620
this is and start producing

846
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:48,180
but it starts small would really like to
thank you guys for your employer

847
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:51,950
and like I said mw2 bias at security dot
work

848
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:55,960
ob please get ahold of us cause we're
really really looking for your employer

849
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,870
at this level thank you very much it's
been a pleasure
