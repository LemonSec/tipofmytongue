1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,409
i think is rewire hacking the auditory
experience

2
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:10,409
with a million martek

3
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,349
low all right you can I

4
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,090
so I'm a million Marzec in my project is
called

5
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,120
required I it's a helmet that takes in
sound from the environment

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,890
and translated into vibrations and
they're conducted

7
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,699
through the skull and interpreted as
sound by the inner ear

8
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:49,300
is based on my own experience with

9
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,070
losing hearing in one ear due to tumor
and

10
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:59,180
up wanting to begin an experiment in the
realm DIY medical technology

11
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:06,180
and I wanted to consider less invasive
methods for augmenting here

12
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:19,020
I'm so it became aware that experiencing
sound through bone conduction was

13
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,440
possible I at the time that I had
surgery

14
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,890
and when are the possible ways to fix

15
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,990
monophonic curing is to drill a screw
into your skull

16
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,429
and attach a receiver to its so that

17
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,110
sound waves are converted into
vibrations

18
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,200
in the skull here's a diagram

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,460
here I'm so the sound bypasses the outer
ear

20
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,119
and the Middle here and it goes right in
here and says cochlea

21
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,390
and and it stimulates the nerves there

22
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,530
so this is actually why yours

23
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,560
your voice sounds different to you then
when

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,590
you sure your cell phone recording and
that's because your skull

25
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,899
is a actually vibrating said the Sun

26
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:15,899
a slightly different to you so don't
like the cell

27
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,660
I didn't like the idea of you know I
love

28
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,730
up getting the the implant cuz you you
end up with

29
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,140
an open wound behind your ear that
already doesn't work

30
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,340
and and some people really like that but
I guess

31
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,570
Acer wanted to adjust to having one ear
and see what the experience is like

32
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:41,840
and so I guess there were a couple
things that happen one was a

33
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,690
my eyes started compensating for

34
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,590
the lack of surround sound so you have

35
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,290
you're unable to really pinpoint things
in space

36
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,160
because you need two years to do that
they serve like triangulate

37
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,620
and so

38
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,370
when I walk into a room it's like my
eyes just like take it in like

39
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,470
a millisecond answer dove remember where

40
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,190
all the items in the room are and so
then when I hear sound assertive

41
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,240
up migrants are maps it to whatever

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,520
whatever I saw and this is this works
like

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,520
most of the time you know and sometimes
it doesn't like I had a friend who was

44
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,489
you know I saw him up stairs you know
and

45
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:36,599
a a little while later I heard his voice
and I thought he was still upstairs so I

46
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,340
looked up

47
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,750
he was actually you know coming out
that's because I had remembered

48
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:48,750
where I last saw space so

49
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,329
another thing was the Eunos

50
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:57,310
the with the sound a I was experiencing
it through

51
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,700
the hearing the already had and also

52
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,870
a vibration in the environment so sir
paying attention to that morning was

53
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,659
like a

54
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:10,989
you know I could do that before I just
wasn't paying attention to it so

55
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:14,389
when there's like playing the piano and
I became aware that

56
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:18,728
the whole instrument felt completely
alive in my hands you know it's like

57
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:22,280
all the nodes worser like traveling up
my arm you know

58
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,389
and it was just a really rich
experiences cell

59
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:31,380
so they decide to %uh start messing
around with that

60
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,300
technology I am and to adapt

61
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,910
to adapt it into a helmet you know to
serve share that perception

62
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,940
people and also like as a tool to just
tested

63
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,650
you know on myself in see you know the

64
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:55,650
if that was useful so

65
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,069
us

66
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:02,719
alright so it's a it's a helmet the
leaves aware free to

67
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,979
run their environment and experience

68
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:09,308
a physical sensitivity to sound and it
has

69
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:14,209
up really small microphones that has
signal amplifiers in it

70
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:17,499
up vibration components and

71
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:21,039
in my next version as thing in putting
in like an effect sir it like a

72
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,259
you know pedal just see other change

73
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:29,860
you know like you know if there's a
delay like with that change your

74
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,629
perception

75
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:34,769
um and it'll just turn a head

76
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:38,839
you know because it's like adjustable
helmet and I'm gonna put on

77
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,489
dial so they are also able to sir

78
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:49,489
control what you're hearing so these are
some the pictures from the process

79
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:54,248
I am business-like yeah I'm in the
sketch like right after

80
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:57,389
I lost my hearing cuz I I became aware

81
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:02,929
flake I you know picking up a radio
waves in the air or something and i got

82
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:08,399
sir interested in all this but I had no
idea for making a home that night

83
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,259
sir to put it aside for like three years
until

84
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:15,519
recently when I just got out a buncha

85
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,749
a audio equipment I had in my house and

86
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:21,779
and I tested it with like

87
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:25,219
pair where these

88
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,769
like vibration head your phone's

89
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:32,449
your buds and they make these and they
sell them to people they tell them they

90
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:33,209
can like

91
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:36,399
listen to music underwater

92
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,449
and I'm still I don't know if you guys
do this

93
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,939
never needed to listen to music
underwater

94
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:46,519
I am but in any case

95
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,209
a you know so it worked and then I just
started

96
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,539
are buying smaller hardware like to see
what I can find

97
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,139
so I didn't have to like be tethered to
the wall and walk around

98
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:02,849
like wires and so put it into a hatch

99
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:08,050
assert my first impression and noms you
know that didn't really work because I

100
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,639
had was

101
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,399
it was too soft you know an I went on a
walk in my neighborhood like this that

102
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,709
the guys in my neighborhood are you
seeing doing weird stuff now

103
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:21,879
like I wash into RadioShack in a panic
all the time

104
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,899
like what's going on up for it you know
so this is a it was actually a buncha

105
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:27,800
stuff like I

106
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,050
in RadioShack an arm you know stuck
together so does

107
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,539
so this is also interesting because a.m.

108
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:40,419
people could just you know walk into
like a store in their town unlike make

109
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,258
this stuff you don't have to go through

110
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,110
a surgeons you don't have to go through
doctors you don't have to go to your

111
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,379
medical insurance

112
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:50,389
%uh you know so if there's a way to

113
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:53,429
to make this easier and smaller you know
then

114
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:56,839
for things that are an invasive
obviously on

115
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:01,610
it it possibly help other people 'em

116
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,360
so the other home it to have more
structure and

117
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,610
and this is what my house looks like sh
is what my house usually looks like

118
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,809
and you know

119
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:17,639
so those just putting it together like
taking apart

120
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,229
an amplifier and you know

121
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:26,199
really blowing everything together and
testing it on my head in the middle of

122
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,890
the night

123
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,460
you know and then it was done so I was
gonna show it

124
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,479
the sound research summit at IBM but

125
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,289
142 your books cuz I really thought
people would

126
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:44,350
one where you know Uddin years that many

127
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,760
but I am I have a video from

128
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,000
that see

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,190
its

130
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,050
because a I wanted to have some folks
where

131
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,209
Lake give me feedback what it felt like

132
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:09,210
so much

133
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:21,390
from the beginning is just me talking in
seen enough

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I know what we need sound

135
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,710
here

136
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:50,710
and now we need video on

137
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,790
to get a sense of how it was

138
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,790
being perceived how it fits into the
overall ecology

139
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:21,790
are like what car like everything I

140
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,880
in

141
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,090
in

142
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,490
said hearing school vibrational

143
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:43,490
in

144
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,800
in suddenly something

145
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,690
in

146
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,760
some here

147
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,390
this

148
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,870
yes fat

149
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,220
Aug

150
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,120
realize that affect Mike

151
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,820
so people were experiencing at

152
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:24,200
action

153
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,500
as my ears are plugged in

154
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,350
chain

155
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,370
but yes

156
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:40,840
spin like retracted

157
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,630
track

158
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,310
Pfizer sensation

159
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:51,370
suffered lines try

160
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:58,370
like tired

161

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,639
sold any spin

170
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,650
here like Greece supplier

171
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:43,699
interest with the first basically

172
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,460
building

173
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:54,260
details

174
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:01,260
in

175
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:11,290
in

176
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,490
alright

177
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,100
so I am I'm going to be running

178
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,440
a demo this for a week in October so I
don't have it with me today I am getting

179
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,150
it ready

180
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,959
and gonna be doing it outside a

181
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,430
the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary on
14th Street

182
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,980
as for the art not places for civil

183
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,670
and um I'm like kinda scared because I
had

184
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,520
all these doctors there sigh I kinda
wanna run into one

185
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:48,010
and with a and childlike sell it back to
them

186
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,800
we'll see what happens so aren't so
that's all I have her right now I'm

187
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,910
I don't you guys had questions others
interested in Lake

188
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:02,759
if you know how you guys feel about that
or if you know anyone who's had

189
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,369
you know like a likes similar experience

190
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:08,549
the sermons in relief set up for this

191
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:15,549
so they said you could like walk up here

192
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,680
see you 10 efforts guy is going through
these your buds

193
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,350
so I just syrup plant them on on my
forehead

194
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,150
and and it vibrates enough it's actually
a really strong one

195
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:41,689
that I was 30 packing it has its own
amplifier on it so

196
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:47,600
us a stronger than actually normal
damage

197
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,690
if there's damage to the energy today
fibers inside

198
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,220
in here with this to work or is this
reliant on the fibers

199
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,940
transmits yep that's the word

200
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,480
a so you you need to have

201
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,580
the inner ear and unita the auditory
nerve from your brain

202
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,980
at least one it'll work if there's one
in place

203
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:16,980
have you considered non

204
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,480
oratory impact like ranging from

205
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,320
ultrasound or are different types a
sense is that could be mapped into

206
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,210
an auditory sick up

207
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:34,360
them I make this totally different
project by a rhythm

208
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,150
exhibition last summer where they had
the sleek like a sonic

209
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,579
that you could get in the bed sir

210
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:46,509
and cell

211
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:47,100
yell

212
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,440
I'll see you what when I come across you
have any ideas for like

213
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,779
what you wanna experience I think

214
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:59,680
my wife actually is blind so was very
interested

215
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,000
haptic feedback for certain things and
so range

216
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,149
finder make interests you could

217
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:09,420
sensor room an amplifier hearing

218
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,850
against she relies very heavily period
you

219
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,850
which is so fast is tricks navigating
space

220
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:22,850
relationship outside shooters happen
hearings there's there's a few projects

221
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,329
that

222
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:31,370
abuse sensation like vibration or
electrodes and things like that treemap

223
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:31,949
sentence but

224
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,449
my question was am a lot of these
projects

225
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:39,810
and Joe what I guess as well is based on
losing

226
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,750
some kind of sense or to in some way

227
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,709
having something missing from what we
consider as

228
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:52,040
the normal human experience is this
something from your project

229
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,910
that's you think could apply to

230
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,600
make hearing better band the normal
human experience

231
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,800
like is there at it things that you can
do to improve your other year

232
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:08,800
as opposed to merely regain what you had
lost I don't think that

233
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,938
technology is really ready his

234
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,130
so it's all men on the thing about

235
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,189
that sounds it's a it's so beautiful in
one year

236
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:23,709
you know I'm wearing something that's
artificial even like these totally crazy

237
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,010
hearing is that people would a it's
still

238
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,450
it's like it is like listening through
Arabia

239
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,320
others interference his things a

240
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,320
it would be great her I was saying im

241
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,550
you know adding onto your sensor is

242
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,800
definitely you know more than art
project but what if I put like 10

243
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,540
microphones around my head

244
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:54,190
360 sound all the time

245
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:54,950
there's someone

246
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,600
in

247
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,440
win when you have this on dodd do you
have to spend extra time thinking about

248
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,389
what your

249
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:07,940
getting in order to interpret it or
because it's sorta plugging into the

250
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,019
internal security ring anyways is still
very intuitive

251
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:14,409
the you you hear it as hearing instead
of hearing it is

252
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:18,029
something new and different yeah

253
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:21,620
you get used to it a say so you know it
is

254
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:27,789
it is like your and

255
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:32,139
its and I think one other thing stay
players sir than most like that that the

256
00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:35,850
frustration you had misplaced
localization because he had like justice

257
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,309
the one you know that you could hear

258
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:41,658
his is there anything I can be heavy
have you tried anything with

259
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:44,690
with that the inputs for the sound and
how many

260
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,639
passively even sending something to tit

261
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:51,690
to fully functioning here as well to
taxi

262
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,159
recreate that perception like the
location

263
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:02,269
sound sources make me maybe relative
strengths coming into and I know exactly

264
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:03,379
how you do it

265
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:06,690
other that stole it police you

266
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,049
cuz it sounds slightly different you
kinda

267
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,299
realize that it's on you know whatever
side here

268
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:17,210
microphones see concert up train
yourself

269
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,690
to to find direction way

270
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,269
a sign O The

271
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:29,129
usual upper limit on highest frequency
people can years actually due to the

272
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:29,879
structural

273
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:32,909
outer year and through bone conduction
hearing you direct

274
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:36,159
many tens still hurts least gonna do
anything alters

275
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:41,299
with this for your help sound Wales

276
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:47,908
here a good question

277
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:52,129
could translate that people

278
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:55,679
underwater

279
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,960
her that scary

280
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,779
this is a great talk do you have a sense
if what this will be

281
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:09,490
in three years five years time do you
see this morning's

282
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,059
art medical technology product

283
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:16,129
just like to hear can with what's your
vision for a few years

284
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:20,750
that's a really good question because I
just started this

285
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:26,200
this year you know sigh I am interested
in

286
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,240
if it's possible to make it smaller 'em

287
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,970
sure it is so that's something I have to
look into

288
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,730
up but I think it would just be called
have

289
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:41,450
you know some sir kidder's some service
structions

290
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,750
because it it's a nice feeling to

291
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,409
that people could just make it you know
and have anything

292
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:53,760
there's actually a a lab this little
devices love it MIT

293
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,520
were there they're doing this and that
they're like totally serious like bill

294
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,899
go to Africa and people on pharmacy so
they'll be like

295
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:06,710
oh how do we make a pregnancy test was
taken apart and see how it's made

296
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,720
you know see if there's materials in the
environment his

297
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,710
for that kind of stuff so sir

298
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,090
yeah and that's the worst case scenario
thing

299
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:25,090
I like worst-case the search ago in the
UK

300
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:30,500
you might be interested in talking to
Google Docs Kevin Warwick

301
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,220
mayor to babies kinda robotics guys
medical doctor

302
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,899
an but I went to a lecture is

303
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:41,159
my twelve months ago he's doing similar
things

304
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,559
ticket with them ultrasonics some
someone mentioned earlier I am

305
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:48,730
Eaton Centre Connor just serve

306
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,730
augmenting extra senses socialist

307
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,980
work he's doing is sorta fam implants

308
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,120
light but a lot of its external
conducted vibrations

309
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,149
similar to this so but with looking ako

310
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:09,429
there in yes

311
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:15,299
hello

312
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:20,450
I think you're totally cool idea and a
is it necessary for your entire head to

313
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,419
be encapsulated could you have like a
super cool futuristic headband sort of

314
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:25,159
thing that just goes

315
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:30,779
all the way around but does it have to
be in a helmet yet doesn't have to be a

316
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:31,380
home

317
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,539
%uh you know that was just sorta

318
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:40,100
you know a test to to just get the thing
working and be able to have this

319
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,940
wireless thing that I could go outside
where deseo

320
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,909
fell I am so yeah I mean would you wear

321
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,240
features a kilt had been second wearable
clothes

322
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,490
I mean you know

323
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,090
augmented reality people are putting in
OLED screens in glasses will

324
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,449
why not augment your hearing to it'll be
a totally cool idea and

325
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:09,399
I would buy it if it's a really good
knife

326
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:14,429
I'm wondering how often do you wear this

327
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:19,880
and outsiders like the the proof of
concept like houses change like everyday

328
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,020
interactions

329
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,918
people unlike the social side your door

330
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,610
where this normally its the definitely
is test project

331
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,370
and certain where 1 you know it's

332
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,940
it feels like performance or Sunday

333
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,039
demonstrations yet it has a really
performative

334
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,580
aspect to it because %uh I'd

335
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,389
I really don't need to beware big helmet

336
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:56,950
her my daily life I mean maybe I should
go to work

337
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:01,960
actually when it when I had surgery a
singing about this a

338
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,620
arm I wasn't supposed to get hit on the
head cuz

339
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,730
like a homeless couple had to it takes
like six weeks to heal up so

340
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,710
a single is like a really good post
surgery sir

341
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,049
project words like you know you've just
come out

342
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:22,720
and you're like pocket I can't hear in
one year a must first get hit on the

343
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,370
head

344
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:27,530
you know II don't know of any go for

345
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:34,530
I'm the kinda person airs on the side of
caution

346
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,750
and I've heard many horror stories about
people losing hearing to you know

347
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:42,919
listings too many rock concerts in like
and my spouse actually had close to 80

348
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:43,700
minutes missing

349
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,190
most this hearing in one ear and I'd be
concerned about using something like

350
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,379
that because

351
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:52,600
what are the implications for his
working here John

352
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,389
would it cause any sort a damaged at
amplified sound vibrating to his entire

353
00:24:56,389 --> 00:24:59,539
skull

354
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,820
%uh I don't know cuz it you know

355
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,639
goes right

356
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:14,640
young survivors the bones process years

357
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,379
you know be interesting actually to see
like you know the stuff that's on the

358
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,200
market like the ones where they like

359
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,760
implanted in your head you know if
there's a serve long-term

360
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,970
damage kisses anything different and so
they're already selling

361
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:48,970
you noses articles question you mention
that it has microphone

362
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,750
at least one to I'm microphones are

363
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,030
very affected by what's around them ur

364
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,330
how they're placed so I wanted to
experiment at all brings

365
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:07,560
like a parabolic Mike if you could you
could carry it with you or you could

366
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,740
point in different directions

367
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,800
or you could even since it could be
Wireless you can leave the mic somewhere

368
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,390
else

369
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:18,010
you know like dropping your stage or
something or you were talking about

370
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,450
things to hear you could

371
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,910
heartbeat sensor made hear their
heartbeat perhaps

372
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:27,490
she called me up

373
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:34,490
to work on this here my head

374
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,770
are I had one idea I'll from the two
things that we're talking about here

375
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:48,000
arm if you can hear higher frequencies

376
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,550
through like bone conduction on maybe
you can like

377
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,620
make in ultrasound

378
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,770
thing that with me hope tech guys wife

379
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:03,170
see by like a bear through also sell

380
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,670
conducting so there's a project for
something you think

381
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:13,670
X yeah there can I have this whole thing
in Central Park

382
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:20,220
hanging out with bats next week

383
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:26,560
toilet piss up

384
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:33,080
ultrasonic thing coming up I think if
someone's there some

385
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,620
Center that Central Park

386
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:43,470
arm

387
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,990
salonga SSAS a ISBN much from you so why
a study for a bit

388
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,180
of Chicago sticks arm usually get that
the stereo

389
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:56,030
that to bring receives how to your local
ice

390
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:00,220
a where the sons Khamis I learned I
don't bite but the brakes are you

391
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,730
us as you have learned that you get the
sounds from there

392
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,580
last place you have seen something legal
Q look it's

393
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,679
I still on done now with when the chance
comes

394
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,010
so maybe I if you only hot

395
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,370
if you only got South the school

396
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,390
yes I'm for one year

397
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:24,070
and you leave the usual your fine your
II

398
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,919
on uncover may be few did for a while
you began to

399
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,420
to get some kind of a stadium inmates on
your brain and began to learn how to

400
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,160
hope to have it up this regain not be
tough your

401
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,450
okay some beauties basam based on that

402
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:46,430
stand seeing not on scene but air

403
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,640
still having you your you healthy

404
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,200
yaron uncover I'm and getting there and
Adia are there are

405
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,070
like placing them on Mike on the other
side and getting the info from

406
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,270
fun day at the other side on unjust
column two bombs

407
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:06,150
yeah absolutely because it will sound
like slightly different

408
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:13,150
coming from a device maybe it's a
process of learning from anyone up for a

409
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:19,020
while maybe you have it like for one
week or two your brain begins to

410
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,260
to do something and and relate into two
different kinds of sound and you can

411
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:23,800
relate

412
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Maryland done with site like you do now
yeah I mean

413
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,980
I think that's really good idea pick one
thought about that would be a trend and

414
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,720
still have the transducer appear

415
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,650
try to localize little bit closer to the
I guess to the bad here so I guess

416
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:45,540
you know the good years still hearing
out you know sound from the outside in

417
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,710
having a transducer over here just
because I know that those Q's

418
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:52,650
are usually timing and level based news
so

419
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,110
if you really want to try and tackle
Apia trying

420
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,120
localize with this you try and I guess
first

421
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,480
get the transition to be like equally
roughly equally as loud as the good here

422
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,310
and then um and the time difference
should just work

423
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:11,520
because if the transducers over here
it's as if it's

424
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,200
you know for years so having if you want
to try and pursue that render

425
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,910
school the transducer over to where
there was

426
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:25,930
you're absolutely right

427
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,400
have you thought about modifying it for
like entertainment purposes surfer this

428
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,620
was markets

429
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,320
just throwing people like have more

430
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,560
different auditory experience is

431
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,360
was thinking about that one you know I
was

432
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,850
building an effects pedal it's not in
there yet

433
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:52,020
you know like it it's a nice experiment
to see you know if you have a delay

434
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,420
you know other changes your perception
you know if you added

435
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,420
a larger delay in Sherwood really change
so

436
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,570
that's a matter just taking

437
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:06,550
you know some with normal hearing messy

438
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:10,240
so so it's not

439
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,280
it could be fun you know

440
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,770
here yeah that's you

441
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:23,770
for education

442
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,950
I understand that this is primarily

443
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:37,000
device for you too gain back some your
ability and

444
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,960
like like we said earlier arm I
completely understand that I've been in

445
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,500
that position

446
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,250
at five surgeries are right here apart
my skull removed I have a hole in my ear

447
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:45,700
drum

448
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,410
I have difficulty hearing a lot of
frequencies and

449
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,410
if half the people this rumor talking
right now

450
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,950
I'll be going insane because I wouldn't
be able to handle it on

451
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:59,300
I think this kinda devices wonderful for

452
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,560
for dealing with that but could also be
used for expanding

453
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,250
beyond what our current senses can
currently handle

454
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:11,100
light warranty I just how was a pH
sensor for example

455
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,010
you could here the city of

456
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:19,140
such the air around you you could here
the moisture level in the air

457
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:24,120
I think that be a great way of expanding
upon our

458
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,360
basic senses and allowing us to
experience the world

459
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,500
and burn from the world in new ways
kinda scary

460
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,430
hit yes yeah okay

461
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:44,430
%uh

462
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:54,090
create socket get some great ideas I was
wondering if you ever heard a

463
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:58,250
in Rochester and at Rochester Institute
of Technology they also have

464
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:02,250
the National Technical Institute for the
Deaf and I think they would love to hear

465
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:02,730
your idea

466
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:07,259
Friday if a look them up

467
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:10,480
hood 3 thanks

468
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,090
I am ok is that it

469
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,250
her I guess thanks for coming at us
