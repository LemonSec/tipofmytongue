1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,280
its literally load the kernel image I

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,970
in your web browser and was it pretty
quickly there's a gameboy emulator

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,389
very recently there's a BitTorrent
client that does all the

4
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:14,268
fancy cycling things that but or does
and all in your browser

5
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:17,699
which I found really fascinating and
this was all done

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,470
in javascript so my

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,549
wonderful idea was agreed to Google Docs

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,490
or not critical will talk why not
because you could have i mean why not

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,500
a investigate the area I love

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,450
encrypting things in the browser so that
all the services that everyone is using

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,520
for all their data

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,860
can be included by default in the sense
that the user would not even be aware

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,149
but that was happening because they
didn't need to be and there was a

14
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,050
issue also that well you can argue that

15
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,379
Google and Facebook never do this
because Facebook the Pens on

16
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,899
your data to make money and that's a
very valid argument but there are couple

17
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,469
services out there such as Google

18
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:01,370
docks and will doesn't depend on the
context of your paper presentation but

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,250
more in volume

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,319
up our position that hasn't so a

21
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,119
if you're acquitted that actually might
be okay with them because also saves

22
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,150
them the legal over

23
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:15,650
and so it's possible to have for me it
appeared at the time that was possible

24
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,229
to have

25
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,810
our clients I decryption for those easy
accessible services

26
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,180
why not let's do it what a great idea
right I was so excited

27
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,619
I tend to get excited so that was

28
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:31,430
%uh more than a year ago and at the time
we had some rudimentary client-side

29
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,110
crypto

30
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,770
for browsers in javascript and

31
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,780
willfully liking in terms of

32
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,229
Quality Inn necessarily on terms of the

33
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:46,210
numbers cuz we had a lot of those things
we still do that was a

34
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,380
your there was a year ago more than a
year ago your two months ago

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,589
and to top it off this was a new
experimental field

36
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,579
there in a browser kline said brother
crypto was in this exactly

37
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,950
are something that everyone was wearing
about people or more busy worrying

38
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,110
about supp s which is a

39
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,799
and to encryption that does not actually
crib the information that you're storing

40
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,289
on the server only crib set

41
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:11,480
as it arrives to the service go through
the white

42
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,060
or through the internet and so everyone
hated this field

43
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,870
because the problems and were two
numbers are discussing his palms today

44
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,690
but what the heck

45
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,950
I A like cuts cuts are great and so

46
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,020
I created a father called crypto ca

47
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,580
to combine my love for photography and
cats

48
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,080
it was a pure vision love for childhood
innocence

49
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,269
hellish and

50
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:41,650
I had story looks in my eyes as I stared
up on the horizon about that one day my

51
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,590
project would be something great that
everyone would love

52
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:50,330
soak up the cat was my experiment it was
to create sex

53
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,239
accessible you know otra trees you had
to use the TR okay

54
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,920
keep your hand raised your journalist
who's used RTR well

55
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,040
two hands okay um

56
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,679
so the point here is that you know we're
all hackers

57
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,430
great we all like to use it. are all
very smart with a crypto an hour

58
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,269
other dates back and so that those are
obviously a very important things

59
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:14,560
extremely important things but

60
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,220
the I come from so let me tell you

61
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,129
a story a a miserable story about how or
when I try to go to the Middle Eastern

62
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:26,489
tell people how to use it. I did and it
worked fine today all you had to use a

63
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:26,970
Dr

64
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,269
and they did not not because I suck

65
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:35,920
as a teacher but because otro is not
accessible

66
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,299
it's not a pleasure to use you have to
download pidgin installed yours a plugin

67
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:42,090
configure it for five fingerprints make
sure that the other party and that's the

68
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,730
biggest thing make sure that the other
party does the exact same thing

69
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,269
and in many cases the other parties and
someone you've given in OT our chapter

70
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,470
so that starts that's not exactly

71
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,470
conducive to revolution where everyone
to communicate openly because

72
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,260
communicating

73
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,819
is basically like passing US border when
it comes to

74
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:06,799
being able to do it 'em someone else so
the point is was there to make it

75
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,390
accessible

76
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,959
and the browser just open you can send a
link to someone you have a chat room

77
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,670
integrated with and/or chart like

78
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,540
protocol and it works and its securing
its clients and corruption and works

79
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,579
exactly like virginity

80
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,978
and also and is very important

81
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:24,080
are realizing early on that this was an
experimental field

82
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,840
I thought the iPod could be a testbed to
test solutions and see what works

83
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,930
and produce up solutions that work for
other projects to and for the field in

84
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,169
general

85
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,340
but there were so many problems not only
the browser could talk if you totally

86
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,590
suck at the time

87
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,020
but this was be your reaction to what I
did

88
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:47,409
for the past year so thanks a lot for
that

89
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,770
from was a justified yes

90
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,849
multi-party Krypton messaging a in the
browser

91
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,490
with these primitives I must be crazy
and I might be I actually was at the

92
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,050
time

93
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,479
the it wasn't a feasible idea it was an
experiment

94
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,940
it was the product love and idealism of
what computers could be

95
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,930
which I believe is extremely important
but definitely not what computers where

96
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,120
the time

97
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,870
the problems finally Co delivery
delivering the code

98
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,880
from the website from the effort from
the web app

99
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,949
to your browser. up is it safe

100
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:24,979
to do that is the cold gonna get
modified on the way is gonna get

101
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,250
modified before it's sent

102
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,970
these are interesting whatever you know
yeah I would modify everyone's

103
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,180
JavaScript code

104
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,830
and you know send that to it's it's
totally possible that I would do that

105
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,099
from security perspective it's
reasonable to

106
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,740
have safeguards against me doing that
because the difference and I'll get to

107
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,690
them

108
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,280
and also a number generation so August
replies in the current time to drain a

109
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,139
random numbers cool story bro

110
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,449
a cryptographic primitives all speak
about that

111
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:54,800
browser sandboxing means basically that
every tab in the browser has to be a

112
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,009
different

113
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:59,350
Cebu thread basically a copying systems
work

114
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,259
and if it's not then the simple XSS in
one top can result in a complete crypto

115
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:05,539
compromise in the other

116
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:08,150
which is terrible and there were no
standards in the sense that there wasn't

117
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,460
exactly great library

118
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,669
if you discount the work at the time now
there's more than one good library but

119
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:14,448
at the time the only one was the
Stanford

120
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:18,460
crypto library which was by and we start
to believe it was pretty good

121
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,698
arm so

122
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:24,789
let's go deaf to these into these bombs
Co delivery

123
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:29,949
the non-member hush male yeah so this is
a great example actually because the

124
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:33,789
hush male offered include to the email

125
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:37,960
and it works in the browser and it was
supposedly private all interested as

126
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,419
that stored and also as it sent to other
harsh mail accounts

127
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:45,539
and what they did was an early form love
kline said crypto that use the Java

128
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,180
applet

129
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,400
which was really horrendous from a
efficiency point of view

130
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,490
but anyway arm and they

131
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,370
apparently did as they were did as they
claimed until they got

132
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,069
approached by the federal agencies and a
art at everyone

133
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:04,830
just like that and

134
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,090
this is a terrible a example to give

135
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,650
well its good example to give a about
the terrible this of

136
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,240
other problems with co delivery so when
you download tor

137
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,970
dollar to install it once and you're
done when the dollar pigeon you dollars

138
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,889
to one city W using a web after
downloading it from scratch

139
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:25,430
every time you open the website and so
when the dollar store

140
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,180
is only time for you know the code
poisoning to occur when you're

141
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,080
downloading and you verify the hash
whatever and then you're fine but

142
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,490
you have to verify every single time you
open crib to cat or whatever

143
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,110
any other occurred to Google Docs super
crypto Facebook gonna

144
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,139
whenever you a download 'em

145
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:46,090
whenever you open your secret to bidding
website you have to

146
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,379
for fight another problem

147
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:54,050
arm random number generation so math or
random use the current time preceding

148
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,280
and some does a trip to libraries
libraries at the time use dots for

149
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,340
randomness which made me a very eager to
test

150
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,240
the structural integrity of the nearest
wall using my hat

151
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,840
on but a perfect storm was brewing

152
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,599
and effort this from my perspective and
there was there were many technologies s

153
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:16,169
acknowledge them to crop up

154
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:19,889
to propelled this platform into
something

155
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:23,930
better at least better than and what it
was which mean was quite terrible so

156
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,590
we were able to solve a lot of problems
soap Co delivery

157
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,889
is HTTPS good enough to solve the
problem Co delivery no

158
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:33,969
because they should be s makes it so
what makes it harder for people to

159
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:35,469
poison the code as its

160
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:38,890
arriving to you but what if I do it I
mean I could easily

161
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,019
and an issue DBS would have no effect
whatsoever

162
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:45,250
there's also problems with certificate
authorities initially PS

163
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,660
so which means that random kid in Iran

164
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,949
was capable love literally getting

165
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,769
route see it like root certificates for
Pappy internet

166
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,450
cling google it was really scary thanks
the Komodo hack which happened I believe

167
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,180
a year and a half ago

168
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,339
but chrome Google Chrome

169
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:07,560
and I believe it which I believe is the
best browser in the world right now

170
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,510
a hat implemented local aP's recently
which meant that

171
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,569
adjuster and they believe they did this
for Chrome OS

172
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,190
which is just lies you can install an
app in your computer on your back on

173
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,610
your Windows or Linux machine

174
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,470
you can also download install an app
your browser work exactly the same way

175
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,990
it be sad boxed into its on CBS right
it'll be

176
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,180
load locally just as a and so your
browser handles ops 2 in offering system

177
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,160
handles ops

178
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,439
and obviously this ties into crime
wesson obvious ways

179
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,950
and soak up the cat became a crime map
and that solve the problem Co delivery

180
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,610
in my view completely because

181
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,490
it just worked the same as pigeon or
torrent him just as I said before and

182
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,260
that was very

183
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,310
the very feasible way to solve the
problem and not only did chrome

184
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,040
a actually just I mean be about as low
class are actually more than

185
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,949
what they seem to be especially with the
recent release of manifest version 2

186
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,570
which prohibits a certain false
statements and

187
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,140
inline javascript code makes it you know
really tightened security in ways they

188
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,959
find very creative and very effective

189
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,399
and I really have a lot of respect for
the security work to people to call

190
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,990
Crime

191
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,100
arm us so

192
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,519
yup so I think I already went ressa so
chrome

193
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,240
loads at Los the code securely its own
thread and we were subtly

194
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,170
making a regular IM client very closely
in terms of cod delivery

195
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,050
arm yeah math or random a so

196
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:37,579
forget about that we implemented um
bushfires

197
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:41,510
random number generator Fortuna which is
occurred to actually secure other number

198
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:41,980
generator

199
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,779
implemented in JavaScript and there's
library for that up there it's a

200
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,930
particularly difficult implementing
their

201
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,720
and so what happens is that you just use
that Anna

202
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,760
it has its own a complete discards math
at random and then a

203
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,480
will chrome went to implement that their
own random number generator was actually

204
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,079
gets

205
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:02,480
their its data from that random which is
pretty good

206
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,260
not too bad certainly a lot better

207
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,529
then math the random associating

208
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:12,649
the cryptography when a number
generators seeding means that

209
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:16,140
I mean and in computers was using
quantum computers are quantum state

210
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,199
us in hardware you don't have to
randomness and so you have to give it

211
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,550
something that's really random some some
ran we produced a tougher to use it to

212
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,329
produce ran into some call this the seed

213
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:29,970
as I'm sure a lot of you know this from
not an issue if using went to the crib

214
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,220
to dock at random since

215
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,380
it uses that random in itself seated and
that's no problem so chrome and safari

216
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,579
are done

217
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:39,040
and Firefox soon apparently hope so
Firefox thats

218
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,769
arm but for for tuna there's a whole
bunch of things that exist in the

219
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,260
browser that you can use for

220
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,420
seating a around a number generator to
do with inca

221
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,209
a keyboard input keypress depressed
timings as and the time between pressing

222
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:57,450
and depressing a key every key a mass
movement obviously viable state

223
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,470
and a window position and so on and so
forth

224
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,110
on mobile phones a we use the
accelerometer

225
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,170
which literally meant that in order for
your child to be secure you had to dance

226
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,479
with your phone in the most

227
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,029
unpredictable way possible so

228
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:20,029
I I think I did a good job at that
myself

229
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,500
I am so aside from that crypto
primitives

230
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,510
um we serve them with a cryptic
obviously I don't know why this is a

231
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,779
slight point

232
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:32,310
a ASET are and SNCR mode

233
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,620
Shah 512 and elliptic curve

234
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,279
diffie-hellman India said so obviously
since we do things and JavaScript to

235
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,290
doing things like

236
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,949
4096 but diffie-hellman is a pain in the
ass and especially be doing our sakes

237
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,320
had a jury to primes

238
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,089
but arm elliptic curve

239
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:52,220
crypto is actually smaller

240
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,269
a pastoral much like four times to up to
15 times faster way of generating keys

241
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:59,410
and a public keys in the browser

242
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,079
and its incredibly fast in the sense
that we can generate

243
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:06,329
fight all but keys which is very high a
number

244
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:09,730
Pittsford bill to curb in the browser
and I believe

245
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:14,089
less than three seconds so that's really
i mean it makes it so that

246
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:17,180
these complex script operations work

247
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,920
in the browser as if you're an and the
same speed and efficiency as if you're

248
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
working on at a stoplight

249
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,269
actually it's faster than ODOT are key
generation process even though that your

250
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:26,740
key generation process

251
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,750
and terms for sorry only in terms of the
public key generation process

252
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,790
not not not not the not the STTR because
that's another story

253
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,930
but the specifically the diffie-hellman
key generation process

254
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,370
hours even though it's safer is actually
faster and even though it's being done

255
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,630
in the browser

256
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,850
arm what about a protocol so

257
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,980
a we didn't handle this as well as a I
was as will be as well as we could have

258
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,500
our protocol would we all their own but
its specified and somewhat peer reviewed

259
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,079
by some

260
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,790
respected people arm but we still will
their own

261
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,569
and we could've we could have went with
implementing go to:

262
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,639
and that would have been helpful because
we have a naughty or labor in JavaScript

263
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,940
so that everyone else could implement

264
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,920
but the why we didn't do that because
I'll TR

265
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,279
was not that at the time however was
focusing on more features

266
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:19,370
so I wanted multi-party child I wanted
maturing file sharing and all those

267
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,399
things and private messaging interesa

268
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,949
and Jordan have that was your was just
composition within two people nothing

269
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:24,490
else

270
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,779
so that's why we implemented our own but
something very special is coming up

271
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:33,300
amputee are I'll be talking about that
its gonna be awesome

272
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,040
so a browser some boxing remains serious
issue but it's just a serious is it

273
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,480
as a it's just a serious an issue as

274
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,250
anything that a any when does

275
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,820
o'day that no gets you access to any

276
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,170
running process or Annie Mac o'day at
this level

277
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,420
it becomes it's never gonna not become a
serious issue and there's

278
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,480
arm evidence in Google us whatever
Google Offers

279
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,029
a bazillion dollars to have her can
break Google Chrome bolcom gets broken

280
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:02,820
in two minutes

281
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,050
is it because cool crime can be broken
in two minutes now it's because someone

282
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,720
shows up

283
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,360
and demonstrates how it's broken in two
minutes after having spent months on how

284
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,089
to break it

285
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:13,760
and that time when that happens able to
cross the fence and only recently

286
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,990
learned this when I was

287
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,529
yesterday actually here

288
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:22,730
the time when that happened was the only
time and apparently it's involved

289
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,089
chaining together seven

290
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,550
old days which something they have never
heard before in my life I don't know so

291
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:33,589
much but change 70 days

292
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:38,029
so whatever you accomplished we've
accomplished multi-party encrypt it shot

293
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:41,529
in the browser and on your phone's up

294
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:45,439
a homogeneous code base that's easily
deployable across servers

295
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,029
browsers and phones the same code base
which is

296
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:53,189
which speaks volumes in terms of
accessibility because as I said earlier

297
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,699
%uh accessibility and making sure people
in danger actually use your software

298
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,790
instead of glancing at it thinking it's
too hard or too inaccessible or the

299
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,120
other person won't know how to use it as
happens a lot with PGP for example

300
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,070
is an important facet secured occurred
to file sharing

301
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,470
picture files with each other you know
very Facebook style sort of

302
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,820
aunt yet we made accessing it a lot
easier so still experiment

303
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,110
very much experiment experiment I'll
with interesting and worthwhile outcomes

304
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,690
and you can check out the website at
project up to the cat is fully

305
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,029
functional by the way I'm not talking
about like a

306
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:28,079
half hop beats like suffered actually
works everything's there and as a spec

307
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,170
and development in

308
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,980
notes its actual project even though its
experiment

309
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,079
but this is not about crop to cup the
stock I

310
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,110
is about a lot more it's about the
future a browser Cup soccer field

311
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,850
as a legitimate platform which is
something to all of us should be focused

312
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,430
about

313
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,850
and all the should care about because I
believe it's very important and it's

314
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,300
very important

315
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,750
a it's not there yet but when we make it
there

316
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,860
the potential is immense and these are
problems that we can solve

317
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,100
and it completely disagree absolutely
with the notion

318
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,990
that there are broad that Gaza crypto is
not a problem that a solvable

319
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,299
that's bullshit weeks I mean really I
mean butter hikers assault their

320
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:07,480
problems for

321
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,599
just to put it simply there's no there's
no more romantic reason

322
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,449
and so I want you to imagine
standardized with crypto API I'm

323
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,939
this internalize across every single
Bazar I mean across every mobile browser

324
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,839
via desktop browser everything from
opera to Safari to

325
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,289
arm Firefox to chrome

326
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:29,820
to not to transport contracts for is not
a browser

327
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,740
a and it specified by the w3c which is
the same organization of course it

328
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,510
specifies

329
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:39,429
everything from HTML to assess the CSS
and that actually exists

330
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:42,440
I was gonna exist police earn but it's
currently working on its called love to

331
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,910
talk if you're working group

332
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:48,020
and it's something that the w3c has
initiated a stinks been like six months

333
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,789
now

334
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:51,799
and the suspect is gonna be released
everything can hear it happen cryptic as

335
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:52,710
part of that

336
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,240
project and the so this is what we're
working on this is what we want to do

337
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,080
we want to have an API to transparently
make it possible to encrypt

338
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,250
everything done

339
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,390
in the browser anything center went out
to for Freddie went up to

340
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:12,020
Inslee be able to provide the crypto API
did so transparent to users even have to

341
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,340
know it's there

342
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,039
you just use Google Docs and you do
whatever you want and you don't even

343
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,160
no cool does enough to tell you that
there's a crypto API going on

344
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,780
but it's there and that I believe is an
amazing foot in the door

345
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,970
for web privacy from a computer science
respective for achieving your privacy

346
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,289
from a practical mathematical
perspective

347
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:33,830
which is just as important as advocating
for a politically in and you know any

348
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,230
other

349
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,000
means min you think up

350
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,940
what's at stake is up

351
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,140
of course there's other collateral
security benefits up for being a

352
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,900
security

353
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,809
can really can't imagine if you right
now but I'm sure there

354
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:55,690
arm and get the transparent data privacy
potential can be

355
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,850
wrapped around the malleability and the
flexibility in the creativeness other

356
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,520
web platform

357
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,889
and this is something that more and more
people are trusting with it every day

358
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,700
and it's it's a very important field
therefore to focus on

359
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,200
thanks to implement inside this API
include block ciphers

360
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,660
public key systems hasher's and also
this is very important to have mentioned

361
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,910
this before

362
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:23,140
protected key space in browser so that
when you get a Nexus S is the weather up

363
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,660
you catch me the can't immediately be
used to disclose her private keep that

364
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,690
means that you have

365
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:33,330
buddy implement protected variables in
JavaScript that can only be accessed

366
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,860
in restricted way so that a your private
keys and treated us like the same

367
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,809
variable as your

368
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:42,139
window side sir any other just it's
given alarm or security

369
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,500
something that no browser house at the
moment which I believe would be very

370
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,070
useful in implementing

371
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,159
an API like this of course is Abia
believe has to be fully open SSL

372
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,059
compatible

373
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:54,149
as in the site for output ovett has to
be possible the open as assault because

374
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,350
I believe that we can use

375
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,740
sorta format as a standard for
interoperability with other

376
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,970
API's and crypto platforms

377
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,159
so quick to get to this one working on
right now its

378
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:09,419
a.m. the new got to cut to the sequel

379
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,110
to get to the drones trackback critic
yep are so

380
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,150
it's an XMPP client in the browser so
instead of using our own

381
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,890
chat whatever IRC sort of thing it's an
actual Jabber client and works exactly

382
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,970
the Jabber client works in the browser

383
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,630
serve using our own spec we're
implementing 0 TR and

384
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,909
NPR so

385
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:34,360
Mb 0 TR means multi-party otro and its
the future %uh bankrupted lecturing in

386
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,770
my opinion and I believe it should be
your opinion as well because what is

387
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,668
gonna do

388
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:43,059
is that it's going to make its possible
to have conversations with more than two

389
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:44,710
people at once

390
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,940
across across-the-board its gonna make
it is gonna group chats

391
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,240
in cryptid as can make them and and with
script with Chris got hopefully if

392
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,450
prosecutor becomes

393
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,710
a viable platform that we will be able
to offer group conversations

394
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,990
to people the other browsers be a wet up

395
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,049
and it'll be very easy for them to
actually access this new standard which

396
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:06,020
will not only

397
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,270
offer group chat the bill also offer a
cryptid file sharing which i believe i

398
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,830
mean why not 2001 on its really easy
actually have to go in at least 20 hours

399
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,100
right now just convert

400
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:21,429
the the the file to the base64 did a URL
in the senate as a message

401
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:25,020
I mean it's it's really done that's
that's it it's a 2-1 function

402
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,070
an a private messaging

403
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,830
you know why not also up week that we
can improve on the

404
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,189
primitives that OT are currently uses
which are I mean it's not to say that

405
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,659
they're completely dated but it's that

406
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,130
they could be improved upon a missed
shot one could you shop at 12 instead of

407
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,110
a 1536 but the reality is that the curve
diffie-hellman

408
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:49,020
why not the the desist this is our ever
gonna implement a new protocol

409
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,059
it has been implemented yet we should be
the first to do it

410
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:55,770
now we should make it as recent

411
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,690
and does flexible as possible

412
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,539
group so come help us what the spec why
not come to

413
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:07,000
I mean some good have opened an issue
that there's the specters of Britain we

414
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,429
have code contributed to this

415
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:11,510
22 a project that actually is a

416
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:15,730
functional at I mean we we have the co
implemented enough to be able to have a

417
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,370
functional and beauty our chat

418
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,669
and I have had an appeal to our chat in
my browser

419
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:25,280
working fully on at it's not to say
that's completely efficient X like the

420
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,899
the

421
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,669
the initialization shutdown sequence are
is

422
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:33,409
bits convoluted so when you might need
to work on that

423
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:37,820
by yeah get up you come hubbell's work
on that

424
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,120
so practicality is important

425
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,460
and we can't rely on pgp just to
summarize the important things that I

426
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:44,970
wanna

427
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,809
drive injure hades and we can't deny
that the web is a major battle front

428
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:53,480
that we need to populate with accessible
critter

429
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,280
and this is why I'm working with the
garden project

430
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,289
on introducing awesome which is

431
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:04,900
always secure messaging or the FBI crime
that they can for this came up with

432
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,039
it's a coalition between the garden
project which offers bankrupted as a

433
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,640
messaging applications for

434
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,650
Android chat secure which offers a
criticism much

435
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,890
as as a must-see for iPhone and Kritika
and so

436
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,600
we're basically going to have a criteria
other valuating other apps inch are

437
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,330
standard which is are they awesome

438
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,750
or not awesome very simple criteria

439
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,010
our principles our privacy by design

440
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,110
practicality and usefulness open
protocols

441
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,130
and the club community it's all very
simple

442
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:37,750
very diplomatic stuff and

443
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,789
we also want to have and to encryption

444
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:45,220
you know very obvious first gaps that
the ability

445
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,610
the ability to control logging so that
you not liking all the compositions by

446
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,200
mistake

447
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,809
which has got lot of high-profile cases
in trouble apparently

448
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,299
and also you want to have guaranteed
eventual message delivery so that if

449
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:01,658
you're going through a tunnel and you're
sending a message in the thing at their

450
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:03,330
gets there when you're out of the tunnel

451
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:08,189
you know when sorta cuing messages
properly and group messaging

452
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:14,740
and other things so thats all I wanted
to

453
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,750
hopeful that's cool so thats

454
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:23,230
all I wanted to talk to you about today
and I really hope that you'll

455
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,850
agree with me that this is this is an
experimental platform

456
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,289
and this is not something that's been
easy to research

457
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:34,658
for the past year because I had to are
come up with solutions to

458
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:38,590
difficult problems but I believe it's
worth it when you can actually go to the

459
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,949
Middle East for once

460
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,400
and show something to people that they
will enjoy using cuz its user-friendly

461
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,750
as a you know has blue has a cat

462
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,400
color schemes the you know

463
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,169
all unification that's the modifications
because that is important part of

464
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:56,320
security as well it's that

465
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,480
it's not just auditing your software
making sure using awesome crypto it's

466
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,220
also be lies in the fact

467
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,419
that here you know North America and
Europe

468
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:09,679
we are exporters up photography sort
least you're I'm from the Middle East

469
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,260
but

470
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,390
a exporters a photography software

471
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:17,350
and the other part of the world is
importing the software

472
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,419
and they are not surrounded by the same
community of people that the pulpit so

473
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:25,500
to them this is a strange part from
another continent

474
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,740
and you can tell them that it's safe to
use but

475
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,750
you also need to convince them that

476
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,080
this can fit into their life because we

477
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,139
it fits into our lives or well I just
look sorta

478
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,529
tool cultured banana arm

479
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:45,730
it fits into the North American European

480
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,429
life because these are the cultures the
produce the software

481
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:52,640
but we need to make it fit into those
lies as well I meet

482
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,340
me too get a foot in the door in the
malleability inflexibility

483
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,559
the web a platform because as a very
important thing to do

484
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:05,600
arm so if you have any questions and I'm
I put you do

485
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,230
occurs I mean honestly I get flooded
with flaming all the time so this is

486
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,590
your chance to do it in real life

487
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,880
go ahead our whole K cool a

488
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,880
yes

489
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:32,240
okay so the question was on Yorkers that
and how in multi-party chats were doing

490
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,250
key agreement okay

491
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,900
keep remain a key exchange so an
authentication

492
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,960
okay so are you curious about

493
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,200
the the protocol we have in place right
now or the future a future political

494
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,210
okay

495
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:52,240
very well so the protocol we have in
place right now is actually very simple

496
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,450
on to the point where the the simplicity
might be a weakness in fact

497
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,110
in the sense that we have we just
generate keys

498
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,420
so SAP user generates a key pair use the
private key

499
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,560
and sends the private key assessor since
the public key

500
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,500
to the server and then the server is
responsible exchanging the key to

501
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,130
everyone else

502
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,330
was so whenever you join the room you
get a list public keys for everyone

503
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,050
and then you can verify those keys using
very 0 TR like

504
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,300
a fingerprint and endured a

505
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,450
and us in terms of weather does after a
merrill keys right now

506
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:29,180
I'll keys are from our old are no
permanent key so every time you

507
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,370
you screwed to capture fingerprint
changes cuz you're generating and Yuki

508
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,440
and this is done this was done as a

509
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,680
quick way to achieve forward secrecy

510
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,940
and also because it

511
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,260
we we we weren't particularly interested
in looking got

512
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,430
permanent storage for used for storing
private keys time because we weren't

513
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,310
sure it was a good idea

514
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:53,260
to be honest in terms of npr TR amputee
are specified as

515
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,780
a group key a exchange I'll

516
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,860
which I can remember the specifics other
the moment I'm sorry

517
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,500
on but the the keys are authenticated
also using the essay

518
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,280
and also at the end of the chapare when
someone

519
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,990
exits a shot from MP 0 TR a his key is
published and then

520
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:17,920
the pub the publication is key is denied
size as verified by everyone else so as

521
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,100
not to be accepted again

522
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,140
and that is what provides deniability
and

523
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,000
an amputee are also not yards a very
similar mechanism a

524
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,000
any other questions yes please are we
using curve to 5519

525
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,990
yes we are yes well it's a a curfew for
519 is a

526
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,600
elliptic curve a server setup
parameters:

527
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,940
defined by daniel burstein which is a
incredible

528
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:53,230
talk for the best I think and we're
using it cuz it has good track records

529
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,210
pretty fast

530
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:58,130
and I mean if that's pretty much it so

531
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,780
Osher Churcher

532
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,730
okay that's it II love to actually
that's a good thing to talk about so

533
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,790
on when I started was only Stanford the
stop occurred to library

534
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,659
which was you know not too bad are now I
i've never used that

535
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,310
actually is a different library are
called crypto GIs which is the vault

536
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,970
and very well maintained by Geoff Mott
and a bunch of you know other volunteers

537
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:26,520
its are it

538
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,970
it offers shot 52 all the other it
offers legacy hasher's

539
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,310
and offers a BS in a multiple and
multiplicity of mods and also recently

540
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:34,800
its

541
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,670
it will offer our Sega someone is in the
country but it's a Marseille code and

542
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:42,430
those libraries have increased and
seriousness overtime

543
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:47,220
in the sense that arm there if you try
to submit something there is an active

544
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,450
mailing list the people who will go and
verified that your implementation

545
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:54,190
a do ask you first if you verify that
implementation matches the test vectors

546
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,070
and and and the old oversight themselves

547
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,659
and they will also look at it and test
for other use

548
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:05,310
side channel attacks and so using that
you can realize there's a trend

549
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,780
a rising trend in adopting those
libraries a lot more seriously and I'm

550
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,930
from personal perspective I leave the
crypto GIs a

551
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:16,180
Weasley came up with version 3 and
version 3 is a particularly malleable

552
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,540
across compatible library that the
release or scissors taking a look at

553
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,110
causes

554
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:24,490
really very promising there's also

555
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,910
I am all the other letters are worth
mentioning

556
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:34,910
compared

557
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:46,440
okay so it's a bad idea because well
it's about you first

558
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,120
the the first sight the first thought
that came to my mind the reason I was

559
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,700
I scoffed at it is because simply it's
an efficient and in the sense that job

560
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,050
was

561
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:57,840
bulky and doesn't work without
installing

562
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,670
a large you know you have to install
Java basically which is

563
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:05,060
somewhat installing Flash and Java
historically as a lot security problems

564
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,290
exactly like flash and in fact member
the

565
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:11,590
browser sandboxing that was broken
dimension in from the 270 days

566
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:15,860
that wouldn't have been possible without
flash be included in crime because most

567
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,350
those always depended on flash

568
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,520
and so Java

569
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,360
the Java Virtual Machine has an egg has
a very similar

570
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,490
a sort of security said a security flaws
that is regularly sport and hasn't text

571
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,080
on time

572
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,939
if ever and it's also

573
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,060
really slow and it's also close or so

574
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,970
you can't examine the source code unless
you're good at chalice assembly can

575
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,120
examine the source code above the Java
binary

576
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,360
easily wheres other you know JavaScript
while not perfect

577
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,590
at least has the capacity of being
easily

578
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:53,470
Fort into like you could have possibly
and you can also exact you can summon

579
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,390
the code more easily

580
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:58,320
then then just you can like a religion

581
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:05,320
checked out yep well

582
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:11,330
if you're doing if you're downloading
the the local opt for chrome

583
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,110
and soon for Firefox then I believe that
you would be protected from

584
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:22,110
man in the middle in terms of being
served the code no

585
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:25,880
0 well we we are so that's why we
encourage users to

586
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,470
verify fingerprints in a way that's very
similar to what your works we have a

587
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,340
very similar

588
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,600
site I'll see really just a Shaw

589
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,940
shop wonder shot 56 such shoddy 56

590
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,450
love the fingerprint and thats

591
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:45,280
a that's the sorry up to the public key
and that's the thing up in just verify

592
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,750
its

593
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:52,750
same way

594
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,850
okay alright

595
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,610
are we're we're currently not using
sorry esse charm on will be deployed an

596
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,460
amputee are

597
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:04,210
and so if you would like to contribute
against those attacks or talk to discuss

598
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,230
the morning to I would love that

599
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,899
but right now we are the country to cut
spec actual reason CBC mode

600
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:15,899
police general in the back

601
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,900
that's a very good point there there
there is the

602
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,620
of course the risk %uh directly that
Google does control

603
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:43,720
does host the local up and so thats

604
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,080
not this early the most the best way to
host it but that's why we also offer

605
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,070
on get her your instructions for how to

606
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,250
install download install your own chrome
up and it's very easy it's not

607
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:00,320
its by just you you download the good
how to file and you

608
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,490
the dist there's a directory that you
right click on click creates a file

609
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,590
and then you load is a filing for and
that's how it works so that's one way to

610
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:08,870
do it

611
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:15,870
yes you just

612
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:19,279
some you just send them you can either
send them a link

613
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,810
to so every child has a link to it or

614
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,560
you could sand in the name of the chat
but

615
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,810
obviously when you do that if you do it
over an open arm

616
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:33,370
channel then someone else could
intercept

617
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:37,069
the child address and join the chat
instead of the other person but thats

618
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:40,710
what that's what used to transport

619
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:44,720
there's also a you can also

620
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,890
choose to limits the the people can send
you messages

621
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:52,739
and things like that but the crib to get
through this will be incredibly material

622
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,490
because we're just gonna use XMPP so

623
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:59,300
those dishes execute clients like CPU
Kansas like Google Talk or

624
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:06,300
jobber .cc seed up to you or whatever
yes

625
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:21,339
yes

626
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:28,340
aka

627
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:31,960
okay so the SIS something I've been
thinking about actually

628
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,960
the question was that are so in the
conversion kit the cutters randomly

629
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,930
generated the canvas

630
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:40,990
well the nickname that you get is
basically like bunny your puppy

631
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:45,570
generated nicknames key pony and so in
the new version after the cat

632
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,190
this going to be accepted the user names
and so is will that make it so that's

633
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,260
your more than the final

634
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,500
and so the reason I have decided to sort
of address this problem

635
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,730
is by making it so that when you log
into cab to get to

636
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:03,730
are let me show you this is the great to
cut to login screen

637
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,960
and the difference between login and
creating a new account

638
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,060
is checked is checking this box

639
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:19,540
so

640
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,220
that makes it so that you can create a
new account every time

641
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,300
if you want so by making its by making
the difference

642
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,160
by making the barrier between using you
all the county creating annual one

643
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,230
very very small very transparent like
this just check this box

644
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:39,220
you are making it less easy to identify
people because

645
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,270
I can just choose to be a new car every
single time why not

646
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,340
a council expiry think when we launch
this like on the

647
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,410
the foster to cut server you can you log
in to go to get to with you gtalk

648
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,069
account by the way

649
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,650
gonna be able to login with any account
you want gonna be able to use good got

650
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,250
to talk some musical TR

651
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:57,190
on pidgin using the Google Talk gone
from critic at a cow so

652
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:04,190
there's gonna be a lot of interesting
things like that a yes which

653
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,390
that the MP otro or a beauty or the

654
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:13,450
okay yes I mean okay so

655
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:17,450
the amputee our skit is the current
version the text version but honestly

656
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:21,170
also look at the code because I think
I've done some improvements in the cold

657
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,020
they haven't murdered

658
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:27,980
the text speculate no

659
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:34,980
no we should discuss to

660
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,010
no but on the thing with a pure charged
that the key agreement

661
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,910
so the key exchange is already specified
in

662
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:50,660
and animal books paper another please

663
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:57,660
I i would love to discuss that no
problem

664
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:30,310
from okay will know that

665
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:36,920
that sounds interesting I would love to
discuss with you after we can just meet

666
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,480
me outside

667
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,130
like um anyone else

668
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:48,130
ok please please go ahead

669
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:57,590
okay

670
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:10,860
Anna

671
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,320
okay so the question that was raised as
that

672
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,450
whatever however you deliver critic at
or any

673
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,570
you know whether even if you have a
local at your sole trustee it to a

674
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,450
certain degree

675
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,470
and how can you get past that so this is
also a problem in

676
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,490
every single other application ever made

677
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:40,030
every single package download on Linux
dilute or we dollar pigeon with a dollar

678
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,300
less distribution with Alan operating
system even

679
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,510
you are encouraged to verify them using
hashes

680
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:50,310
and that's because there really is no
better solution are you just

681
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:54,120
do you can download it there's a harsh
sometimes the hash is stored on the same

682
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,850
server as the server you've downloaded
the file from which is larious

683
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:02,460
and so yeah

684
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,700
%uh your picture to to a certain degree
you are going to

685
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:10,690
have to I mean you don't trust the hash
even then you can go through the source

686
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,060
code

687
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:17,630
but other than going for a source code
ultimately there's nothing you can do so

688
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:24,630
0 up please yeah

689
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:52,150
in

690
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:13,930
okay

691
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,390
okay so

692
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:28,788
there is a suggestion to using PGP to
either a.m.

693
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:32,460
was implicitly just signed a thing a
person sorry just signed a

694
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,200
hashes or two fingerprints or establish
a PGP whether trust which

695
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,969
which is really interesting I think we
need to talk about that arm

696
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:46,969
I think there was someone else yes yes

697
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,630
0 well you can't

698
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:20,040
I don't love you can trust the server to
verify the client's cause the server

699
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:27,040
you know might maliciously 0

700
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:40,100
well that could easily be removed from
the client to well

701
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,220
you have to you have to assume that

702
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,650
the to any part of the code base can be
compromised sadly

703
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,690
over alright arm

704
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:57,630
so a pretty sure someone here had their
country's

705
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:04,630
yeah

706
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:20,080
the current version as the current
version approved a good enough

707
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,650
to be used in people in dangerous
situations people

708
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:27,160
and Iran against the Iranian

709
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,940
regime right now I am Not sure I'm not
sure at all

710
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,080
if if it's I mean hi heck we could do
some field testing and find out but

711
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:39,130
I'm not often higher I

712
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,190
I am NOT optimistic on

713
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:45,490
but but but but listen the thing is like
what when you

714
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:49,120
I have to be responsible when you
launched or every single time it tells

715
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:49,900
you tore

716
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,170
is experiment do not rely on its first
rocket on already

717
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:56,130
this had this the space is warning every
single time you wash it and this is not

718
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,950
to say that I'm even close to being
liked or

719
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,120
I'm so far away from the list them
similar quality is that project but

720
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,410
um I am more concerned with establishing

721
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:08,410
a the best president I can and the

722
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:11,690
helping further the legitimacy of this
platform right now

723
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:16,840
and also providing a product can be used
the can be used maybe

724
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,380
for organizing small political events
whatever but

725
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,700
up cryptic as it is right now I would
not depend on it

726
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,630
for my life simply because this is a
huge claim to make

727
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:33,290
that I don't believe any respectable
product ever makes

728
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:36,970
in the security community and no one
ever should because

729
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:41,840
we're supposed to be scientists and we
are suppose to always assume the worst

730
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,190
a and always you know work towards
making a better

731
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:50,200
pragmatically without making tall claims
and without its

732
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,430
passion for something unless we have
been on the ground

733
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:57,560
does that ourselves and we have seen it
work so II am much more interested

734
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,779
and working on its new perspective on
making it as best as I can and

735
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,590
whatever its use for my I hope it's used
for great things II but

736
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:11,280
for now I advise everyone to just focus
on research first

737
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:18,280
yes please

738
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,090
0 well so ever we have a policy

739
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:29,140
in our architecture life cycle document
that every single version critic at

740
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:29,839
released

741
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,820
has to be tested to be compatible store
first a

742
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:36,960
because I I personally am a big
supporter of the Tor project

743
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,520
and I believe the weekend definitely
benefit from an anonymous d and a

744
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,830
circumvention platform liked

745
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:46,759
and terms of the graph analysis you
store

746
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,460
I mean really are so when when we have
well

747
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,700
I'm already trying to convince the Tor
project

748
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,970
to include occurred to cut in the Tor
browser bundle and so I'm not gonna do

749
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:58,490
I'm not gonna

750
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:03,320
vouch for that now but one day
expecially with critic at 21 we have put

751
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,940
you on a beauty are implemented

752
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,390
an XMPP version when you know we've done
more testing

753
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:12,240
that it would be a really good idea to
have critic at two integrated into the

754
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,140
Tor browser bundle because it it's like
a

755
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,580
1-click charting solution for a lot of
people that works over towards and a

756
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,549
brother et cetera et cetera

757
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:23,470
and I think that Firefox implement
better sandboxing first before we

758
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:27,280
do that a but yeah that's i mean

759
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,650
I I E I'm working on an instant
messaging platform

760
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:34,490
for the other things I think it's better
to rely on the experts

761
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:39,030
over it or because it just it saves me a
lot of work and I really I mean the

762
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,750
they're doing incredible work over there
so we're not benefit from it arm

763
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:49,750
I believe you sir yes

764
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:00,370
it's going slowly as a volunteer thing
it's there's a lot of people in it so

765
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,290
the w3c

766
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:04,860
crypto API Spec there's a lot of people

767
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,490
were you know everyone on this from
Google or Jamal to

768
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:11,670
or so a lot of crazy a

769
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:15,190
organizations law to be a very busy
people so its

770
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:20,060
going slowly the I think the schedule is
around 2014

771
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:23,759
but that's about it I am

772
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,060
its there are productive discussions
being done but

773
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,930
this is something that takes a lot of
time especially to come to a consensus

774
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,629
are in terms of what's what you know
solving a lot of problems and

775
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:37,820
no some people think it's better to do
this in the APIs people think it's

776
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,480
better to do that and this is an eight
yards going to standardize across every

777
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,980
single brother ever hopefully so we have
to make sure we get it right

778
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,170
for the first time what Lisa close close
to the first time as possible

779
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:52,620
so

780
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,700
this is this is me speaking personally
but

781
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,990
are I was concerned that there might be

782
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:02,870
that that this that the sort of effort
might be used to

783
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:08,319
I am so so I was concerned that some
people were inside this

784
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,760
effort or some people be interested in
this effort to use it

785
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,360
towards the implementing the RM in the
browser

786
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,720
which which is i mean and and that this
becomes than a completely actually

787
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,470
political issue

788
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:23,360
but but at that point I think that since

789
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,310
when implementing an API are you should
focus on the science

790
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:32,220
and on making I'm on being objective and
just focusing on engineering

791
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:35,410
because when all of us have

792
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:38,580
I mean a lot of us have I i have
political goals are the same

793
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,610
PI and so maybe some people won't agree
with me

794
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:45,680
but that doesn't mean they should work
with me on making it happen so

795
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,839
anyone else do we have time well it's
okay we have

796
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,310
alike eight minutes so or

797
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:00,070
we're done well on it's been very nice
talking to you all

798
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,640
I've been meaning to come to hold ever
since I was 16 actually and so

799
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,700
it's my first time here really
appreciate talking to you so thank you

800
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,000
very much
