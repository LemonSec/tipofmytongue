1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,109
is involved your expired patents but
that kinda making side

2
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:08,340
excited 3d printing often people forget
about

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,620
is the creating side right because
printing stuff is only as good as the

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,110
stuff you had to create

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,490
and they're basically two different ways
to create things for

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,570
for 3d-printed to create those objects
the first is scanning laser scanners

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,660
can be you know 10028

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,890
thousands and thousands of dollars with
scanners or you're also seeing a great

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,370
center technologies that are coming down
like super low and

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,519
3d scanners so this is at

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,090
this is the face in my coworker there
were there is a program for an app for

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:41,950
iPhone

13
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,680
that actually uses the front facing
camera on the iPhone

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,789
flashes a bunch of whites and then build
a 3d model and and she insisted

15
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,469
it has been used with horrible picture
her that is incredibly distorted

16
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:58,730
thank you to picture her depreciated by
as freaky looking as you've met picture

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,989
but it is you know this is by dollars
with an iPhone app

18
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:06,880
standing up base in a row into a race 3d
model with the really im

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,880
is a really impressive technology to see
on the creche insider seeing

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,509
on the output side but in addition to
scanning things that already exist

21
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,150
you're also talking about creating
things recreating being in a virtual

22
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:20,759
space

23
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,200
and many have you are probably aware
there's there are

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,619
there's had programs like AutoCAD and
cost thousands of dollars per see

25
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,729
but there's also a whole universe are

26
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:35,500
3 programs that allow people to build

27
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,680
things better 3d objects you don't need
thousand-dollar

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,590
had programs have access to it and it
actually a very rich universe

29
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,869
love programs right now and drive them
are very sophisticated and complex of

30
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,290
them are very easy to use

31
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,549
but honest very powerful it is an
example that blender is one the best

32
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:59,060
II and gas to pick up people here from a
red that is very sophisticated very hard

33
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,570
to use

34
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,719
I sit down for a blender and I have
stare at it and have no idea what to do

35
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,350
with it

36
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,330
by if I hit with skilled in Winder I
could make incredible object

37
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,900
I have down with a cold wind of
complexity you got Google Sketchup

38
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,440
missus easy enough for even a lawyer can
learn how to use it in about an hour to

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,590
use this is something that

40
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,920
that we managed to build in SketchUp and
you're actually seeing

41
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,980
browser-based designers and so these are
things you need to download a program

42
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,090
you can just do it

43
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,250
in your browser at tinker cabbie you
serve a God

44
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,269
a game application did teach you how to
use the tools

45
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,390
which is really important because for
many people

46
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,040
thinking in that three-dimensional space
the haven't done it before can be a real

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,799
challenge

48
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,110
and so finding a way to bring people
into that design process

49
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,970
is one actually one of the hardest
things to think about you're thinking

50
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,090
about 3d printing

51
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,709
at 310 another program basically uses
like pixels and Legos

52
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,010
another way kinda ease your way into it
and i won as other one this one I

53
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,518
absolutely cannot use it is beyond my
capability

54
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,989
reopen status actually instead using
kinda

55
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,319
3d space where you are manipulating
objects you

56
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,620
holding the object and then it just
sorta renders it

57
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,940
next to it so if you are if you are a
coder

58
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,290
you think serving code first any objects
second are you into a 3d design

59
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,548
program for you and so

60
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:29,860
that kinda on the design sack at how you
make things but how about when you want

61
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,220
to actually print things you actually
have those

62
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,260
physical object there are you can think
about having

63
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,319
three categories up 3d printer

64
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,540
right now the first one is

65
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,200
mister industrial category and this is
the category it's been around for a long

66
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,730
time if you

67
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,040
when fewer and fewer and engineering
department at a large university

68
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,890
or you were in a design you we were
pretty design company if it's barely

69
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,769
larger have these rapid prototyping
machines and you will have had access

70
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:02,049
them for some time

71
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:05,280
this is that they just some things we
happen to have around the office

72
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,450
and you can see it printed out in kind
of like a a gluey powder its it hard to

73
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,629
come with a plaster

74
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:14,780
and so know if you are a shoe designer
you may

75
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,750
design issue any print out you look at a
menu change it you can do that very

76
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,918
rapidly

77
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,060
if you're in architecting designing a
building for someone

78
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,330
you can print that building out and show
its ban in a few

79
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,039
if you imagine you have clients who are
not used to looking through

80
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,340
architectural plans and can't really see
it needs to be

81
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,830
handing them a model is an incredibly
powerful way to save this is we're going

82
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,460
to build its not

83
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,070
a replica right exact copy scaled-down
what your building

84
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,770
in the computer and it's just so iraq a
consumer products bet you anything

85
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,900
threatening if you're designing a bottle

86
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,220
UK you could design it you could print
out you could hold in your hand and say

87
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,350
oh what this is

88
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,840
this is what is gonna feel like maybe I
why change it I know Apple has a lot to

89
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,040
do you think people would you

90
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,090
do high and industrial and consumer
design are dealing with these a rapid

91
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,180
prototype urs all the time and these
machines that are gonna cost you

92
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,880
10,000 fifty thousand five hundred
thousand dollars depending on what

93
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,229
you're using it for

94
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:14,710
because be on the rapid prototyping you
can also use them

95
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,909
in actual design there are parts

96
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,400
a the new Boeing trip or seven
Dreamliner

97
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,509
better 3d-printed

98
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:28,120
those aren't the wings I snap a few
dozen lives

99
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,000
but its its parts that are hard to build
other ways

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,280
especially to do I believe with airflow
management

101
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,590
by interesting easy way to design a

102
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,070
shapes that are hard to make in other
ways to this is gonna be industrial

103
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,659
world

104
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,830
if you talk to people who've been in 3d
printing a long time

105
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,539
if you are feeling not super charitable
to than you might describe an ass or to

106
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:53,979
be

107
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:58,199
in mainframe business if 3d printer they
they say oh this is what people use it

108
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,199
for a min knowing whether one is now

109
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,840
so that would be there with the received
wisdom in the world 3d printing and

110
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,050
manufacturing

111
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,990
until I they said a couple years ago
some of the early patents expire

112
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,120
and then it turned out that well
actually people really do

113
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,350
wanna have these things in their home
and so

114
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,229
you started to see it first with the
with with a a guy inning when

115
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:25,430
Press radiant barrier in the rap rap
project and and now with maker bot and

116
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,490
other and others

117
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,710
coming together saying okay we can

118
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,120
we can play in this space we can make
views what's making these

119
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,770
3d printers better access to all the
people at home

120
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,419
they print in ABS plastic so Lego
plastic

121
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:45,258
and what's with with your happens if we
just maybe they'll love people

122
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:49,930
and what you've seen is miss incredible
proliferation these machines are Peter

123
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,880
probably maker bot has been downstairs
to maker bot I bet they're a very

124
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,030
well-known

125
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,160
manifest Rep rappers in the middle there
and even the right this is actually very

126
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,240
interesting one

127
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,389
this is the the 3d Systems cue and 3d
Systems

128
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:09,389
is a company that is in the really big
expensive 3d printing

129
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,620
market but even they had decided they
want to get into this

130
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,319
lower-cost well resolution plastic

131
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,699
3d printing market so they were forced
into that market

132
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:26,080
when the pans expired but if you watch
how quickly these things develop it's

133
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,560
amazing to see

134
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,710
how fast quality is improving

135
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,900
in this sorted open developments
basically you on Kickstarter every two

136
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,840
weeks is a new 3d printer out there

137
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,539
and everything online has a new
attributes something different with

138
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:41,400
every single one

139
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,490
has ever knew everything new and
different about it and so is just it's

140
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,740
incredible pace

141
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,120
I've innovation around just this basic
3d printing technology

142
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,379
the other category the third category

143
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:57,560
is kinda big became goes category

144
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,300
a 3d printing these are companies that
buy those super expensive 3d printers

145
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,520
and then make them available to everyone
else so Shapeways a very well-known

146
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,878
example of this they have all these
high-end 3d printers

147
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,530
so if you design something you can up or
the Shapeways

148
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,280
you pick your material to print out and
I'll send it to you

149
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,060
and on was more interestingly they will
also allow you to set up a virtual

150
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,150
storefront

151
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:30,550
so if you're a designer you can do much
to design and you don't have to order

152
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,760
you know I housing unit rhyme from from
China are somewhere

153
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,860
and had no warehouse used on the design
up

154
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,800
and if people wanna shape with a
print-on-demand that haircut new haircut

155
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,690
never want happy if no one likes it then

156
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,959
you're out every time it took you design
designed by you're not in a situation

157
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,060
where

158
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,560
you know how all this product you need
to get rid of pinocchio another great

159
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,310
example is actually worth mentioning

160
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,180
pro-growth really bring it to a lot of
digital manufacturing

161
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,920
together so we're talking about 3d
printing 3d printing it a lot

162
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,769
a the attention but 3 brings really just
part of a larger digital manufacturing

163
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:11,459
ecosystem we're talking about CNC mills
and laser cutters any major credit are

164
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,140
used to make a maker by

165
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,630
is this whole suite of technologies that
allow you to do very precise

166
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,890
will run manufacturing that as a

167
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,209
b.com to be available to people really
change the way

168
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:29,040
at people interact with objects and
we've had is a call

169
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,089
the world around them

170
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,920
and three teachers and also has a rich
Shapeways type system that they're

171
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,930
rolling outta there

172
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,290
there they are sorted everywhere they
are they're buying companies left and

173
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,670
right there

174
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:46,240
very interesting company right now so
I'm

175
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,510
now we've got some industrial 3d
printers you got some personal 3d

176
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,610
printer is

177
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,950
you can use a laser scanner you can use
free software

178
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:00,829
you no idea who cares what why this
why's it matter

179
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:06,170
to be the answer to that X actually it's
an unsatisfying answer and an incredibly

180
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,029
satisfying answer the same time

181
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:12,890
is that it's really hard to say

182
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,569
3d printing is a general-purpose
technology

183
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,040
right it makes beings

184
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,099
and so sitting here we are at the

185
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,730
at the hospital very early stages have
3d printing

186
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,180
standing up here in telling you or this
is the way that he were a used this

187
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,769
this is the impact this is gonna happen

188
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:40,060
is a lie nobody knows is a
general-purpose technologies use for all

189
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,700
sorts of things summer for it was summer
amazing

190
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,250
and so it's just we're sitting here
thinking ourselves so what I don't know

191
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,660
but something and it's very exciting

192
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,279
what we do now is you can use 3d
printing to print things that cannot be

193
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,220
manufactured

194
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,709
manufacture diesel ok I said before you
got pieces over

195
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:03,230
a triple seven and the Czar Peter
they're using 3d pretty because they

196
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,120
want use it for a press release

197
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,480
they're using it because it was the way
to make a dash AP

198
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,640
in the most efficient way possible you
talk to engineers and designers

199
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,480
this is something of a surprise to me
because I'm not very smart and I thought

200
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,279
about it

201
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:20,920
a lot of the shapes that you see in
everyday world

202
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,680
the reason they're shaped like I is
because that the easy way to

203
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,820
manufacturing

204
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,339
by if there's another way to manufacture
a different shape

205
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,740
nothing stopping you from doing that you
go to shape ways especially

206
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,560
and you see your finger and you see the
kinda designs that the jewelry designers

207
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,440
in the sculptors are putting out and
they look like nothing you've ever seen

208
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,200
before

209
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,380
and it's not exclusively because no one
has been able to imagine a shape like

210
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,470
that before

211
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,260
it's because there hadn't been a
practical way to translate it

212
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,410
from someone idea into the real world

213
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,769
and 3 bring can also drive mass
customization

214
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:04,519
when you are printing every single one
individually

215
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,630
changing it is not a big deal

216
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,139
right right now if you are going to make
a bunch of objects you have to make

217
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:14,850
you make one stamp any stamp out a
thousand or ten thousand or million

218
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,510
and they have to be exactly the same
he's got one stamping out the cannabis

219
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,529
can tap the same

220
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:22,910
your printing every single one out small
variations are irrelevant to you don't

221
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,130
care because each one is made

222
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:29,130
individually and so the three
uninteresting

223
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,269
first generation uses this you're seeing
people who have served custom

224
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,040
bobbleheads and and

225
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,500
neo things like with with its custom
script on it

226
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,980
and not understand his if not cool
Bedford like up is everything that you

227
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,269
can

228
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:44,839
here easily a match and from today

229
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,690
brings you start playing out where it
means to be old and mass customized

230
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:53,130
every single object in your wife it
presents an incredible

231
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,870
sweet opportunities

232
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,089
and all this is basically because it
begins to dry

233
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:03,300
creation to the edges have been network

234
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,850
right people who did not have access to
an easy way to manufacture

235
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,260
beings before all the Sun have access to
wait do that

236
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,279
and they do weird things when they get
access to stuff like that

237
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,350
something is really interesting sonya is
really frivolous

238
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,550
but almost all that is something you
couldn't anticipate

239
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,769
and so you know one of my favorite
examples in this is because I'm a

240
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:29,209
policy person and that's what I do it
we've seen alive

241
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,560
at 3d design for protest

242
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,029
so one of the issues that that my
relation with very much involved with

243
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:37,920
was that the so but have a fight

244
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,320
earlier this year and so we saw that the
first thing that person I saw with

245
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,889
3 printed out miss appear the a no sew
but paperback

246
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:50,079
he was that okay print these out and
send them the representative

247
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,139
they notice ok whenever I I'm no idea

248
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:57,850
if anybody did this no idea many of its
got this

249
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,910
that's great I love that imports and
since then you've seen

250
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,560
distorted proliferation other 3d
printing

251
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,350
protest examples are you got it you got
a gay marriage one you got a 99 percent

252
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,089
when you can

253
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:14,089
occupy one you got no nukes one are the
one in the upper right may

254
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:17,279
ultimately be my favorite back gentlemen

255
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,820
is Chris Dodd he he used to be a senator

256
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,699
and is now the head of the MPAA which is
that movie studio

257
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,889
lobbying arm and beefing below him

258
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:34,610
is a decryption key for Blu ray Disc 508

259
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,790
so if it's sort of like a shrine that
too

260
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,829
it to anti DNC a circumvention so you
know you use

261
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:47,290
you you see random things if he were
doing

262
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:51,099
so if that back because and they said
this is the kind of thing

263
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,980
where it's a general-purpose technology

264
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:00,040
it drives creation innovation to the
edge in the network

265
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,459
it's hard to say what impact it will
have to keep putting really interesting

266
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:04,010
things

267
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:09,160
this sounds especially to this group I
imagine something like a computer

268
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,889
represent a lot like what happens with
computing and so

269
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:18,459
that's what we thought to and so we
thought to ourselves

270
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,510
okay me every day

271
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,459
at public knowledge we are engaging all
these digital intellectual property

272
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,639
fights

273
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,019
what do we wish we had done

274
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:37,290
in whenever pick your time 1985 1990

275
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,730
1995 really wish we've been doing then

276
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,560
to make these bites that we're having
today much easier

277
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,490
good luck I love a I love a good fight
as much as the next person

278
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,060
but I really like unfair fight Rai have
an advantage that I've

279
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,810
way 10 to 15 years in the past and there
is that okay

280
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,810
well so what what what what we do what
we do today

281
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:03,089
to make our lives easier in whatever 5
can or 15 years and so i think that what

282
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:04,750
I want to use story

283
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,740
a camp digital copyright digital IP

284
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,870
so back in the day not in a way meet in
late 1998 certain if not earlier

285
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,500
here all these people many of which I R
in this room right now

286
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,009
who are doing all sorts of you really
interesting stuff

287
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:24,310
okay we've got these computers their
connect to each other network

288
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,690
we can go all these tools we can change
the world you're gonna love it

289
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,230
Munich everyone's life better everything
to change everything be good

290
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:36,060
who could not love this

291
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,660
and it turned out that when you are

292
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:45,189
changing the world when you are
disrupting

293
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,089
your disrupting someone

294
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:53,370
and you're changing the world someone
who likes the world the way it is

295
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,490
may not be as enthusiastic as you are
about that

296
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,949
and very often those people

297
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:04,490
are fairly established in washington
what they say look we're huge industry

298
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,049
we employ all these people this is
making it harder for us to pay those

299
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:08,589
people

300
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:12,619
therefore it is bad and so what happened
in mid-late 90's

301
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,699
was a buncha ministries got it won't be
here these his computer is with the

302
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:17,990
networks and

303
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,099
all the stuff it some

304
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,559
more like it so much and served with
this with disrupting what we're doing

305
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,940
and so what happened unfortunately was
the disrupted industries

306
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,130
got together with congress

307
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,110
and I was sort of it because the time
the public interest groups like mine we

308
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,929
didn't even exist at that point

309
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:42,190
and most people were doing interesting
things were busy doing interesting

310
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,820
things they weren't spending a lot of
time going to washington and talking to

311
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,720
congress

312
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,720
and still what you got with the NCAA

313
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,750
and undergoing appearance today the
NCAA's all back

314
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,100
there are a wide apart the DNC that
actually make the internet work today

315
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:05,520
but it's a balance and the balance the
DMCA strikes

316
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,750
as it was written in the late nineteen
nineties is not to balance that it would

317
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,500
strike

318
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,169
if it was being written today

319
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:18,559
if we had the same kind of political
engagement from technology users as we

320
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,410
did

321
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,330
and so that's where the model that we're
using right now

322
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,439
your house houses how's that apply

323
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,309
23 print what the good news is 3d
printers

324
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:35,418
are not computer I mean they are
computers in the same thing about little

325
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:40,070
words member there they're not computers

326
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:45,139
and one of the most interesting ways but
they are not computers

327
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,220
is no way that they relate to
intellectual property

328
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,840
because the one thing that we have
learned is that

329
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,850
when someone is being disrupted with a
digital thing

330
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:03,160
the first toward a reach for to beat
back that is rushing to be back that

331
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,410
change

332
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,090
intellectual property law

333
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,928
and you'd actually kinda historical flu

334
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:16,919
that we associate intellectual property
law

335
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,440
with digital technology it's basically a
historical

336
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,809
look at the kinds of things better easy
to create and share with a computer

337
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:30,910
have got to a network are the kinds of
things that are protected by copyright.

338
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,250
rate

339
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,090
it just you know movies and music an
article and photos

340
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,629
those are the things I've copyright

341
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,110
but when you step away from your
computer

342
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,460
and you enter the real world

343
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,740
you are reminded that most things in the
world

344
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,780
are not protected by copyright

345
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,940
and 3d printers make things

346
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,030
in the real world and so the Hawks

347
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,770
intellectual property are not as strong

348
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:11,400
into 3d printers as they are into
computers and that's good news

349
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,880
let me let me break that down a little
bit lemme can expand that I will because

350
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,830
now everything it was very hard for me
to wrap my mind around because I i aid

351
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:24,129
but I think I've digital policy in terms
of in water property

352
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,690
and that may be good in a bad position
because that reserve where I so she

353
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,510
added

354
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,150
with with the internet with computers
that were you do your thing is copyright

355
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,500
copper copper every step away from the
computer

356
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,590
you look at the real world you find
yourself in a world for things that are

357
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,490
not touch

358
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,299
by copyright release after spending an
awful property at all

359
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:44,480
for talk about copyright copyright is
always all you know

360
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,570
is designed it it applies to creative
things two things

361
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:53,850
that you would hire and artist to make
especially true

362
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,100
in the habit but physical object world

363
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,690
are you knowing all very interesting
discussions about on

364
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,929
you know the computer program or
engineer more an artist you know

365
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,169
whatever it is but

366
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:09,390
in the physical world copyrighted
catching two things

367
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:14,620
that don't do anything have heard it has
anything that work nights

368
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:20,580
but don't don't have a functional
utility you use for use

369
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,590
but copper has a very interesting
features copyright his automatic

370
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,740
there are reasons there are good reasons
to

371
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:32,450
to register copyright but you don't have
to register your copyright c copyright

372
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,559
protection if you are right now

373
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,549
for writing email are doing on your
program or something else besides

374
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:39,620
listening

375
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:44,460
you know that doodle is protected by
copyright by virtue writing it down to a

376
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,549
drawing a

377
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:50,590
that you know is protected by copyright
by virtue I love you typing app

378
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:56,510
and now his copper automatic it last a
really long time

379
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:02,059
right now copyright last for a lifetime
the creator plus 70 years

380
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:07,740
so that dude or is protected until the
day you die

381
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:13,110
and then for 70 more years after that

382
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,980
and damaging copyright are soon to be
automatic you can approving any real

383
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,419
damages for infringement

384
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:23,460
you can get a two hundred fifty thousand
dollars per paperwork

385
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,429
the coppery thing that is is automatic
that is a long and expensive

386
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,970
but it doesn't cover

387
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:36,419
functional items button cover useful
articles

388
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,500
in this is this is the world a pattern
and the thing you have to remember is

389
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:39,809
that

390
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:43,639
hand and copyright are mutually
exclusive right it's a wonder the other

391
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,220
you walk through the copyright or

392
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,320
you what the patent or it's not broken
if the functional item

393
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:55,379
if not the copyright or it the patent or
to our patents

394
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,480
hands on my copyright are not
automatically lead to apply for a patent

395
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,970
you apply for a patent case time

396
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:07,730
and money and as part of that process me
to actually show that it's a novel a

397
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,840
useful thing now you know its precise

398
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,209
Patna on software debates thinking where
the debate

399
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,280
but not right now I'm but dad

400
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,990
when compared to copyright is a much
higher bar

401
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:26,159
it takes effort to do and also the term
is much shorter term a package twenty

402
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,549
years now twenty years is a long time

403
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:34,260
but there is nothing copyrightable
created in my lifetime

404
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,140
that will ever enter the public domain

405
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:42,000
nothing there are plenty of things

406
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,760
their Creator my lifetime they're
protected by patent there now in the

407
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,900
public domain:

408
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,350
and they're setting off for propping up
in either we've touch I'm isn't as

409
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,500
important here

410
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,419
is a trademark and design patent and the
reason that remark in line hand is not

411
00:23:58,419 --> 00:23:59,529
as important as personal

412
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:04,350
it also you can get ray marker designed
and a functional useful article

413
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,409
and fairly specific in this is important
because you think about the world

414
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:09,309
digital design

415
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:14,440
you have a very specific design patent
or very specific trademark and it really

416
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,789
ought to take that object

417
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:19,750
and change in a virtual space in prior
different one

418
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:24,770
avoiding infringing on that remark Ronan
I'm hand even that big a video

419
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,889
and i think is not important thing is
not real when you think about all this

420
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,440
thing that

421
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,820
it if not the top the less but the
bottom line here

422
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,309
the bottom line is that when you step
away from your computer

423
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:41,120
as I said before and you look around

424
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,250
things aren't protected by international
copyright could my notes for this talk

425
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,929
protected by copyright this podium

426
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:53,220
protected by nothing

427
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,049
this wire protected by nothing that
shares you're sitting in

428
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:00,510
protected by napping these neon lights
protected

429
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:04,090
by nothing

430
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,090
and so we think about you have through
all these things you can create a 3d

431
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,168
printer

432
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:14,150
and then a subsection have those are you
going to be pretty

433
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:19,200
tactical by intellectual property

434
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,590
and then a small water so so sure those
are actually protected because

435
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,480
they're also the things that are either
that maybe we're in the kind the pan

436
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,179
universe but what we're patenting

437
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,450
where they were attending be a rip and
in 25 years ago are now in the public

438
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,659
domain:

439
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:35,669
you had this kind of diagrams Liana I'm
on a computer you talking about

440
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:39,390
it would be a 101 rate basically
everything you type up on a computer

441
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,850
in iraq attacks by copyright

442
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:48,360
and critically this is not a loophole

443
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,720
this is not a mistake or an oversight

444
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,210
we've had the ability to copy physical
objects

445
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:03,289
since we've had the ability to make
physical object

446
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:06,760
and international property law is a
balance and we have found that we do not

447
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,090
need to give people a monopoly on
physical objects to convince them to

448
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,929
make them

449
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:14,870
and I know that because I'm standing at
the podium

450
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:20,600
and it exists and I measure this podium
or I even took a laser scanner and made

451
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,890
an exact copy a bit

452
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,559
there is nothing that the manufacture
this party we do about it

453
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,879
and that's okay that's not a mistake

454
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,520
so what's happening now now it's kinda
3d printer is

455
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,950
got assertive crash course in in life or
property law but I

456
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,510
appreciate all you sitting through where
are we now

457
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,559
what we're seeing is that people are
just creating

458
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,029
and sharing and even selling online

459
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:54,770
this piece this Community Center in
Norman are coming together

460
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,049
to answer the question how do you deal

461
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:03,039
with a virtual physical objects how is
this has this world come together

462
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,020
but not surprisingly we have started to
see

463
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,918
some up the general intellectual
property

464
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:16,520
beings creeping in to rotary printing
tonight I want how you start a couple

465
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,240
stories

466
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,659
I'm and and this is just because it's an
example love

467
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:23,970
places that people are sharing and
selling online

468
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,480
and and you can see it actually a rig a
sliding me to do this

469
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,169
by guided a if you look here on the left
there's there's been rumors and it

470
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:36,240
it shows you a diverse the right you
have a towel statue

471
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,539
right that is that you didn't really do
anything you look nice but has no

472
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:43,370
function very protected by copyright you
get a bracket for Rep rap

473
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,700
I definitely picked by copyright gonna
pull cord for up for a lawn mower

474
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,179
that badly affected by copyright the
whole universe that thing that here

475
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,490
better beings but no one owns them

476
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:58,490
you're infringing on the popular

477
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,899
let me tell you a story are the first
DMCA takedown notice

478
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:05,690
in the history of 3d printing I

479
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:10,720
so the Penrose triangle is this
impossible object optical illusion

480
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,190
with it came from the nineteen thirties
is named after mister doctor Penrose are

481
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,870
you know somebody something European guy

482
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:22,230
and out what happened why is there a
last year

483
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:25,960
somebody came up on what a mentor appear
online mister I

484
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,070
and the smartest person on the Internet
today

485
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:36,418
I have big your doubts how to make this
impossible object with 3d printing I

486
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:38,380
will not tell anyone

487
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,480
how to do it are so you 1 but no one

488
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,760
will be able to crack the code is I have

489
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:51,750
and so there to you later

490
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,320
someone threw up a design on thing ever
since that had I to

491
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,850
have figured out how to make is
impossible object and I like the first

492
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,399
guy

493
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:04,840
I was gonna tournament there is to it
are you out but I don't care

494
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,659
and the first guy said no you sir

495
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:13,289
I do not like you anything and I do I do
not like things on my knees accuse you

496
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:18,240
ok copyright infringement and so we sent
a a takedown notice the thing you were

497
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,029
saying this person is infringing I
copyright might be heading down

498
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:24,200
this is horrible now there was an
interesting questions about this because

499
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,950
Penrose triangle optical illusion

500
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,110
which is probably useful article which
is probably not protected by copyright

501
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,600
law

502
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,169
also they said this design it originated
in the nineteen thirties

503
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:41,740
so the person who made it may not have
even if you were picked up by copyright

504
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,419
they might not have very much on
interest

505
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:48,110
there are kinda technical legal
questions about this but it's Wednesday

506
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,070
when this person

507
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:54,200
sent the cake I know sitting hours
everyone freaked out

508
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,960
you know that all holy hell oh my god
the NCAA the main road three pretty

509
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,950
fortunate we

510
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:02,830
it was such a freak out at the first
person

511
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,039
step back after a day or two further and
said

512
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:10,500
okay whenever right I have I dedicate
the public domain

513
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,730
and I withdraw my takedowns

514
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:18,690
so we saw this order this attempt to use
the National Property Law and then an

515
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:22,049
a community freak out and then kinda
backing away which is good

516
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:27,370
but isn't the only time we've seen II in
our for proper you are you to take down

517
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,960
3d-printed object and something that
actually it actually is probably right

518
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,929
I'm this is a cue from the movie super 8
and

519
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:38,880
is a guy guy designed to Emperor know if
you've seen in the Super area

520
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,299
you can I for how I

521
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,559
he he would tell you it so it this is
this is the design

522
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:51,260
and he put up online and got a lovely
weather from the people at paramount he

523
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:51,840
said

524
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,279
we would really don't want you to put
this up

525
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,230
anyone should take it down and he did
and the funny thing is actually if

526
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,600
if we lived in a world of super 8

527
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,890
this thing would be a a functional
objects and not protected by copyright

528
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,519
because you don't have no other city
breaks campus culture

529
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,559
and so effected by copyright and so you
know who all's well that ends well

530
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,720
the the universe are copyright can't
work

531
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,940
when this post to work online another
example this

532
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,100
and is actually a really complicated
example is

533
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,730
this is a a Mac from Warhammer insist on
pick this up

534
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,210
and the war hero para people freaked out
a little bit and said

535
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,210
you know take this downs infringing are
copyright initially

536
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:37,200
they did and that was to begin a story

537
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,200
if this was actually a copy of a Mac
from Warhammer

538
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,019
because the Warhammer Mac is a character
in a video game it's going to take my

539
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:44,970
copyright

540
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,500
but it turns out that this is actually
not

541
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,190
and a copy a warhammer Mac it's just
answered

542
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,700
in this style but not a copy

543
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,820
a warhammer Mac and that bed is a much

544
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,460
more tenuous connection to copyright

545
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,850
an actual happy by this is sorta resolve
itself in a temporary way that many

546
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,730
fingers all this opportunity down now

547
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,799
even find it and never wanted it
happened to walk away

548
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,039
we are seeing good examples are not
infringing copyright not pursuing

549
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,200
copyright as well

550
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,970
I hand menu from there it's over the
pecan your

551
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,559
probably a little bit correct and so the
way the copyright works

552
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:31,789
for board games is you cannot copyright
the rules a board game

553
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:37,149
and you can't copyright part to the
board game that are necessary to play

554
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:40,620
so it's a little bit and made up with
these tiles their shape this way and so

555
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,260
this person made this incredible 3d
printed

556
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,269
sellers have got an outboard

557
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:52,039
the way that the way that this so that
it can people represent sheep and bricks

558
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,750
and stone all those things the counter

559
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,789
images on the tiles that protected by
copyright

560
00:32:56,789 --> 00:33:00,799
but pile shape that way that represent
those things in are not

561
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,600
so baseboard did not infringe on the
copyright

562
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,240
a so the pit and we are encouraging me
not seen the show the pic and people

563
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,620
demand it be taken down

564
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,240
so what is with have been met a message
was the real take away from hearing all

565
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,960
these are these are all the stories

566
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,029
the answer is actually did in look
perfect for now

567
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:27,169
community norms are basically working

568
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:32,169
art 3d printing community and design
community is coming together and working

569
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:36,360
to regulate themselves and we're seeing
that even in the design

570
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,950
oversight like thing covers way favors
is set up to show you

571
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:45,299
where a design came from and where is
going

572
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:48,970
to look back at that you cannot sue
someone in for infringement doesn't

573
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,070
matter because the thing that you care
about

574
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,090
as a community if you wanna be a healthy
creative community

575
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:02,200
is finding a way to identify and reward
creativity

576
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,720
you identify these innovators and reward
them and you can't do that in a way that

577
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,779
does not require

578
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:12,889
massive lawsuits you can be a much more
nimble and creative community

579
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:16,560
the Syrian things like like the covers
but this is just like this thing that

580
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,980
could work in his weird corner of the
internet

581
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,050
billion dollar industries are also build
on this idea

582
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,369
fashion cooking haircuts

583
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:30,429
all these arlo IP industry

584
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:34,570
you cannot copyright a dress you cannot
copyright

585
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:39,010
really fancy dish you cannot copyright a
haircut

586
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,960
and so we talk to people in these
industries they will talk and we will

587
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,520
talk

588
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,668
and we will talk and they all talk about
their influences

589
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:50,638
and about their inspiration

590
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,889
but they will not tell you we're
licensing

591
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:58,450
from my inspiration there have a deal
with their influences

592
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:02,890
issues very important in that community
talk about where you get your ideas from

593
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:07,049
and that's why you're seeing in this
world of 3d printing

594
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,480
and this is great because you you're so
much more nimble I'm aware I will love

595
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,869
the law I think it's really important

596
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:16,660
I do not necessarily think that every
new idea she had to go through a bunch

597
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,259
of lawyers three checked off before it
hits

598
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,910
if the public it it is slow bad way to
do things

599
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,328
and so finding a way to structure this
community

600
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:30,619
but did not require heavy IP law

601
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:34,650
is great and your scene and it's really
encouraging so for now

602
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:39,089
we're seeing this system work so what
happen in the future

603
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:43,020
is coming back today said it is much
easier out how this everybody is much

604
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:47,250
easier to make friends before you need
them

605
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,670
and so what are we doing our make sure

606
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,570
there were laying the groundwork for
that day that someone walks in the car

607
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:57,630
their congressman's office with a maker
by and says

608
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,740
this pirate box is destroying my
business

609
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,320
you need to out why

610
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,030
hey and have it that the good cheer
adventure

611
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,520
I'm you as a general matter

612
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,980
right

613
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,780
me the first response

614
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,380
the something you like this can not be
to legislate

615
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,910
when you see new technology your impose
is to think

616
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:32,060
the most horrible dystopian future you
can imagine

617
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,560
and pass a law is to stop that from
happening

618
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,609
right like the future where beyond the
cops and everything is horrible and pick

619
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:40,880
all going to ship right

620
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,839
this is back Andrea path of major can
happen that's a horrible idea and why

621
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:46,589
that overall idea because

622
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:50,930
first that wasn't gonna happen

623
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:54,799
but second and probably more importantly
in trying to outlaw

624
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,380
imagine a future threats you inevitably
prevent

625
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,200
productive pass innovation

626
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:07,140
so you your first reaction cannot be
West kasam loss

627
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:11,279
their thing to do is to introduced three
for any policy makers we've been doing

628
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,530
this

629
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,810
you know we you may recognize them these
people up here we bring people would

630
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:18,109
bring the 3d printing community to
Washington to Incheon this come find me

631
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:19,220
afterwards

632
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:24,160
and just say hey were real

633
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,920
this is a science fiction and not only
this real

634
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,320
cinerea even a real hobby this is a real
business

635
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,400
we're hiring people were selling things

636
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,170
we're moving into new offices this is
worth protecting our lease not

637
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,450
strangling

638
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,540
booking you what can you do to help
protect

639
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,990
3d printing in Washington 15 the you can
do

640
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:55,640
more than anything else is to use it

641
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,230
because when that day comes if that day
comes and I hope it doesn't come

642
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,930
but if it dies where someone walks in
and says

643
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:06,319
this pirate box industry my business

644
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,660
we want back congressperson that
senators say no

645
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,609
I know these people and they want in the
call us up and we say no you need to

646
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:15,970
protect 3d printing

647
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,849
because this is happening and that is
happening in some ways making this green

648
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:23,020
credible break during an incredible
director in order to get those stories

649
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,589
is a

650
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:27,750
this is how this is being applied we
need people to try new things

651
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,320
to the thing that you can do with 3d
printing is just try and use it

652
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,160
and semi busy do will be great and some
other things you do will be stupid

653
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,618
and throw them work and some of them
won't work and family will be for voice

654
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:41,950
and some of them will change the world

655
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:45,839
but you need to do them because we need
those stories

656
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:50,619
we need those examples to see this is a
completely legitimate technology

657
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:55,359
that's worth protecting and fostering
and when you do that

658
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,098
when you do those things let me know
about it

659
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:02,770
I mean email them yet winner winner
however I do

660
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:07,490
but let us now because those stories
they're gonna help defend 3d printing in

661
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,320
washington

662
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,800
I thank you very much mr. a mentor to
you for for questions are

663
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:18,800
thank you for pre-recession

664
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,130
you have any questions I'm

665
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:27,120
to make in the music industry

666
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,210
as a period in which the music industry
wanted all

667
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:34,510
mp3's bout totally now it's in a
position with the

668
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,410
kinda like rely upon it for money you
have in you and no still want to be

669
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,790
bound for use

670
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:45,160
piracy all the us you to significantly
change once is so the financial

671
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,250
advantage

672
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:51,170
loving spree built on fear beforehand to
visit mom teaching briefing the

673
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,080
politicians

674
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,860
to state the fire the yes this is a
different

675
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:01,120
cuts in will not one that's going to
sleep damaged in nineteen states saw you

676
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,370
whatever put could be to the economic
advantage

677
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:09,480
and present things in a way the Milne
able the politicians when people do

678
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,070
percent the pizza say know you can ship
your business

679
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:16,280
you won't lose out you've only got to
gain from this

680
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,530
yeah absolutely that's very true virtue
great party that the first is this a

681
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:24,550
there is a store and Intel i3

682
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,260
bringing about bringing manufacturing
back United States matt is a very

683
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,840
attractive story in Washington right now
and they say you can move manufacturing

684
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,340
make far a central place to a much
closer

685
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,500
local place we'll also have a larger
point which is that

686
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,770
you have a situation where if

687
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:46,680
an industry finest are confronted with
3d printing and a disruptive force

688
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,359
making work to the music industry any
kinda had two choices right they can

689
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,940
spend 115 years

690
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,300
spending my money trying to get it
outlawing Washington

691
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:59,300
or they can spend the same time money
fearing I had to turn it into a new

692
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,260
business model for them

693
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,230
really take a gander and thats at
working that usually are starting to see

694
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,610
that with a couple companies it's really
encouraging and hopefully

695
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:11,020
the lessons are you over but you're
always fighting the last war

696
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,890
unfortunately

697
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:15,339
but the lesson the last war as embrace
this early

698
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:20,660
you're gonna spend money either way my
forthcoming productively Aon

699
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,379
great-great aqui les on but I wonder
about his love is here geek space

700
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:28,120
then we likey things on the person that
underwent a 3d printing is making my own

701
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,370
doctor who stuffed with you my own store
stuff

702
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:33,180
and when these are doing that at home
and you know that out there how r I

703
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,500
don't know gotta push back

704
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,500
from ministries in that supports Hasbro
say that base yes this is an Iraq

705
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,630
talking about right how I so

706
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:48,120
yet when you when you're talking about
making things from movies TV shows

707
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,759
you already working the world a cock
grand so that's really going to be

708
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,760
it's an opportunity or a to it a
challenge for those companies that on

709
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,570
the right taking

710
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:01,080
been here 12 way they can spend all
their time suing the fans who are such

711
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,069
big band they want design and print
their own version

712
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:07,300
or they can really finally capitalized
and

713
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,960
the hope will be if the latter by

714
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,060
its it through open question a lot again
it comes out her

715
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,740
community norms know what's okay and
what's not okay but it's it's an open

716
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,160
question I have an answer for

717
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,670
pretty good question to be asking your
number one more question

718
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,790
you're saying those physical objects are
not protected

719
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:30,410
but isn't there a our designer um
industrial designer behind it

720
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,470
me that I could cling IP in some shape
before

721
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:37,220
so you the answer is if yes yes if no no

722
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,680
on simply because someone made a king's
army battalion

723
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,259
by the fact that someone made it isn't
the cap starting point for the announced

724
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,180
the question is

725
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,230
white is the IP think you hack and
you're talking about an industrial

726
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,910
designer

727
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,730
very rarely is there

728
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:57,470
more more often than I i want to get in
there kinda spring we'll hear more often

729
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:57,900
than not

730
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,410
there's a not going to be an IP right
attached to that

731
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:04,920
and so if the functional items I am it
does something

732
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,290
your you consulting engineers when
you're building a

733
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:11,500
than effect Mike Patton great

734
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,740
take my cat and thats at a very real
international copyright

735
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,780
by if it is not picked by Pan out to
discover copyright

736
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:23,420
it's fair game I thank you very much
anymore questions of the ground protect

737
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:23,960
your hats
