1
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,440
the cells can you not everybody

2
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,860
what most fearsome Marcel back on
schedule have a cap attack

3
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,210
guys its

4
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,640
I think there's actually one of us here
who is scheduled to be here

5
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,470
you I'm returning from the CDC

6
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,539
a.m. this is oxblood um

7
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,490
motions did you supposed to be here he's
on a plane

8
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,619
that's why we're here I think added
together we mention mental

9
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,680
pounds all approaching

10
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,080
home also I think wrong bus routes post

11
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,690
I'm not quite sure why he's not by

12
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,190
god damnit were gonna carry on made over
here

13
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,770
arm on shapeshifter mama social justice
activism

14
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,350
organizer for the RNC protests the

15
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,619
max um

16
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:47,789
so as a I'm afraid the sounds really
disorganized

17
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,630
think we're really gonna shine on the
cumene and

18
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,890
you that you told me last night that he
couldn't make it so

19
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,440
here we are um so

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,229
I I think the interesting thing about
activism is

21
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:07,759
week we have yet to arrive at a formal
definition on

22
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,160
the no one's really quite sure what it
is although it's

23
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,260
something that gets you in the newspaper
when you pull it off

24
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,060
and usually involves doing something
illegal

25
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,090
play on beyond that no one's really sure

26
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,060
um either its and defacing web sites

27
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,310
or opening up firewalls for a

28
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,200
citizens and foreign governments to be
able peruse the Internet

29
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,580
and see whatever size they want I am

30
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,920
or its a massive distributed denial of
service attack

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,190
against part to the Internet house
information

32
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,190
you don't like om for our part I don't
think we've actually

33
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,510
proposed any definitions

34
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,420
a like pete was saying before there are

35
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,880
depending on what side up to social
justice or

36
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,450
hacking community divide you sit on
different people even spell it different

37
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,640
ways if you go to

38
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,810
all to this store Google or something
useful activism with activism with an H

39
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,560
in front of it

40
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,250
he'll get a ton of stuff I if you get
the CDC proposed spelling which is

41
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,640
packing with to visit Mon benefit you
get one entry

42
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,930
so I'm not really sure what that means
but it

43
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,240
it's interesting that different people
take a different ways I think

44
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,280
this being a certain amount of activity
in the last six months I believe

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,550
with the electoral hippies in the UK and
a few other groups who are essentially

46
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,130
social activists and the at

47
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,540
technology onto traditional forms

48
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,959
organization and social protest then
you've got

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,220
number of people in hacking community
who are interested in this

50
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,280
area I food need

51
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,690
very few people to help them participate
in anything one person could

52
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,740
probably do something in college
activism so

53
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:08,170
it it would suggests that on one hand
requires large numbers on the other hand

54
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,540
possibly very issue or many depending on

55
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,200
you want to involve it it is very
interesting that it means

56
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,630
a number of things to different groups
I'm one of the things that

57
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,460
I personally been trying to work on over
the last year cell

58
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,580
is forging links between hacking
community

59
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,120
and the social justice community other
two very distinct groups

60
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,199
often don't talk or occasionally talk
past one another

61
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,650
on they have very different ways

62
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:43,280
operating and receiving a problem sir
issues and then executing against those

63
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,820
is a project that the

64
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,889
the CDC is undertaking I am

65
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,580
will be starting are we in fact we have
started

66
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,818
I'll a hacktivist application
development group we have in that group

67
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:00,590
I

68
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:07,349
six people I to affirm I know I can name
now the others I just haven't been able

69
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,530
to nail down and find out if they want
their names

70
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,789
publicly associated with this bit wanna
see a technical members as braun pastor

71
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:16,330
who was supposed to be here today

72
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,650
I and another name some as you might
know the mixer

73
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,580
German hacker through Road an explosive

74
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,599
that distributed denial-of-service
application which

75
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,930
we do not endorsed by the way I'm but
he's very

76
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,259
a gifted technical expert and will be
helping so

77
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,409
under our direction we also have

78
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:40,759
a couple luv international human rights
lawyers

79
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,889
I am Not sure that I can mention the
names but a lot of people would know

80
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,169
they are

81
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:49,889
I and one or two members at the social
justice communities so

82
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:53,870
we will try to develop applications

83
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,409
have them spread through attacker world
on this on the other hand

84
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:00,699
I on the other side of the street we're
going to try to get a lot of each

85
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:05,650
social justice groups involved I sherry
interest in

86
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,580
many of the same issues so is going to
be an interesting project

87
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,370
trying to unite or two forge some kind
coalition working towards something

88
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,949
positive

89
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:21,379
she could I um and talk a little bit
about

90
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:25,800
direct action and I think hacktivism
fits into a direct action is

91
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,050
arm direct action is when you take
action against saddam

92
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,210
let's say a corporate entity like the
MPAA or Microsoft

93
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,099
or um maybe a pharmaceutical company who
is denying access to essential

94
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:39,998
medications for people who

95
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,400
linder all nations who can afford them
arm

96
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,759
basically with direct action is you take
action against them

97
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,759
and it can be L Ranger things you can be
on civil disobedience in the street

98
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,569
personally on the street activist

99
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:56,870
arm I do up for just this reason I'm
organizing for the

100
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,020
RNC which the Republican National
Convention amber up organizing protests

101
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,198
against them

102
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,919
and other corporate sponsors and how
they don't represent

103
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,120
people but the rear percent corporations

104
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,319
so long basically

105
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,770
activism is like sort of you know it's
its in that spectrum

106
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,938
what direct action is arm activism sort
taking a different approach

107
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,039
arm most people think about activism the
think I you know

108
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:27,479
people in the streets changes something
like shine K

109
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,180
it says you know IMF World Bank on the
side it

110
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,809
or a you know or if you are dropping a
banner of %uh

111
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:39,330
a building that has the message on are
like a greedy section where they take

112
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,520
over a ship

113
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,639
thats does whaling something like that
so

114
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,169
activism is for the new approach and
again

115
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,870
be ok the effective tool think then in a

116
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,529
getting your message across as part of
the bomb but

117
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:58,520
all the civil disobedience of business
you know mom we get attention to bring

118
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,308
to our issues that we're bringing up

119
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:04,960
arm so there's like direct action
against the RNC you know

120
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,490
be there's people on the streets you're
protesting at there could also be very

121
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,819
well be people on the web for protesting
it as well

122
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,930
home so

123
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,219
as

124
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:26,129
Jimmy close this seems to be little bit
more workshop the lecture and I think

125
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:27,139
that's okay

126
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,599
and so in the beginning

127
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,039
and when defining activism it might be a
good idea

128
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,309
to say at least but hectic isn't is not

129
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,450
is that thing the heck a community has
to be very carefully

130
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,620
we live in the year two thousand if
someone drops out the banks he doesn't

131
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,160
take a machine gun he takes a computer

132
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,199
and it for political group having lotsa
bullshit in brain

133
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,529
protesting against anything there might
be forms where we can say this

134
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:57,680
hacktivism

135
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,990
but if its comes to deny non-citizens
into structures

136
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,310
we had that story without Legion up on
the ground

137
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,640
I remember maybe maybe you can say some
words to that

138
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,079
so I don't want to be involved in
terrorism and i think is very important

139
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,990
for hackers to say we're driven by
curiosity

140
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,639
and not by a denial of service which is
vandalism

141
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,860
or by you now love financial interest in
robbing banks whatever

142
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,399
cell I think at it might be a good idea
to make a list

143
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,940
what is hacked it is in at least from
the motivation and what's it not

144
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,089
said to get also in the media a little
bit more

145
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:39,160
shop and feature on this sure um

146
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,160
although I don't know if you're here for
the last panel

147
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,300
and the prospects educating the mediocre
to poor I guess

148
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,720
a yes I wasn't and that's the reason I'm
standing up because

149
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,380
I think it's a said patriot if this
attack UK trees and then we talk about

150
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,399
that is hacking someone says although it
might be these might

151
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,470
this sameee read the heck he tickets
written down heck is

152
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,470
wants information to be free said it has
to do with living but doing it has to be

153
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,050
by

154
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,259
to real city and it hurts not to do

155
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,459
maybe not even to do with computers for
me

156
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:16,529
okay I mean computer is just a tool

157
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:20,100
and tools might change but the
motivation

158
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,360
should not change because other ways it
might be like

159
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,050
getting a hammer in your hand and then
the whole world it's like nails and

160
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,430
thats

161
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,779
dangerous situation brain um

162
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:35,339
is a good comments and questions um I'm
a little afraid just

163
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,430
and step forward and say what is
hacktivism one and what it is not

164
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,589
because and I think

165
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:45,769
intelligent people can have serious
disagreements over this

166
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:50,930
arm myself and I think fluoresce the CC
we

167
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,410
we agree that we should not be denying
access to the Internet

168
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,850
or to particular web sites just because
you

169
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,180
disagree with the content on any on
whether that's a corporate site

170
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,860
or you know political site the IP
dispute greatly

171
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,569
mmm I think we believe that more
speeches better speech

172
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,680
than the enough you're serious about

173
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,870
the marketplace by ideas that the
internet supposed to be that

174
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:21,350
you not gonna go try to damage
infrastructure Gahanna

175
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,440
country-level on a website level on a

176
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,300
you know whatever back to me and

177
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,690
I think one of the issues that will be
evolving over time

178
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,490
have to sure how to deal with said is
parted the whole

179
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,630
activist perspective is issued civil
disobedience

180
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,550
something we saw through the civil
rights movement it's probably the

181
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,870
easiest example in the United States
where

182
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,079
group certain groups broke the law of
the land because

183
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,100
interview was immoral so this is always
being sorted this idea of

184
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,819
occasionally breaking the law further
social justice

185
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:03,939
now it in certain instances it's
extremely clear

186
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,100
you know party

187
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,199
issues civil rights issues the United
States and other things

188
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:14,699
and over time these things been
addressed and but a lot of people were

189
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:15,769
arrested

190
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:19,310
and they sought to be arrested in this
is one of the things I'm almost

191
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,050
worried about with wit activism that
people made

192
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,779
make excuses to

193
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,230
do something rather extreme

194
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,269
and and and who's going to decide well
is this a good idea or is it not

195
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:38,310
this is more learn of me at the end of
the day the public is can decide

196
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,449
agree with something on on but this is
going to be something that's definitely

197
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:44,940
going to be coming up in

198
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,500
I don't know like ish if you like the
occasion read

199
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,750
Wired News you find out that somebody's
defaced certain website and they're

200
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,839
saying that activism

201
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,069
I'm I'm often very confused i cant

202
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:01,219
tell often the difference between
somebody to chasing web page in somebody

203
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,529
saying they're doing it for political
reasons I think it's the kids become

204
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:05,699
somewhat convenient

205
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:09,589
saying no one is doing this practice
reasons and

206
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,860
its its third quite a few gray areas is
there are

207
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:19,860
all throughout packing in general

208
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,779
should once more common

209
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:28,449
you question and no breach a Swedish I
think

210
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:32,500
actually laid out a pretty good ground
rules for whether not act is not as

211
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,690
did you did you pick your cause before
you picked the site

212
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,759
i think is funny as free logic

213
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,550
that's why 1 a.m.

214
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,110
first policy mister BF remember getting
wounded shows

215
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,000
15 sixteen years ago I homo younger than
mister Joe

216
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,709
on-site at the half I lot okay

217
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:00,199
thing and senator about arm but my
question is this:

218
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:03,220
I ahead expands our interests are on but
recently called

219
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,730
distraction and industry action and I
believe this is Britain

220
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,910
before the deputy wtoo demonstrations

221
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,519
there are some very interesting things
they talked about in terms people

222
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,649
organizing

223
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,810
and in very interesting ways and doing
things

224
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,930
to perot change using all school
technology

225
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,810
useful technology using identity
changing things using

226
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,230
economic systems that were not part of
the mainstream economic system

227
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,920
I read that again very interested and
hacktivism I suppose

228
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,259
because it was a science fiction book
and

229
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:41,579
I went through a bunch a voiceless
bookstores and a

230
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,610
activist posters in New York and I found
nothing

231
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,990
except a lot of a leftist rhetoric that
was mostly anti technological

232
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,649
and my question is think it's important
for the activist community and I

233
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:59,209
whether it's leftist or some other term
applies to it

234
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:03,230
don't care I think it's important for no
people that are

235
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,149
pro technology and see their uses
deposit uses a technology to communicate

236
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:08,000
with

237
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,730
she wrists who I think are very used to
seeing technologies in a good thing

238
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,050
and a I'm wondering is there a way how
can we get together

239
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,279
and communicate with clinic with the
other side

240
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,670
arm I've been in parts and both have
been activist I'm also

241
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,410
here kind of project Knology for certain
reasons

242
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,189
and what can be done to you nineties to
keep I think if leftists

243
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:35,990
or activists can see to use technology

244
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,430
in a certain light there will be a lot
less rhetoric against

245
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,939
and there will be a lot more movement in
certain directions that maybe hacktivist

246
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:45,180
oriented

247
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,279
home but I have no idea how these table
for

248
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:51,480
negotiations we take place

249
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,579
I can us to answer that um I think
technology

250
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:58,509
arm its bad in some aspects and it's
good in others it's bad

251
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:02,329
when Armani oil company has the
technology and they're drawing on

252
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:06,459
somebody's native land I think that's a
bad application of technology

253
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:10,319
or on one issues for us things like
nuclear weapons and the

254
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:14,069
with the thought that doesn't make any
sense at all even a blog half the world

255
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:15,769
say can chill out how they are

256
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:20,860
like how big your out guns are I'll be
the leader technology is a hella

257
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,810
tough you are on I think some
applications of technology earnest

258
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,420
completely useless and bad but then
there's other things the leak

259
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,100
and demonstrations and mustard the TT 0
demonstrations and the 16 demonstrations

260
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,910
in

261
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,469
and 90°c be used we had a whole
communications network setup

262
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,980
where arm we could tell what was going
on

263
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,970
across the entire city like what the
police for doing what the delegates were

264
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:47,509
doing

265
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:51,509
we were able to coordinate using that
technology so I think communications

266
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:54,089
technology can be good when it's in the
hands of

267
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:57,769
activists and social justice activists
and also on

268
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:01,790
as the issue of the independent media
arm the independent media

269
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,860
was baby by using um

270
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,880
like they had a high-speed connection to
the Internet and

271
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,770
that helped the the social justice
activists in that we got a story

272
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,069
on unedited to masses amount to people

273
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:21,060
tourism we had arm satellite up things
and people on cable access

274
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,339
TV stations around the country were able
to download that

275
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:29,379
so I think at the hands of Weezer to
democratize these a technology that we

276
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,120
can

277
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,740
like it's its toll useful bottom as far
as %uh

278
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,320
as Microsoft and Tino you name it what
corporation

279
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,389
arm I don't think they should have day
control technology

280
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,270
its I'm not to disagree on

281
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,549
irish lotto points at I totally agree
with her on

282
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:52,929
I'm really sends a strong a and

283
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:57,039
I think ish if you're my kinda activist

284
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,390
and you're pretty your particular
political opinions don't really enter

285
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,169
into it

286
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:06,010
I don't particularly care if you happen
to be very liberal

287
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,929
mostly clear scissor conservative Julie
not my thing but

288
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:14,049
on the thing I'm most interested in is
what do you think about global Internet

289
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:14,830
liberties

290
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:19,529
you know what do you think about on in a
citizens of the world being able to

291
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:21,600
access the internet being able to

292
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,940
browse the web and send mail to whatever
they want

293
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,120
without interference from the government
or tracking you know they need to be

294
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,549
able to have

295
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:33,260
free speech privacy access

296
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,799
and encryption and is your for those
stains

297
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,840
think you are defied all activist

298
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,850
or your back to the same place

299
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,320
on the only thing that some one thing he
said that

300
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,408
like basic question is what most people
don't have access to the Internet

301
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:56,750
rent a majority of people on this planet
don't have access to the Internet

302
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,360
it's a big gap and right now the way it
is some

303
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,390
most people don't have enough resources
to get a computer

304
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:08,820
mom and thats marking the economic
system we're currently in is

305
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,049
I'm capitalism's pictures that some
people get a whole lotta money

306
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:18,658
and then most the rest the world Esther
support those few people on their habits

307
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,840
I agree entirely although some

308
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,209
I don't know if you've noticed it was a
very small blurb in the San Jose Mercury

309
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,130
News

310
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,289
last month but figures 3 paragraph
stating that

311
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:33,929
the United Nations has released a report
I am

312
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:38,460
and predicting that by the end of 2004
every single human being on the planet

313
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,340
will be within half a day's

314
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,490
lock up and internet terminal

315
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,750
I'm whether or not whether or not

316
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,409
they will have the money to pay this
different story

317
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:55,940
and will whether or not their government
allow them to

318
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,090
access to news sites they want to
actually read or

319
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,928
publish information for that matter
that's a different story but the rock

320
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:07,309
hardware will be there and a very short
order

321
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,899
I think sigh I think it's interesting
that

322
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,070
discern two sides of this issue

323
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,428
two different perspectives you from the
direct action signs from hacking

324
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:18,440
community

325
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,100
he's very valuable that as many people
as possible get a hold of computers and

326
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,580
do have access

327
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,699
I think that's one particular challenge
in its

328
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,919
very noble work to really initiating get
that going

329
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:34,700
might my particular take on this is

330
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,929
I want to make sure that when those
people do get onto the internet that

331
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:38,539
it's still

332
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:41,820
essentially free and disease and i'm
looking at

333
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,129
really have to do specifically with
internet freedoms

334
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,470
by and have all kinds of the

335
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,110
respect and compassion for what's going
down on the Earth's Best

336
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,500
what I can actually do is happening a
little closer to technology

337
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,669
I think that a.m. that in itself

338
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:04,169
mean that kind of work has been going on
for a long time people trying to

339
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:08,429
keep the internet free and
scientifically pure and open to as many

340
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:10,440
people as possible and

341
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:17,149
as uncontrolled as possible and it's
close to its original intent as possible

342
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:20,250
oil arm starring

343
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,659
my name is Ricardo Dominguez some from
the electronic disturbance theater

344
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,950
he also a former member of the critical
Art Ensemble

345
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,880
um about two books that might be useful
the electronic disturbance

346
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,919
and electronics civil disobedience
another unpopular ideas

347
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:40,330
published by atong media also

348
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,750
the electronic disturbance theater
initiated a series so

349
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:48,870
week denial of service systems or
powerful symbolic presence or virtual

350
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,870
sit-ins

351
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:56,270
on presidency deals website all to 1998
in response to the optical massacre

352
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:59,520
against the sup these two communities
but

353
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,779
I had to look brief dialogue with the
both CDC

354
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:08,340
and some other communities not directly
but indirectly

355
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,949
and dumb to the the critique go from

356
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,990
direct action versus free speech i think
is very important

357
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:19,409
up both of them i think is the set of
are valid issues

358
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:22,630
up but again as Tweedy i think is
pointed out

359
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,600
if one has been grounded in long-term
activism

360
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,510
light is so I was working with us up at
the store since the beginning

361
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,879
I was already thinking about electronic
civil disobedience since

362
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,130
the eighties in terms of its
relationship to apt up in aids activism

363
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:42,149
and what we could do in terms of force
multiplying

364
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:46,909
the boys to the community um and I agree
that if we were to do

365
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:52,000
radical denial of service agence any
part of the Internet

366
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,460
in a long-term way it would be something
that would go against

367
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,260
um I think a technologically optimistic
community

368
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,059
about would should look to network is
much of the world as possible

369
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:10,520
but I also believe that there are times
and spaces

370
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,270
where a direct action is necessary

371
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:19,309
and how that direct action is played out
i think is up to you specific cells

372
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:22,918
and I think those cells should be aware
with um

373
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,929
aware of the dynamics that will take
place

374
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:29,899
up when the electronic disturbance
theater did its gestures

375
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:33,460
I'll father sup it is the flooding at um
we knew

376
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,570
that %uh element up and with would be
taken up

377
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,049
about it wasn't the most technologically
a

378
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:46,740
Dept use up the technology but we did
see it as a way to promote

379
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,929
arm in the mass media the issue of
Suffolk these morn what was going on and

380
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,370
she of us and that was our main focus

381
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,580
and the way we measured the

382
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,899
the strange up in action was if in the
media

383
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:03,429
in the first paragraph they mentioned us
up at the stars

384
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:06,770
then that was a victory for us

385
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,779
and I would say about 75 percent of the
time

386
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:13,549
it was indeed a mentioned in the first
paragraph

387
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:18,769
when we lost something was when they
mention cyber terrorism or cybercrime

388
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:23,240
which is what they try to put
electronics civil disobedience into you

389
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,700
but one up the agendas that we have been
trying to put forth his nonviolent

390
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,019
direct action

391
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:32,899
how does not happen online and how can
it also

392
00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:35,960
whole people on the streets um

393
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,340
and one way that it can help in
implementing more nonviolent direct

394
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,379
action

395
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,039
is to make sure that the infor- mation
war ecologies

396
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,169
I'll be there right or left such as when
short of or authority dennings

397
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:54,029
a is that they try to understand the
difference between

398
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:58,620
electronic civil disobedience cyber
terrorism and cyber crime

399
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:03,370
and I think to a certain extent we the
hacktivist communities has been

400
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,640
a rather victorious just recently on May
23rd

401
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,740
dorothy denning presented to the US

402
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,110
arms appropriation community Committee
on cyber terrorism

403
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:20,070
her a dialogue on cyber terrorism and
she specifically mentions the electronic

404
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,750
hippies

405
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,880
the electronic disturbance theater I
believe I'll call to the date column a

406
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,890
few others

407
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,380
and she specifically states that this is
not cyberterrorism

408
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:34,380
it is not cybercrime a and I i think it
to a certain extent that

409
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,600
does allow and give us a certain amount
of leverage

410
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,130
especially when we're dealing with the
media which is ultimately the

411
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,890
the kind process whether we want it or
not the way it spreads itself I'll

412
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,289
anyway it was more of a statement than a
question but you also want to thank all

413
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:50,110
love you

414
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:53,630
for the fine fine work that you have
done and continue to do

415
00:25:53,630 --> 00:26:00,630
thank you thank you Co

416
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,039
Keith

417
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:09,830
ahead a.m. a question that I haven't
seen addressed

418
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:13,010
specifically yet the debt did

419
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:16,629
really makes a difference between
hacktivism and

420
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:21,320
cyber action as opposed to traditional
forms of direct action

421
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,129
in traditional forms a direct action
others this

422
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,549
this is not always true but in what you
usually see is mainstream civil

423
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:34,350
disobedience like that %uh BTO protest
or the civil rights protests or what not

424
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,710
there be part of the whole thing is that
you go into it knowing that you may be

425
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,980
arrested try taken lever and thats

426
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,269
that's very much an accepted part of it
and that's in fact with things like the

427
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:46,740
civil rights movement

428
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,120
in sometimes sometimes you step aside in
fact is a goal

429
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,340
to gain coverage you had people arrested
and you say look these people didn't

430
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,289
break the law and they got arrested
what's wrong here

431
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:59,870
but in hacktivism an insider action that
seems the

432
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,610
the river seems to be true it seems to
be very

433
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,960
wants a very easy but it seems to be off
in a goal that you can pick you can do

434
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,480
direct action but not get your hands
dirty

435
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,880
you know you can't deny service are you
can pack web page or you can even just

436
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,640
put up your own web page it's like I
think this is bad

437
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,179
but then you can say this was done by
cool hacks urs at the apocalypse or

438
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:23,169
whatever rather than this time I just
met his match dress when you want to

439
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:24,690
arrest me tera

440
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,899
and I think that's good in the sense
that it makes it

441
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:31,590
you have to be that much less courageous
to do something it makes it much easier

442
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,250
get a lot more people

443
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,429
active on something but I think it's bad
the sense that

444
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:39,570
in some ways you only want people that
are really willing to get arrested to

445
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,689
actually raise their voices because if
you're not willing to you

446
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,710
pay the pricey may not really understand
what's going on doesn't make any sense

447
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,980
and I just was curious what

448
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:53,000
what thoughts you all would have about
that the fact that it's now an anonymous

449
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,789
form

450
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:58,019
of destiny streets it's not essentially
anonymous I know that

451
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:01,029
I have some issues with the Electra
hippies although I respect him because

452
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:02,510
at least a consistent

453
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,580
and they believe in what you're doing
but they have deliberately

454
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,699
made a point of letting people know who
they are and if there are any issues

455
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,870
any legal issues related to that or any
recourse than

456
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,380
there they set themselves up to the
target itself

457
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,250
respect him for that a lot of other
groups and I just don't know who they

458
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,549
are

459
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:27,240
haxor types I am and and you never know

460
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,490
what they're actually trying to achieve
at a time other than placing a web page

461
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,450
doesn't seem to be any strategies

462
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:37,840
up doesn't seem to be any communication
with the media or

463
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,380
targeted or you you're always left
guessing scratching head what's going on

464
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,769
in some ways could you not use that to
next not always true again but to some

465
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:47,980
extent

466
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:52,250
one of the defining things about cyber
terrorism versus either action would be

467
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,840
that if you're willing to say

468
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,740
here is my name if you wanna contact me
or here is a place you can find more

469
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,110
information or what not or

470
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:02,980
Here I am ready to me made a martyr of
up

471
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,250
that would usually to find you someone
who believes strongly enough to cause

472
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,470
wrong right

473
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,690
that you were doing activism whereas if
you are only willing to anonymously

474
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,760
damage something did you probably don't
really believe in anything beyond

475
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,590
do this would be fine if we took the
site down I'll I think those certainly

476
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,809
clarify things for people who wouldn't
necessarily be already

477
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:27,389
in the No on those kinds actions

478
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:32,590
arm you know when something happens on
the Internet in terms of

479
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,740
you know security compromises

480
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,929
a lot of people in this room the know
about it pretty quickly

481
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:43,019
in whose quick removal

482
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:47,070
home but the the people at large the
general public they have no idea what's

483
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,789
going on

484
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:52,070
and and as long as its completely
anonymous and mister

485
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,970
the case isn't stated very well in the
HTML source code people don't really

486
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,710
have any way of knowing

487
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,889
why this site went down

488
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:05,760
particularly if it's a anonymous
distributed denial of service attack you

489
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,620
there can be myriad love conclusions
drawn

490
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,350
on so yeah it's important that people
least explain what they're doing

491
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,409
even if they don't necessarily identify
themselves

492
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:20,590
yeah arm I think turn on mister um

493
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,809
action activism comedian and I think

494
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:26,970
there's lotsa tools and then the
activist toolbox arm

495
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:30,320
activism technology can be one of them
direct action the streets civil

496
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,899
disobedience is another one

497
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:36,029
and there's plenty of other our own
actions that people can take that aren't

498
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:39,240
both public and non-public and its you
know

499
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,049
we can use all the money there's view as
it has anybody heard about Adbusters and

500
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:44,668
other

501
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:47,669
there's a hole on property enhancement

502
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:51,169
thing that they do as far as billboards
they all turned on to

503
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:54,690
say different messages and stuff like
that so long

504
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,730
I think you know that's that gets that
which is a different kind

505
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,779
people than you know are not mystery and
you're sorta at the whim

506
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:04,799
love corporate media Hughes videotape EU

507
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,649
and you made your lucky that you have a
few I'm see people there but

508
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:13,130
arm know I'll have no problem with
people who do announce actions is on

509
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:13,630
this you know

510
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,860
user you know the other target you have
an issue you explain it

511
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,019
on as long as you do that on the you can
do non sections all you want

512
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:26,389
think they're just as they're both very
valid on that note arm

513
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:30,260
and I Section places like China and
Russia is very important because

514
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,720
in places like China even putting a web
page your free speech is totally

515
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,639
impressed

516
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:38,029
you risk execution I'm just for your
words

517
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,059
cell anonymous anonymous action is very
important

518
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:45,059
places like Russia also the police
angels rating the ISP's

519
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:48,149
I'm with black boxes they can track you
know

520
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:51,870
what you do cell make martyrs of in the

521
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,509
is an important thing ordered set
yourself up for that takers must leave

522
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:57,049
Iraq is important but not

523
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:00,519
menacing in some countries other on one
thing you should point out as it's not

524
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,090
just the

525
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:06,389
currently totalitarian informally
totalitarian regimes that are installing

526
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:10,350
black boxes switches it's happening all
over

527
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:14,380
and you know sting like a national
honest

528
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,649
if you know even if you think your
country is spying on you

529
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:23,210
you know the US is

530
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,990
I just want to say one thing about
martyrdom bomb I do

531
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,380
direction on the streets and I in no way
wanna be a martyr hit

532
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,870
I am totally against that I can

533
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,990
you know you know what happens happens
but I don't tell I get my crack

534
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,670
in my head cracked in Indy all happy
about it you know I don't accomplish

535
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,520
anything

536
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,420
so another knock at my head cracked in
you know if I can

537
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,820
so try to avoid that whole

538
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,800
ahead cracking yet head tracking thing
in the morning I

539
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,080
like and you know change the world
without in my head cracked open on do it

540
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,200
whose first um

541
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,200
paid like it both ears opinions

542
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,270
as far as the Internet far you know

543
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:12,580
you said with in a couple years that we
would have it is walking distance is

544
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:12,980
only

545
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:18,190
and %um just him argue that that's a
good thing as far as free speech goes

546
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:22,230
things like that but I E I'll had the
overwhelming feeling that

547
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,970
the people there sure there any engine
and one for the rich for the reasons

548
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,340
that the one for the TV

549
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,070
to promote consumerism and and have you
go to you know

550
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:33,790
coca-cola's web page so that you know
people in countries that don't have the

551
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,740
internet now can learn they can order
cialis call over the Internet

552
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,930
or some other product and not to demean
talk whole earning

553
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:43,360
and I've also shelf sure a while

554
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,650
that %uh the hacker community the
problem the hacker community

555
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,760
they don't not against anybody here

556
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,060
but but a generalization is a lot of
times

557
00:33:55,060 --> 00:34:00,010
I don't feel like a lot of the are very
active weather involved in any issues

558
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:03,600
in a minute I feel like it takes a
hacker related specific issue

559
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,980
trainee hackers to say we issued streets
in protest like the kevin Mitnick edge

560
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:13,600
and until what you think we should do or
try to do too

561
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,750
a keep the internet about free speech in
about communicating

562
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,270
not about corporate consumerism and to
get

563
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,780
hackers involved in social issues
regardless in

564
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,230
right-wing lettering anything like that
that or ingest

565
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,530
related to selfish hacker ideals

566
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,669
um I want to address the first point and
then

567
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:39,449
mountain chains on second point um are
there a lot of vested interests that

568
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:42,839
want very high internet penetration on

569
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:48,020
I think you know big business has a very
good reason for wanting

570
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,460
everybody on the trees were planted able
to to you bands

571
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,679
or buy stuff ASI de om

572
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:58,820
but that's fine I don't care about that
as far as i'm concerned.

573
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,990
ninety percent other traffic on the
internet can be purely commercials far

574
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:03,740
as I'm concerned

575
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:08,840
but their last 10 percent is two-way
communication its me being able to

576
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,530
put up information for people who are
interested in it

577
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:16,610
and it's unlike any other medium that we
have except maybe

578
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:19,820
if you have a printing press or us you
know

579
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,990
shortwave radio you know um its two-way

580
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:28,140
and it's fundamentally different from

581
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,240
television so I don't care why they do
it

582
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,340
I'm just I'm I'm voting for

583
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,920
total internet domination I E

584
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,710
I wasn't in it was like television has a
%uh I'm under the impression that

585
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,290
they would like to make it like hell
only to try like both

586
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:51,740
but I one knows what you think should be
done to try to prevent things like that

587
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,770
I'll try to get people more active well
I don't think we have to do anything I

588
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,620
think you know

589
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,940
the the simple two-way nature net
scandia

590
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:05,650
it's a huge insurmountable problem for
somebody who wants to completely

591
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,150
dominate

592
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:11,770
unless they had a governmental level
decide to block access to

593
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,790
everything but specific sites and from

594
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:21,340
any problems selection which we already
have on

595
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,380
but in terms of getting hackers

596
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:30,080
politically conscious and ideas I would
like to respond to the first boat

597
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,110
arm I think that internet is mostly I
mean

598
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:37,350
on look at who owns the phone lines mean
it's not just you know

599
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:41,250
people in this room probably don't own
the phone lines it's no lawn a

600
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,170
constraint

601
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:45,250
you know is he's big chunk conglomerates
that only a

602
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:49,090
the the phone lines in this system said
its run on

603
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:52,150
arm and they don't do that you know

604
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:56,030
me be nice to hackers are be nice to
people who want to communicate d do that

605
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,190
so they can make money

606
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,690
and that's what they're about they don't
care about free speech and

607
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,120
things like the MPAA like 2600
distributing

608
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,430
arm you know reporting on an issue and
they're being attacked for that

609
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,990
armed or not about free speech they're
like the the own

610
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:16,290
what the medium that is being arm you
know the medium that the information is

611
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:16,940
going on

612
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,170
and they can control it and they

613
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,440
dole they will try to control it as much
as possible on a deal

614
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,010
come up with every way to control but
thats that in their interest to

615
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,310
there something that challenges their
their authority than

616
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:33,740
no day on the phone lines they can

617
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,640
noon that's pretty much there there
government in their system

618
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,410
to play with I can see it that way only
because I think

619
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:47,279
we women shut down a long time ago strip

620
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,200
but the yen used or other a civil to the
signs everybody but I think the

621
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:57,500
on the reasons that you know that their
trying to make it like TV

622
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,470
trying to use it is because it's a
money-making I enterprise for them in

623
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:04,870
out rather see the Internet be about
communication and yes about

624
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,020
communication

625
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,170
personally if I think we got River
things like capitalism

626
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:15,950
unit would be great by

627
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:20,400
freedom of the press is limited to those
who own one AJ liebling

628
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,750
all now now we can all in one for mine
and for monthly

629
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,100

630
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,270
some getting hacked to hackers into the

00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,380
that actually happened arm

641
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,110
ought to like you know dewey
communications work on the street how to

642
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,810
get better communicate amongst people
who are like

643
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,910
across the city and try to figure out
you know what they should do

644
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,970
because the police a cheer gassing
pepper spraying over here and there

645
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,250
there's all these republicans impress
over here they're all trying to

646
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:30,780
you know get to the the fuck center

647
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,760
as for the having a convention

648
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,840
and no one point out that was cam porn
here noticed he had this thing is you

649
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,100
actors in terrorism more new hope for
something

650
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,980
on a new hope n observed for yeah

651
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,470
anyway %uh you going to church in other
words view of the Act web pages for

652
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,030
activism

653
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,550
they the very very similar to regular
activated

654
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:59,070
still say you know attacked by some
really do preach to me

655
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,170
Bob joanne's month ago Anne

656
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,760
in the autumn black backgrounds and
Asian in front page

657
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,620
but kindest the point is that they look
very very similar a buzz

658
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,730
I don't blame the differences in
together I mean

659
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:16,130
they both very very similar me I see

660
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:19,580
mean every now and then you'll see one
that just has the message that won't be

661
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,620
signed but thats

662
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,650
100 I think it's really a problem in
tactics

663
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:28,150
if you're really trying to get your
point across and

664
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,620
you choose to do that by interfacing web
page

665
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:36,230
you're sort of throwing yourself in with
all the people who defaced web pages

666
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,370
before

667
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:40,620
Thomas its clever home

668
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:44,410
um I think that's inevitable home

669
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:49,430
but then again there's a lotta room on a
web page for all kinds a text so

670
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:53,879
if you really want to explain what you
were doing you certainly could do

671
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,980
arm I'd like to come back for in sick
into the

672
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,530
difference between and then a action and

673
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:05,410
directoral in action when you name it
cuz

674
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:09,290
I said in the beginning that I don't
want to be in the same part of

675
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:13,350
like group people who do you terrorism
or whatever

676
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:16,350
arm and when we have

677
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:20,640
political issues we have in the internet
the ability and that's that

678
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,910
10 percent were talking about and I hope
it's getting more

679
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:28,129
to have our own organization and to use
these netbook is a structural

680
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:31,810
amplifier power our activism but this
freedom

681
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:35,410
we have um will be um

682
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,620
did is more under control is more

683
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:43,100
shit happens in in the meaning if is
more people DP's

684
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,930
web pages on make disability knowledge
service to take the mall the government

685
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:49,609
has reason to say hey we need to speak
alone system

686
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:53,060
we need this police everywhere and and
so on

687
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,560
and and this what I mean is we're is

688
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,380
the freedom we have by saying by having
too much tolerance to people just doing

689
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,420
bullshit just defacing web pages

690
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:08,050
is I mean we are here under our own a
little bit and

691
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:12,130
we can face it ninety five percent as
teenagers doing bullshit

692
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:15,470
mean it's it swept perfidy okay it's
nice but

693
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:19,359
it's not be a political issue it's fun
yes but

694
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,680
excuse me it's its teenagers fun so

695
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,779
and and it's not real political issue
and also its

696
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,720
its there for about a few minutes then
it's a way and then you have the police

697
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,680
investigation and then we have that
kevin Mitnick shit

698
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,540
and I mean as a computer free im sorry
I'm

699
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,930
needy little bit too convenient and
running around on the street

700
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:44,460
it's so I'm convenient you have that
rain outside you have the policeman

701
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,570
handed are in that and ingeniously tree
protesting

702
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:52,370
then you have these again provocateurs
doing except the same thing

703
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:55,660
throwing the Thursday least and giving
the police a reason

704
00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:00,020
to hit you and I don't want to get into
exec that situation in the Internet

705
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,560
because I have been on the street and
its for me it's too inconvenient

706
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:08,350
everyone can make his own experience and
I'm appreciate you do still thinks that

707
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:08,850
I am

708
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:12,600
get too convenient I'm sorry but so I'd
like to keep their freedom on the net up

709
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,730
and I think we really get to be careful

710
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:18,359
on where we say that's okay that
activism in but we say

711
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:22,060
tape disk is the that's bullshit um

712
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:27,380
I think it's good point

713
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,500
it's a good play especially in regard to
the idea that

714
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:37,180
Tom you don't want to give to government
more excuses for more restrictive laws

715
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,970
more funding for

716
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:45,300
probably overzealous investigations and
prosecutions

717
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:50,510
for what amounts to you know somebody
renaming a text file and Canadians

718
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:55,950
on the content on but on the other hand
I think

719
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:59,950
I think that's inevitable least in the
westernized countries that

720
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:03,400
they're looking for it an excuse whether
it's

721
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,930
a result of hacktivism or just downright
delicious attack

722
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:10,020
and they upon you examples I don't think

723
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,190
I think if all the action is a night out
tomorrow they would still find enough

724
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,310
justification for

725
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:18,350
you know increased internet police state

726
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:23,069
um so I think the only real effective

727
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:27,450
organization against that is you know

728
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:31,030
trying to contribute to things like
ripped off her she's trying to

729
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,480
contribute to things like

730
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,800
in well and I want to endorse freedom
that

731
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:42,800
to be

732
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:56,680
his

733
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,430
right um so the comment was

734
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:04,600
was as time goes on the government is
increased encroaching more and more on

735
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,750
our rights

736
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:09,820
I think that's what you're saying and
eliminating the possibility that some

737
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,460
they were gonna have a very good
solution

738
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,250
for most people and I i think thats true
so

739
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:19,260
but I think that's true regardless what
happens

740
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:23,800
with all activism I think we have to
work hard to

741
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,150
to help reinforce those people who are
trying to do those things

742
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:34,380
I say you know go renew your your first
membership tomorrow

743
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,920
home its lawyers are activism goes and
say

744
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,150
like you know some people you think are
terraces up arm

745
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:45,580
I think about activism I think that a
lot of them anti-choice people

746
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:49,330
I don't consider them activists I
consider them arm

747
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:52,529
for me an activist social justice
activists yet to be against

748
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:56,410
all forms of oppression not just on you
know

749
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:59,720
not just one issue or like be against
you know

750
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,240
the to the denial like free speech us to
be against all forms of oppression

751
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,609
sexism homophobia racism classism

752
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:11,210
arm so I think you know we consider
define ourselves that way

753
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:15,600
and for the night there's %uh against
the anti-globalization movement in

754
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,280
europe

755
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,760
their movement was actually coopted by
the the left wing

756
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,089
movement was coopted by the right-wing
movement because

757
00:46:23,089 --> 00:46:26,640
the right knee movement there basically
fascists and their national is so

758
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,420
they're against the

759
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,150
globalization economic system because
they're all about nationalism but

760
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:32,130
they're also

761
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:36,170
you know arm draws a racist in cute
sexist in

762
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,250
there also you know classes as well but

763
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:43,760
just in a different way

764
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,670
hi um just like to make a comment about
one of the dangers

765
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:51,770
activism as a concept

766
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:55,690
thats because it's such a new word

767
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:59,480
for this kind is this kind activists we
shouldn't let

768
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,500
the word stray too far from its route on

769
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,980
activism generally implies

770
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,150
not only tactical protests but

771
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:14,650
strategic approach toward making social
change

772
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:18,280
when people think of hacktivism the
generally think a website axe

773
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,310
and people defacing things and other
tactics

774
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:26,250
they're not do not necessarily strategic
if you want to use activism is a means

775
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,510
to change things you need to take a
strategic approach as well as

776
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:32,790
a series a tactics and

777
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:35,970
you know one thing to note be like gun

778
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:42,080
let the Internet and you know is is a
medium for communication

779
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,790
but it is when when when you love
something happens and there's more to it

780
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:46,270
than just

781
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:51,020
just the media most people just see the
medium they don't see that it's also

782
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:55,460
a different audience you wouldn't go in
protest the year

783
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,950
you know I have a street protests a
direct action protest

784
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:03,640
about dad India injustices against Falun
Gong group in North Dakota

785
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:08,060
you wouldn't do it the audience is wrong
it's the wrong place to do it

786
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:11,140
however you know people seem to make the
same

787
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,259
mistake on the Internet one thing to
remember is that your audience is

788
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,500
different

789
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,100
the things that you protest it's a tool
is very valuable

790
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,630
you wanna miss use it to the wrong costs

791
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:27,560
you know it's really is know it's true
it's pretty hard to make a mistake was

792
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,500
something like direct action is it's a
it's a physical thing

793
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,180
everyone has a physical representation
every person on this planet the joint

794
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:34,680
interface

795
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,859
the joint influence has has a physical
manifestation body you can go to that

796
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:39,759
person

797
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,280
she and talk to them on the Internet the
people that you're talking to

798
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,810
you know I'm not the earth on done
Chinese they're not the

799
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:51,620
the people you're dying of AIDS in
Africa that they don't have access to

800
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,220
not there

801
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:56,080
was not that's not your audience anymore
and that has to be no

802
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:00,089
yes to be taking note the people you're
talking to are the year

803
00:49:00,089 --> 00:49:03,740
you know the by the white bread American
families who let me

804
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,710
I am TV raise the children the people
who don't go outside not gonna see the

805
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:08,630
street protest

806
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:11,750
and if they do they just gonna think
it's a nuisance visits making noise and

807
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,460
get your television

808
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,790
Sony be aware also the changing audience

809
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:20,109
as well as the change in medium when you
apply your tactics makes you have a

810
00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:20,839
message

811
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:25,160
and dreaming at the right place now just
firing blanks up in the sky

812
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:30,830
by

813
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:34,040
one of the problems that I think arises
is the

814
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:39,060
sendak by the confusion mean the
confusion between activism in terrorism

815
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,500
is on

816
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,690
really when it comes down to terrorism

817
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:47,569
by definition is instilling fear 3 some
action

818
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:50,730
and what we're saying before about on

819
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:55,040
you know when you when you see for small
how similar they do appear

820
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,460
and a lot of times a anonymous

821
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:01,870
with defacement were arm

822
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:05,490
which seems seemingly unprovoked to the
corporation

823
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:09,650
that does it might be seen as an
anonymous unprovoked attack

824
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:13,800
which will typically it's still more
fear then

825
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,609
knowing who's protesting their purposes

826
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:21,990
why and when that's when it's that
perceived unprovoked attack

827
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:25,540
instilling fear it's much quicker to
call that a terrorist action

828
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:29,130
then peace activism and once

829
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,920
depress for the government for the
general public whatever powers maybe

830
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,030
have labeled something

831
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,200
an act of terrorism people are less
likely to look

832
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,270
at the intent and the people who did and
thats

833
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:44,339
the more important when people don't
claim don't take credit

834
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:48,130
for their actions and doing it so I see
the anonymity

835
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:51,170
as the perceived anonymity as

836
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:54,339
only a good point because

837
00:50:54,339 --> 00:50:58,480
as we said before it might allow more
people to feel like they can get

838
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,940
involved

839
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,050
it's also kinda

840
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:07,650
in a way setting oneself I'll to be in a
situation where they're installing more

841
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:08,410
fear

842
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:11,640
and creating more friction between the
company

843
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,900
or the group worthy you get the idea

844
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:18,790
people supporting the idea and the
people who don't support it

845
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:22,870
I mean it's it's a situation what is

846
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:26,330
use fear leads to hate and

847
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:32,720
hate leads to suffering as you notice

848
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,330
yeah possibly also asked about this a.m.

849
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:40,299
in a different way I agree I think I am
anonymity is sort of a double-edged

850
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,310
sword

851
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:45,319
if there's no explanation for what's
happening is

852
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:48,330
is just another webpage hackers just
another

853
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:52,210
internal service or whatever the tactic
happens to be

854
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:56,300
if if it comes out the blue there's no
explanation and there's no

855
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,960
clear reason for why it would happen
then

856
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,230
the speculation always runs wild and I
mean

857
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:07,960
I think you're gonna see people and we
may have seen it already where

858
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:12,550
I'll a group perform some sort of
activity and somebody else to size take

859
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:13,330
credit for it

860
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,330
adjusted further kearsarge

861
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:19,600
you know whatever reason on it

862
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:25,109
nothing to prevent that night I suspect
it's already happened

863
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:28,600
the last words she alone this is
something about

864
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,770
terrorism in as people can sometimes is
further

865
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:34,839
from the activism first reaction direct
action

866
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:37,940
on as you know a lot of times like

867
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:42,280
a sick the police prayer example of the
police are being trained

868
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,630
National Museum preparation for the
protest happening this summer at the

869
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:50,250
Republican National Convention & in
philadelphia and felt Los Angeles

870
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,339
on the Democratic National Convention to
being trained that

871
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:56,980
the activist they don't care about the
they're not there for any issues

872
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:00,330
they're only there because they want to
confront the police and that's

873
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:02,910
absolutely not true that's totally false
but

874
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:06,470
what it does is and makes the police
think that were out to get them

875
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:09,030
and that makes it sort of like they
think that we're terrorists and it's

876
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:09,720
easier

877
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,819
to crack the head 0 they can't open up
somebody who think is out to get you

878
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:17,290
into somebody who's like says that are
not out to get you but they're

879
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:21,040
here because they don't agree what's
going on so

880
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,080
assist another example of how people to
me

881
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,980
on the misinformation Mb turn people
into

882
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:32,030
but people call terrace

883
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:35,270
in last week's Lee

884
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:38,580
well other than that I just like to
thank 2600

890
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,020
