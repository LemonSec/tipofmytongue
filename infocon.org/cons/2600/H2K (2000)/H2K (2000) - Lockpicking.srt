1
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,400
old

2
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,300
K okay

3
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,790
okay welcome at the lot big workshop

4
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,200
and sorry about the delay but there's
not much we can do about that

5
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,629
a.m. but we're here anyway you're
daschle let's get it started

6
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,530
I am when I start talking about
lockpicking

7
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,160
a

8
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,760
I want to explain how it works but all
of also it's important that

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,370
you understand that this is not a
technique to break into houses

10
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,840
there is no really I mean people always
laugh when I tell this

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,940
I will give some examples on how to
break into a house because all the

12
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,670
problems no

13
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,260
and and then you understand that
lockpicking is more sports

14
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,229
and it is useful of doing illegal stuff
and

15
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:27,759
my name is very I'm the key and this is
how much unicorn

16
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,820
right we're both from home

17
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,200
from Holland and we are members of the
Dutch

18
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,289
for group and VHS which

19
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:41,840
a is a funny name if you're Dutchman
you're not so you don't understand

20
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,039
a yeah

21
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,149
okay well in holland you have something
called the end fay

22
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,720
and the %eh NVS age

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,479
and that's the club that does the sexual
revolution

24
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:00,720
so when you have the NPHS people say are
you into the NBA Jess but

25
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,250
they think something else anyway

26
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,410
I am well not stack

27
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:13,550
right yeah I think we should start a
like barry already set will not

28
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,380
criminals

29
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,510
we only interested and solving puzzles

30
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,880
and basically a lock is just another
kind of puzzle

31
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,900
right I if

32
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,540
if you are interested

33
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,410
and and solving puzzles I you can do it
and to where she can do it all by

34
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,730
yourself which is quite lonely

35
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,700
or you can create Sporting Group and

36
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,530
do it together and learn from each other
and that

37
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,800
what we have done and the Netherlands a

38
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,920
we basically copied a

39
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,090
some things from the germans who are
actually doing a church

40
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,319
a much lot much longer already

41
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,050
and even have championships and and
picking locks and opening locks

42
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,300
an where to start

43
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,400
from that is and if you want to pick a
lock

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,200
if you want to solve that puzzle
actually have to

45
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,260
understand how will all actually works

46
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,720
ride a how many of you and his room

47
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,640
a know how a basic lock works

48
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,810
well thats

49
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,770
that was amazing quite amazing indeed
but still

50
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:37,520
for for the auto a about 75 percent

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,880
a.m. we might go into detail

52
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,430
just a little bit more and to do that we
have a

53
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,780
while we can do it I don't buy a

54
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,780
showing a lot showing some pictures okay
an

55
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,599
I think before we do that we explain a
bit more about it

56
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,930
breaking and entering part what we are
not when we are not busy

57
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,469
K this is what they call a a a lock
cylinder that's very popular in your

58
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:08,540
area in Europe

59
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,108
and therefore it's called the Euro
chillin and

60
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:15,370
its be foot in the door like this and

61
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,680
once groomed one big long screw holding

62
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,860
in the door and the good thing about
this is that when you buy a lock

63
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,060
you can usually related to open your
door you

64
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,780
remove the screw a.m. with another
locking

65
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,500
with the school back in and you change
the lock and that's more easy than any

66
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,580
other system

67
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,840
there is the best part is that there's
only a small piece of

68
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,770
metal weirdest rewetting and actually
it's something

69
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,948
that the you you can see the whole here
I am

70
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,770
that the burglars found out that if you
just drive a screw in here

71
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,940
and you pull it block will break shall

72
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,979
this is an example of that

73
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,889
just the look is completely a broken off

74
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:05,949
and special extraction tools

75
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:10,669
but also made to show anyone who's
interested in burglary just get a screw

76
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:15,120
drive it into the lock and you can just
pull it out also if the lock sticks out

77
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,010
a little bit

78
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,490
you can just grab it with Nash maybe
pliers which unfortunate and

79
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,130
the lock image is really a tiny piece of
metal it's actually owning

80
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,729
Jul and that's that's how people break
into houses without making noise

81
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,770
within five minutes so lockpicking will
take you if you I'm

82
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,990
if you're interested it will take you a
lot of time before you actually are at a

83
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,320
level that you can open

84
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,199
almost any lock if you ever get to that
level and

85
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,030
even if you real good it will still take
you at least four five six months

86
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,060
of daily spending 23 hours

87
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,320
to open 50 percent of the locks within
15 minutes

88
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,620
so its it's it's not a good thing for
for broker shall

89
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,650
as always when I explain first to show
that

90
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,250
at the technique is not useful for
burglary and because there's other

91
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:10,529
other things for that novel technique
used by burglars is of course

92
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:13,570
I'm running up homie into law

93
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,760
I eliminating

94
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,880
the the the pressure

95
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,750
on a the Pens inside then you can turn
the cell under an open door as well

96
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,520
and that's again much easier to do than
actually

97
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,120
picking a lock and but we are not giving

98
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,570
perjury schools and other let's go to
the sport to rise

99
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,289
no but seriously I mean people think
been

100
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:46,610
that anything is quite secure but a it's
not it's it's so easy to get into a

101
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,360
house that

102
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,490
there are Porsche locks available on the
European market that have a protection

103
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,120
against that

104
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,199
but I will show that later on when I
come to the special

105
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,870
high-security locks little

106
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,820
yeah mmm acting I don't think we have
enough

107
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,130
focus to actually show you the binge E

108
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,199
this is about as good as you can get and
it's really a shame because dish

109
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,349
model has is completely open shawl

110
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:18,240
if you would have been close up you
could actually see all the beings and

111
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,979
what it does

112
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:22,070
me so I have to try something else

113
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:29,070
motion

114
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:37,229
and the MIT lockpicking guide as a
backup so I'll have to be gotten

115
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:44,229
by the way the MIT guy to lock picking
is available on the Internet

116
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,060
a several URL so if you just

117
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,089
go to your favorite search engine type
and I'm IT guy to lock picking

118
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:56,930
you will find it no no doubt about it in

119
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,250
in

120
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,190
be been

121
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,900
can everybody see this no

122
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,189
okay okay I'll going to text mode and

123
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:16,590
a a

124
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,689
when you have a lock it's actually a
cylinder

125
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:22,849
that moves into see

126
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:29,849
rising

127
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,120
I I'm

128
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,229
make

129
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,700
it's actually a cylinder that a

130
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,120
if the key is right can rotate

131
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,180
in the decor

132
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,180
base today's the base of the lock and
this is what we want to achieve want to

133
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,220
achieve that we can

134
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,959
rotate the inner cylinder the National a

135
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,110
inner cylinder Asha five holes drilled
in them

136
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,360
and English five holes are bins and just

137
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,540
tiny little pins and

138
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,160
when a key is inserted through deadlock
the been will be moved up

139
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,140
I'll out in moved up

140
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,870
and if the being is at the level where

141
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,990
the core of the locketts then it can

142
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:32,070
turn if it is too high it was stakeouts
an insight here is rattling all is well

143
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,820
and if it is too high it will jam and
that's the basic idea

144
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,940
that all the five beings have to be
aligned at the same height

145
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,779
where did too when it what they call the
sheer line

146
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:49,540
and when you achieve that the lock to
open if one of them is too hot too high

147
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,569
or too low

148
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,570
the being just jam be in the way

149
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,880
and cannot work I hope this is
sufficient

150
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,709
information if it's not I'm okay you're
right it's a good question

151
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:05,709
I in here are also

152
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:08,740
5 pins show actually every hole is
covered by

153
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,510
two beings and this trend and and a
spring on top of that to keep the ball

154
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,610
to keep it under under pressure and when
the

155
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,050
been is too low and higher been will

156
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,990
for into the initial under endemic like
that that's a very good question

157
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,750
thanks and now not picking how does it
work

158
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,870
and something of course the whole

159
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,399
yes at some tools most likely to be able
to

160
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,060
pick a lock and one of the tools

161
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,740
a available is of course the Nikki

162
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,870
but if you don't have to gay

163
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,500
if you don't have to key have to I am

164
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,110
I to make all by on get somewhere

165
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,010
somewhere else a tools like these there

166
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,670
a wearing it Mariners

167
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,689
and but I'm showing right now

168
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,069
is what's called the lady said or

169
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:14,550
and with the first time yeah home in

170
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,500
with Seattle tomb jackknife jack knife
set

171
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,589
basically holst a hold for tools to get
up

172
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:26,120
a.m. post the whole brought to snakes
inside

173
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,270
pressure can point to modest

174
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,560
helps us make their is a hot diamond

175
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,500
and there is a finger up butts

176
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,880
to be able to pick a lock you actually
need another tool

177
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,870
that comes with it and school the
tension wrench

178
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,110
'cause what we actually want to achieve
this

179
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,360
and turned a cylinder inside look

180
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,680
and with the tools you can manipulate
the Benton side

181
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,779
but you have to have some 1.2 a

182
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:02,640
to be able to put on pressure on it and
that's the

183
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,670
the tension wrench the funny thing is
that when you are

184
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,810
the in a movie which some people that
are lot and two ships

185
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,060
and James Bond is picking out only one
to land

186
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:18,459
putting it in the lock and turning it at
you know your body as a key

187
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:20,310
okay

188
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,850
K so you need attention and actually the
tension wrench ish

189
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,380
really important to our people
underestimated but

190
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,960
it's actually the putting the right
amount of tension on the locked it opens

191
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,260
it

192
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,380
if you put too much you will a

193
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,610
four-ship beings and I cannot move but
a.m.

194
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,589
a question be nice to me many times
already because we had a few workshop

195
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:45,810
showing the other room

196
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,130
for just for the people Makena can play
already a little bit with the locks

197
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,360
is I'm how expensive is my first set
going to be

198
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,930
should I buy immediately a much to ship
or should begin cheap

199
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,500
at the end to that they should begin
cheap at the beginning

200
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,990
you hear me very cheap okay at the
beginning

201
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,470
you will bend your tools because you
don't know how much pressure you can

202
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,170
the use on you tools and you will
definitely

203
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,010
arm them so begin its cheapest possible
and this is

204
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,819
as cheap as possible these are just a
metal plates

205
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,910
which have the shape of the of the pics
and actually they are pictured court

206
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,230
but they don't have a and all they don't
have anything

207
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,980
produced a straight piece metal me these

208
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,589
things you can buy on the on the
internet for about two dollars three

209
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:39,290
dollars

210
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,709
for per item and if you ever go to
Germany

211
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,370
december is a good day to do that
because then they reached the

212
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,560
championship but I will come back today

213
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,310
and they sell the sense they're for very
little money so

214
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:58,050
that might be a reason to go

215
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,540
I am so

216
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,189
begin cheap did this is the cheaper
solution you can get

217
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,629
a.m. it's just basic the

218
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:09,649
tools then the jack knife when the lady
said

219
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,939
is also a very cheap and Andy thing

220
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:16,199
you can carried with you at all times if
you

221
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:20,430
Dec to death in the United States a.m.

222
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,949
in Europe that's no know the real
problem and I hope that after his

223
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:24,649
workshop

224
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:29,279
it won't be in the United States because
we hope to get people motivated to start

225
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,819
a small group but as i said im go back
into

226
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:37,589
I am I just brought a few big set so I
just wanna show them

227
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:40,670
this is what is being called the KGB big
said

228
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,019
it's a set you can carry I on your
buckle

229
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:47,040
or I a bell and

230
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,389
it has very nice tools with a nice a
handles tomato

231
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:57,410
fine rubber a.m. I put some extra tools
in there as well so you

232
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,050
I didn't buy dissent as it is now a.m.

233
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:04,889
this type of tools but there for the
special high-security locks but I'll

234
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:05,689
show you later

235
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:10,420
then the most common sense on their
beginners is

236
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,579
this one just contains up to 12 pics

237
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:19,620
even as a tool nested track

238
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,250
yeah and even as a tool that can extract
broken keys from a lock

239
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,569
so if you key ever break into your lock

240
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:30,850
you can just use this type of fish home
thing and

241
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,880
tried to get behind the broken part of
the key and pull it back

242
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,120
very thing schalch also work

243
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,459
excellent for that I don't know what the
word finish mujhe

244
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,550
figure drawing some

245
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,730
its it is a very thin so

246
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,939
he coping also

247
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:56,579
up okay well that will work as well you
can just tried to get it behind

248
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:59,649
the key and now you can pointed out

249
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:03,920
I a lot of people had grade using that
because if you call a locksmith

250
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,009
to and say will make you broken then
they will rebound your entire door and

251
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,339
make a bloody mess and show you all new
door and locks and

252
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:15,839
and before you know it you spend like a

253
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,180
three hundred dollars well the only
thing you need to just a little

254
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,730
saw you put it in get it back

255
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,790
and don't don't call Locksmith when you
have problems with opening your door

256
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,589
because

257
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:31,000
they will make a mess I mean first tried
to be clever yourself

258
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and anyway is the beginner asset and its
cost about

259
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
its 30-35 bucks you can get it

260
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,860
and you can have a a great deal of fun
with the set

261
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,089
being then

262
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,370
more the expensive said as

263
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,740
just more tools everything this one

264
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,139
its also not completed used to have all
set

265
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:59,439
a used to have like fifty or sixty

266
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:02,750
of the same identical picture it doesn't
make a difference

267
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,130
but it's more cheap to buy it and by

268
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,500
three or four the sets and if you think
that you are getting somewhere it might

269
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,890
be useful to buy to

270
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,189
I'm a really good set to buy

271
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:18,789
an ass watch bball the dental big set

272
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:23,470
and that is this and I really thought I
was gonna get in trouble with customs

273
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,339
and bringing it in because it's really
is a stainless steel

274
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,520
sharp dart that cases

275
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,809
deviation and lookin snake

276
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:38,250
meh a good is one i mean it's really

277
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,659
really nasty and sharp but a.m.

278
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:44,700
these things are really the best because
they

279
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,200
have an excellent the feel next 100

280
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,890
and if you are an experienced banker

281
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:56,190
you'll find these very very nice and I i
have a great

282
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,440
do the fun with them although I always
use my small okay to be sad because you

283
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,669
always have that on me

284
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:08,210
shall this is more for a championship

285
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,840
going to join them thing

286
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,869
and then you have the relax pressure and
it has

287
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:19,678
the it mostly used for by

288
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,210
the the intelligence community he'll
really

289
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,210
it's made by someone called follow

290
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,440
and his company is also called columns
follow

291
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,539
picture and actually they

292
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,729
look quite cheap and I think even

293
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:39,729
to make them they are but they have an
excellent

294
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:44,840
group an excellent design mean one-sided
the

295
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,178
of the big is very thin any other side
you have a little bit more grip

296
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:52,840
but what's very nice about this is the
way did you

297
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,999
can use them you can you should like Ben

298
00:18:55,999 --> 00:19:00,609
each really has a nice grip she

299
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:06,210
I only use one or two of these

300
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,369
pics the more and more finger shaped the

301
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:14,899
big because all the rest is only for
real special locks

302
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:19,220
but it's it's a nice feeling it's really
nice lock and also the

303
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,749
tension ranchers are really special and
I don't know if I can

304
00:19:22,749 --> 00:19:29,129
show it to you with the camera because
but this one actually

305
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:33,090
and can move you can change the size

306
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,678
of the of the pensioner and you can

307
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:39,799
make it fit in in a lot perfectly by

308
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:44,029
too shy to having more agreed on the law
and

309
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:47,570
it to fit in almost any lock and data

310
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,739
like five different types of they'd ever

311
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:55,220
for for every lock to have something and
it really gives a nice

312
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,950
tension feel an itch is really special
this is the most expensive said

313
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,109
I have that's costing about 350 bucks

314
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:09,499
they are I knew it

315
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:14,159
me so that's the tools but

316
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,879
when you're starting just by the simple
big set for 35 bucks or even

317
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:22,320
by a few extra these cheaper two-dollar

318
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,639
one blade pics because that's all you're
going to use at the beginning

319
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:30,389
in mmm okay let's

320
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:33,399
show them how it works okay show them
how it works

321
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,739
at the Sports Group we have one famous
lock

322
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:40,840
and it's the brand name each a 909

323
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,849
and I don't think I can show it to you
but actually

324
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:48,580
its is here 909 and look is very famous

325
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,309
in this for groups in Germany and
Holland and why because its very easy to

326
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:54,029
pick

327
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:58,879
you just board anything in there move it
a little bit and it will open

328
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:04,279
here I'm so I bet you that now under
pressure I can't open it but

329
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:07,460
she usually I this lock is

330
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,700
no thanks the this lock

331
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,320
a is used as a motivation to show people
that

332
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,460
you can open a lock and to show them how
it's done

333
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,480
and get you at to give you the feeling

334
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,149
of what you are doing and show 1 I'll
try to do it I'll

335
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:27,720
but attention in the lock and an upward

336
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,639
attention on it and it won't open
because the beings are in the way

337
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:38,639
net asset and I KTP picture

338
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:46,419
me

339
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:50,410
my way the to I use most is just a
broken off

340
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,110
two-dollar pic which I

341
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:58,080
the ground on just a little bit sad to
make it a little more thing

342
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,490
polish it a little bit because when its
meaning

343
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,679
it gives a better action and it's also
one of the first things we teach people

344
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,400
at the club

345
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,000
he's too take buried in sand paper and

346
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,440
brush on the edges of the picture and it
will really

347
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,299
improve the way K

348
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:21,879
now this is the fingers I'm going to
live been taught by Triton

349
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,659
a funk

350
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:33,570
way

351
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:37,510
okay but I can promise you anyone in
this audience can do this lock

352
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,610
a in under under three minutes if they
don't

353
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,630
put extremely attention on it

354
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,720
because if you really push it then you
cannot push the pins

355
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,690
up because you're jamming yourself and
that's what his luck is all about its to

356
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,549
teach you

357
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:56,240
not to use too much force which is to
begin our also when

358
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,250
lifting the beings sometimes people
break

359
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,330
tools by putting too much pressure
because the pushing too hard on a

360
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,220
tensioner

361
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,419
a.m. begin shop minutes she

362
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:12,980
that airs at two different techniques to
to pick a lock

363
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,480
and basic technique we teach be but the
club is the raking

364
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,710
technique you have got this tool for
that and you she did it's not straight

365
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,570
it has shown up

366
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,129
the shape of of maybe you could choose

367
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:30,120
snake or and an idiot

368
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,679
what you do is you go over the beings

369
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,179
whited you just hid them and

370
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:40,400
block open a.m.

371
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,980
this works with the great the love locks
the

372
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,210
but only when the

373
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,090
beings in the lock are about the same
high

374
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,260
when there's a big difference in height
when the first fini said these large and

375
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,930
the second being is very small

376
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,890
this is I'm and not such a good
technique to do that

377
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,620
then you really need one of the
so-called lifters our fingers

378
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,210
to going to lock and pushed binge one by
one

379
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,570
setting them and well it still a

380
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,450
and eyesight technique to start with a
lot because

381
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,110
I using raking you can actually make

382
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,200
so I'm not turn just a little bit so
that

383
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,410
bill not gem on all bands but only on a
few bands

384
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:29,800
and once you're have the summer and
autumn just a little bit

385
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,980
you can focus on those pins but I'll
actually blocking the Sun

386
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,960
at that time so it's a about it
techniques to start wit

387
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,350
don't finish it off with

388
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:46,290
actually picking a lock well you don't
think the game is played first I missed

389
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:50,000
lifting them and that's just going into
the lock fining

390
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,780
been jamming the most because as five
pins and avid one ish always a little

391
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,610
bit thicker

392
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:59,170
and the other one so if you put pressure
on the law

393
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:03,880
and long a jam won all five being too
cool jam on one or two beings

394
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,360
and the trick with lifting its is
finding that been

395
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,640
and if you move up you don't feel any
pressure

396
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,020
then bin is completely loose and you
don't have any

397
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,460
a and do not have any problem okay

398
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,080
did it again a.m. but this is an

399
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,290
very easy lock there's also is a very
similar

400
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:31,500
I'll and but he said the two basic
techniques

401
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,930
that you can use to open a lock with
would like picking

402
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:38,870
and she

403
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:43,220
much next there is a Porsche

404
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,900
a more than just these this type of
market there are many many many locks

405
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,470
and the thing is that almost every lock
has its toll

406
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:57,140
and this is a tool that can be used on I
don't know 75 percent on all the locks

407
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,580
on

408
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,820
a but of course there is also a special

409
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,649
locks in special tools like the Jupiler
II

410
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:09,640
crash locks have many many many but
every luck message to all and when you

411
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,230
look on the internet you can find a lot
of tools for a lot of locks

412
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,730
but this is the most common thing and

413
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,820
lifting ish a is really solving the
puzzle raking is just

414
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,919
trying your luck and it's not really
solving a puzzle

415
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,830
guess it's not such easy like national I
am

416
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,899
but this is really solving the puzzle
going one by one

417
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,460
feeling the pinch and also when you've
had been

418
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:41,060
detention sometimes comes back to you
saying that okay this is the one

419
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:48,060
that is where the forces on nah she can
see you can actually do

420
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:53,639
this this port while talking to an
audience of talking to a lot of people

421
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,130
in the room so it's a social event
really it is

422
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:03,580
wanted we want to make it as social as
possible so yet

423
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,840
you can have a beer yet if you do smoke
you can have

424
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,560
a cigarette if you really need to a

425
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,149
and in the meantime solve a puzzle and
and talk with it

426
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,170
and the guys and girls over on

427
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:21,310
on the table and exchange information on
on different kind of luck

428
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:25,139
princeton's once you pick a lock and you
know

429
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,179
really know how to lock works you can
exchange that information went

430
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:34,470
some other guy who as a.m. extreme
difficulties in thinking that lock

431
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:38,150
like me I

432
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,390
right now okay a.m.

433
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:46,200
but you get the idea I'll and also when

434
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,260
placing the attention it's also
important the

435
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:54,250
when I assume that the that the bins are
here and there and I part of the lock

436
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:59,179
I'm some people prefer to put attention
on the low side of the lock

437
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:02,460
and then you pick it and

438
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,150
I prefer to put it on the high side
because we put it on the high side of

439
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:06,740
the law

440
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,790
the you have extra space to move

441
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,980
your tool song that's what I prefer

442
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,200
to know what's

443
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,120
with some locks you have to a put
attention are

444
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,140
and in the middle of on the high side of
it along because

445
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,700
the I the space where

446
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,770
where the key normally fits and so small
that

447
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:34,200
if you do it any other way you calmed
I'm

448
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,780
and surgical tools and into lock so I
got it

449
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,629
pink its

450
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:48,630
and of course the look industry is not
crazy as well

451
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,770
showed a think of all these things all
the time to make life

452
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,410
for the lot because a little bit
difficult much really two men did you

453
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:07,410
can focus on that lot because put it on

454
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:16,589
thing

455
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:25,230
actually what what they do is day design
looks that have a very very very narrow

456
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,240
a entrench of the of the key and he also
has a lot of

457
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,600
side cuts as you can she here so

458
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,800
what you get is from short of zigzag the

459
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,890
a.m. loom profile

460
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:44,170
on the lock and with this locketts
almost impossible to get your tooling

461
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:48,380
because it's completely zig-zagged tryin

462
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,240
small yeah now but I mean it

463
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,980
it is possible but it's really annoying

464
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,400
show a not not every lock it's that easy

465
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,800
and if you spend a little bit more than
normal long locks

466
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,300
you you can get something something good

467
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,310
I'm well then

468
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,649
I can go to why we or what why we the

469
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:17,120
made this for group because that's
that's an interesting question

470
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,990
when I started like picking twelve years
ago I watched the only one in my group

471
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,050
anyone in my group that's not try to
force

472
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:28,270
I was the only one a in my group of
friends

473
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,830
that was interested in like picking
dress was doing computers and

474
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,250
a from the Texas for all and other
internet providers but

475
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:40,280
I was more into lockpicking and I was
sure to a loner in that

476
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,860
area and I had to teach myself
everything I ordered the picture

477
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:48,610
had no clue when I would work and my
English was not so good

478
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:53,270
a.m. so I was translating the books and
not getting it then

479
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:58,410
finally getting somewhere and I'm but it
never was a social event for me it was

480
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,310
just a struggle to learn myself

481
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:03,540
and but I finally got somewhere

482
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,940
and I did a workshop on if now on

483
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:13,430
nannies in 1993 and I think some German
guy shot at

484
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,890
and became very enthusiastic and thought
well

485
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:20,420
this is fun we want to do this as well
but in Germany

486
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:26,290
the police's streak and I mean they are
very strict maybe even more strict than

487
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:26,860
here

488
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:32,060
although in some cases that maybe not
possible but

489
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,350
know what I mean they are and one of the
things that they

490
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,820
one of their weapons of the police's the
organized crime laws

491
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,629
so if I teach you how to open a lock and
you break into a house

492
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,540
I thought you that so I'm part of your
organized crime

493
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,960
ring and urged it really is a is a big
problem

494
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,550
show they thought of something funny
they said well you know what

495
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:58,010
the let's make a a support group

496
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:01,290
the question the basic idea I guess to

497
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:05,570
to start that and it turned out to have
500 members and championships and

498
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,450
everything

499
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:10,030
that's really nice should really a went
on a good level

500
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:14,510
and day inspired a guy in all intimate
jewish

501
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,750
was the founder of the Dutch or group

502
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:22,900
to start a Dutch porn tube as well and
that's really good and

503
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,790
but show in at first thing started with
the support group for

504
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:30,950
the legal the legal problems

505
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,690
when you and to the support group in
Germany

506
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:39,250
also in Holland now you get a very nice
identity card saying

507
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,610
this version is parked for group and is
Keisha

508
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:45,900
is allowed to carry his or a gear

509
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,020
with him at all times and he signed a
contract

510
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,760
not to use the information for criminal
activities and if he does

511
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,470
police tell us and we will keep him out
of our a groom

512
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:02,100
because that's not the meaning of the
group so starting a pic group

513
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,390
is protecting yourself from trouble
because if you

514
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,220
are with five people and one of the five
people is teaching someone else to

515
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,210
stealing a bike

516
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:15,060
you are still in trouble so it is a way
to protect yourself and also if you make

517
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,330
the identity card a little bit official
put a stamp on it and

518
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:23,080
someone to things like a number and a

519
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,679
I know my bra cups cups love it I mean a

520
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:35,320
whack

521
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,168
also we put in three languages and
dispersion blah blah blah

522
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:42,500
so even if they can see it in their own
languages like wow I really thought

523
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,690
about russia

524
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,960
a with those yes

525
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,730
we still have to cover German done now

526
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:55,070
but that that's the way they did in
Germany and it'd really worked out well

527
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,310
and before I knew it they had five
hundred

528
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:00,928
and to shift that members I and also one
of the

529
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:04,590
weapons of the sport coupe in Germany
wash humor they

530
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:08,010
had they have a lot of humor in Germany
although you normally wouldn't say that

531
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:08,359
but

532
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:12,270
that the people I know the people I know
do and really there

533
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:16,770
really good people for instance a they
have several a pic

534
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:20,830
a claw such and one of them is
lockpicking in the nude

535
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:24,429
a Tony go outside they go

536
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:28,330
all the clothes then sit on a table and
big blocs and I mean I kid you not this

537
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,569
is really happening

538
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,220
who they are

539
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,240
definitely women at that meeting yes
yeah

540
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,540
even some Dutch

541
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,820
here I

542
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,040
their warehouse likely that they also
have

543
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,980
a a

544
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,090
they have pictures on on their website
of lock picking on the water

545
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,610
a few of these people are diving

546
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:58,880
and diving enthusiasts so they just made
a few pictures with

547
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,910
people in gear wearing at the Washington
masks and

548
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:08,000
picking locks at the Caribbean at
fifteen minutes of that

549
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,450
and but I mean when when when your cup
and you try to arrest

550
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:16,049
these people that are really annoying
for them because they reveal

551
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:19,490
secrets are also russian short of of
mall technique

552
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:23,310
hecker we r a because many people
believe that large

553
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,870
are secure and then you come to the to
the club for you she

554
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:30,259
bball fifteen-year-olds but that open

555
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:34,710
and its they they they don't like it but
there's so much humor in that

556
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:39,270
that you know it imagine yourself going
to court and they have a copy of the

557
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,860
website and as a well this is criminal
organization

558
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,320
and then you should be judged a new
bball picking locks

559
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:51,000
a and not picking on the water I mean it
just

560
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,270
okay that's that's that's thought about

561
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:57,420
really well and I really must the down
today yeah

562
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,450
II like what they do and it did a great
job and

563
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,799
it got me interested in lock picking
again because as i said i

564
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,480
started the a long while ago and at one
moment was just satisfied like okay I

565
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,630
know when I have to know

566
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,760
and there's no motivation in and then I
came to the first a

567
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,070
a small group of the the first evening
on the spar Group

568
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,450
because I'm not the Met Your wish
personally and

569
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,700
a.m. he said well there's lock you know
I never was able to open it

570
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:30,010
like really and I stop trying and trying
and trying in 15 minutes late and

571
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:30,930
whoppers open

572
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,230
I don't like okay I can still do this
and

573
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,960
got motivated again but some more tools
and I'm actually

574
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,820
more lockpicking than I was before doing
other stuff as well

575
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,090
but it's it's nice and also

576
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:49,630
I it keeps your mind off things you can
just sit there with the lock and forget

577
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,430
everything around you and just do it

578
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:55,089
like sitting in an airplane a no

579
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:58,730
really I mean are even people

580
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:02,240
who I have a lock all the time with them

581
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,920
and France's in a car and if

582
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,110
the lightest turned red they just picked
the lock up

583
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,480
tools try to pick it before light goes
green

584
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,490
of the one behind them goers I'll press
and the whole

585
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:23,050
and if he if he succeeds he wins the
game if he does and he loses that

586
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:26,300
its it's a way of life or and sell yet

587
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:31,230
but I mean this is actually examples of
real people that are really eager to

588
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:31,950
become

589
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:35,690
Deutscher Meister a champion in a
champion of Germany

590
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,920
which is in in in December from here

591
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,420
well Dutch maestro want right now sends

592
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,450
a the Germans are the only ones who
actually have a competition

593
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:51,620
and it will marshall so if you want to
catch up

594
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,799
you have to start your own
organisation's over here in the united

595
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,650
states as well

596
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,820
and then we can actually compete against
the each other or

597
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:03,810
a on what level a at sea

598
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:07,370
Morales I think okay a question

599
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:10,990
bunny a.m.

600
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,540
well that's that's different the dish
for groom

601
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,860
focuses on on been bombers and funny
locks

602
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,460
of course also combination locks but
there is so many different types of

603
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,220
combination locks and some work to just
put a little tension on the lock you

604
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:26,870
boil it

605
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:30,609
and then you try to die and to try to
dial and

606
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,110
when the dish determine only distinction
there

607
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:37,260
when a dish polling place you will feel
a little dick

608
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,280
that one of the techniques to open the
lock but the scoresheet

609
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,090
some of them are protected against that
but that's an an old different day

610
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:47,280
game this mortgage normally focus on

611
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,760
just normal lockstep that you will find
almost everywhere

612
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,810
competition

613
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:57,220
Milwaukee homes yet why

614
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:01,690
okay I have not enter the competition
but what I know of it is that when you

615
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,310
want to enter the competition

616
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,330
you bring one lock yourself I am

617
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:10,779
so you are at the table would say 15
people and clock starch

618
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,820
you have to pick your lock within five
minutes yourself

619
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,490
if you cannot pick you look if I manage
a shell you

620
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,540
move a.m. then when you do that you

621
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,750
shift the Lac du your neighbor and you
get another lock

622
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,830
and you get maximum 15 minutes for
deadlock

623
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:30,120
and as I understand it work by the way
for a nomination

624
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:35,480
shoulders one winner the also I think
it's from something with diamond points

625
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,910
and a write down how fast you do it and
often

626
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:42,870
again made the opened in

627
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:46,980
applied no could I

628
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,760
wank

629
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,320
the most difficult look to open yet

630
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,800
I N well the more difficult not to open

631
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,590
then you assume that you can open it in
the first place okay

632
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:08,680
I am when the most difficult locks I
won't go into that later

633
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,190
but they look a little bit like the key
looking a bit like

634
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:16,190
this I don't know if you can see you and
it all these

635
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:19,380
also in they they used to call them

636
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,170
computer keys on on a wide just a sales
argument only but

637
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:27,990
and I'm and and the really nice and
interesting

638
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:32,060
many many polls in key instead of
playing

639
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,220
coach another only holes on the side but
also

640
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:41,120
a yeah right top come on sites in

641
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:45,060
he the region indeed I checked a

642
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,500
K wells nothing wrong with that per head
coach I would say

643
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,650
a go to your mobile I

644
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:55,170
S&M shop and time I'm serious

645
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:59,529
hey they sell you they sell you a key
there for one dollar 99

646
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:02,680
that were open all the norm or and gosh
around

647
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,749
and I serious and I know people that

648
00:41:05,749 --> 00:41:10,109
the bought a bunch of dollars and shot
them in that close only have one in the

649
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:12,098
neck and one in the back of the bands

650
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:15,759
a and I'm not kidding I mean this is for
real

651
00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:19,839
I okayed nice

652
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,808
okay shouldn't be questioned yeah K I'll

653
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:30,809
up

654
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:41,699
here okay did did anyone hear that
question because I understand that

655
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:45,079
day yeah okay I

656
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:48,229
I think that the manufactures on the
lock

657
00:41:48,229 --> 00:41:51,269
know how to make a save lock problem
instead

658
00:41:51,269 --> 00:41:55,739
if they go by the rules and really make
it safe the fuck is going to be five

659
00:41:55,739 --> 00:41:58,059
dollars more expensive than the
competition

660
00:41:58,059 --> 00:42:02,199
and the person buying the lock cannot
see the difference between

661
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:05,670
a ten dollar fifteen dollar twenty
dollars thirty five dollar mark

662
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:09,929
because sometimes even depend on lock is
better than 35 show

663
00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:14,380
but it's it's difficult and there are
some rules like

664
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,900
closing that that that to get where you
can put in your tools

665
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,549
by putting his exact motive that that's
a very effective way

666
00:42:21,549 --> 00:42:25,170
of I'll of preventing from from

667
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:30,609
lockpicking a.m. that also I always like
putting magnets

668
00:42:30,609 --> 00:42:34,609
you lock I have a whole bunch of
Magnitsky's with me and I don't know

669
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:37,640
if we get to the point that I can
actually show

670
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,009
some of the MEK MEK MEK large but I
cannot open don't make me magnetic locks

671
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:46,039
it would require special tools and and

672
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:49,329
I have an idea on how to open them and
it's also I think it had been done

673
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:49,969
before

674
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:54,630
using people

675
00:42:54,630 --> 00:43:01,630
realize up

676
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:06,839
sure a in in all in germany you see more
often

677
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:10,019
articles in newspapers on this crazy or
group

678
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:13,880
and I think even in Germany the some of
the

679
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,479
television even got got the I

680
00:43:17,479 --> 00:43:20,650
got typed on television unpopular shosh

681
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:26,049
so many many people she what's going on
in 15 year old room to begin opening

682
00:43:26,049 --> 00:43:29,489
I locks that they can that they have on
their own or

683
00:43:29,489 --> 00:43:35,019
show now it is working and may be too
big boost for the lock industry to

684
00:43:35,019 --> 00:43:39,410
to make a locks and also I think that in
Germany but I I'm not sure

685
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,899
I am the guys from the small group are

686
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,999
docking went manufacturers have locks

687
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:49,329
and even trying to open locks today

688
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:52,929
gonna bring out and everything but I'm
not a hundred percent sure on

689
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:56,289
checking into details but there are some
people actually from Germany year

690
00:43:56,289 --> 00:44:01,839
added might know the answer to that but
in Holland we're not at that point yet

691
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:08,839
next

692
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,160
correct

693
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,799
yeah the average per game will kick your
door down and I and our and a

694
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,680
screwdriver then again computer hacking
is not about breaking and entering

695
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,819
a a website isn't that

696
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:33,390
thats cracking

697
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:34,370
okay anyway

698
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:37,900
and

699
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:44,900
my question

700
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:48,799
close observation

701
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,980
good

702
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,160
I am

703
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:00,020
yes make additional but you have
anything it

704
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,180
I'm I'm left handed so and I sent

705
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,919
now so you can a and the other thing is
because I

706
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,360
trained myself in lock picking and I
have no one to show me

707
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:15,720
I had I ever wrong technique no really I
mean if you really really really want to

708
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,630
look back you gotta do it like this

709
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:21,410
this is the right way to do it holding
that pic like Ben

710
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:24,799
and making this motion but I

711
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,680
train myself in doing this and it also
works but if you really

712
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,669
want to become an expert lot bigger
learned is a grip because this is really

713
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,280
the way

714
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,700
to do it and all the people that win
that the championship

715
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,860
a I see them picking like this because
thats

716
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:46,860
the best way to do it like writing in
all in a band

717
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:54,020
yes that's true problem I I can show you
a little

718
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,530
tool because sometimes the to curve

719
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:00,760
of of order shape of the

720
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,030
the shape of the key

721
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:08,290
will prevent you from picking into left
to right because you just won't fit or

722
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:08,830
just

723
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:11,940
doesn't work and you can be went with
some difficult

724
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:16,200
a key types you can be lucky to

725
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,350
big the lock on the left but you need to
go to write should it's a problem

726
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:23,750
I fortunately lot big companies

727
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:26,810
design something for nothing and that's
this little

728
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:30,020
device and it's called the of lipid

729
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,460
I N what you do is you

730
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,720
bring it under pressure you putting a
lock

731
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,800
I i don't know if you should I turned
into shooting

732
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,130
you doing it and lock and you push it
and it really fast with a spring

733
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:47,450
don't block now I when I started

734
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:52,000
lockpicking I I of course thought of
while a device like that would be nice

735
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,020
but I didn't thought it would exist
because it would turn to slow

736
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:00,330
but in fact it doesn't it really works
and I'm

737
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:04,170
that's a little bit difficult normally I
have something to hold the lock

738
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:07,940
in the neck and demonstrated and as you
can see the look is now

739
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:12,190
location management

740
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:16,260
no not we'll just only read that the
lock a little bit the

741
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:21,010
don't p.m. if I sound came home okay
I'll

742
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:24,970
way okay Anne

743
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:28,130
okay I hope you can see that the markets
now don't like that

744
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:31,880
and I want to turn to lurk the

745
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:37,390
that way so that means okay

746
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:41,230
the the

747
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:44,880
ago it rotated the lock

748
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,380
very fast and

749
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:52,140
that's about it and just a a forty
dollar to

750
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,609
but if you United really is worth the
money

751
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:59,740
if you are here

752
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:03,650
only losses Wong

753
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:08,510
was a question to like would

754
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:12,680
a I didn't find any lock not even the
high-security 15

755
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,680
been locks that it doesn't work really

756
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,870
rotates the lock fast and is really good

757
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:24,230
doesn't open it did did

758
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:27,560
long here turning why you don't have to
be yet

759
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,090
just rotated rock

760
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:34,390
thanks Rob the

761
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:37,890
okay I am

762
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:41,470
also somebody was talking about going to
look big industry

763
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:44,520
designed to save lock of course they try

764
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,750
sometimes and they come out with

765
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:51,230
a things that people when they see the
thing while

766
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:56,430
edition cool are I'm going to put it in
my door and a they decide something

767
00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:01,259
to prevent people just kicking in the
door or prying out the lock because

768
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,530
you know I settled with the screw in and
you can just rip the lockout

769
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:07,970
sheathing a big he signed a

770
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:10,980
law that completely

771
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,940
moves into your door so you don't see
any updates on the outside did you see a

772
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:15,990
small

773
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:19,520
in your door and his long key we'd

774
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,700
three sides four sites I

775
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,980
will fit in and turn the lock

776
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:29,150
well unfortunately this is not the

777
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:32,420
right key for the lock which is just not
a key for

778
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:36,220
this type of lock but I have a tool to
open it so

779
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,090
if you want I can demonstrate it to you
had

780
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:47,090
okay

781
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:47,799
this

782
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,010
tool is a a whole

783
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:58,010
by C

784
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:02,490
anyway despite this hollow and it has
four little

785
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:06,520
the not use on it for that work in the

786
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,490
what I have in my hand here ish the
tensioner all I put tensioner on the

787
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:10,990
lock

788
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:14,200
from normally that would be a hole in
the door and this would be all the way

789
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,170
in the door

790
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,850
and this is where the key normally and a
show I put

791
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:22,819
the device in and Prevention on the lock
now

792
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:26,160
there's another device with four little
a

793
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,790
raking tools and if you can see that
look scary

794
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:35,630
I'm mmm

795
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:41,050
being been

796
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:48,050
be

797
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:56,010
just banging on that they belong

798
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:03,060
being

799
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:15,440
week

800
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:23,530
big bang

801
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:36,740
well going

802
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:45,510
am

803
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:48,710
in

804
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:51,930
never said it was easy nation yeah I

805
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:58,930
as you can see it's a pretty good
looking it's not being

806
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:05,970
I'm and they need to adjust the
settlement

807
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:11,640
anyway this is a handmade picture and
their altruism

808
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:17,060
official version it you can buy from HPC
thus a little better job and

809
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,980
but its very expensive it's like to not
fifty dollars

810
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:25,560
on the other hand the his luck has been
used in poland

811
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:30,890
almost every door as an extra-long may
have one or more your ocean in the long

812
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:33,970
and many people use this and they're
extra lock

813
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:37,420
russians completely in the door and

814
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,730
for a junkie with a crowbar is very easy
to get the

815
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:44,600
the to get to it the

816
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,110
being

817
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:53,770
I don't think the back door yeah a

818
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:57,820
yeah well demonstration effect in person

819
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:01,930
workprint maybe homes can talk to you
and i cant

820
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:05,200
keep trying I can talk to them

821
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:12,200
a the sea knows that we had yes you up

822
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:25,150

right up a tool up

825
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:45,970
too low as it seems only because yep

826
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:00,380
well most of the time you can a whole
metal piece aside by

827
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:07,380
just using I'm your tension wrench up

828
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,470
who dey and well

829
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:17,130
you you play you apply too much pressure
most likely

830
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:20,150
and these kinda looks

831
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:23,420
the %ah cultural and yeah you can pick
them

832
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:27,510
a sorry from the camping

833
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:30,850
a Laurent the the site

834
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:35,009
right I am yeah you can pick them

835
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:38,460
and are even special sets a

836
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,920
available a to make life even easier

837
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:48,870
I'm not too hot ahead

838
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:55,850
now does no fundamental difference yeah
absolutely

839
00:54:55,850 --> 00:55:00,589
thing

840
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:03,710
I don't have any experience with mondaq
magnetic

841
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:09,760
locks up

842
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,250
all nope

843
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:16,590
a.m. what we're just

844
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:20,820
looking into that one a in

845
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:25,090
you need you need special tools at least
special tools to be able to pick a lot

846
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:25,760
like that

847
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,840
and there are some very ingenious locks

848
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,140
available using magnets and

849
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:39,049
I guess we brought some of them over you
guys up

850
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:42,250
Nick me

851
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:47,260
that would be part of not taking knowing

852
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:52,230
now I gotta I got yep yes yes

853
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:55,320
we don't the you have if you want a ride
down there

854
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,930
to links you must visit then there's
lockpicking .nl

855
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:02,730
lockpicking don't or an orchestra your
because they were the first

856
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:05,840
became

857
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,560
yep me

858
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,960
said

859
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,440
know it's 10 it's five on the bottom
five on the dot

860
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,300
shop

861
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,820
the chamber chamber unique

862
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:29,730
it's only two yeah well you can have
more than two

863
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:32,850
but a the only a

864
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:36,980
same indeed yeah you can have a master
key at that time

865
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,350
and no

866
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:43,690
not the you can't make one yourself if
you want to that

867
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:50,340
best hip

868
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,470
in I'm gonna tools but

869
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:56,490
good including

870
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:59,810
no I didn't bring the jeweler big with
me doom

871
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:03,320
so many stuffed up we have to come
through customs

872
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:08,860
long

873
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:12,260
now to the BBQ half order to Miller is

874
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:15,800
a itself setting two more and it's
really smart

875
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,270
design what you do because you can see
all the

876
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:23,600
beings on a tour a lock and wanted to
lease is nothing more than

877
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:27,380
a blinky with five or seven

878
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,570
bins that are exactly aligned on the

879
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:35,290
on been to the lock and as a rubber band
which will prevent the five pins from

880
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:37,820
sliding back but if you put enough
pressure on it

881
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:41,160
they will the the bins on the law will

882
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,210
slide the bins on your pic back

883
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:47,990
until the point where the actual news to
share line

884
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:51,450
so what you do is you think the the
picture

885
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:55,080
you align it 2-0 to reboot although
beings down on the set

886
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,930
you put it on the lot and then you
wiggle and well weakling

887
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:03,620
the beings on the law will push tool
into the right position

888
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,950
and it will open and when is open you
even have

889
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:11,450
a key to deadlock and is really one of
the smartest

890
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:15,970
pick tools ever invented and it's been
getting bring it because it also Asian

891
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:17,910
nation demonstration but

892
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:21,600
there's so much more stuff that

893
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,730
its more popular now

894
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:29,500
a expensive like a to under fifty
dollars 300

895
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,640
I now

896
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,279
its it's only a tool so you can use
multi-ethnic

897
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,000
the thing with that in mind though that
you can teach your monkey how to operate

898
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,290
it because you only have to put it on

899
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:44,620
du Lac we go it and in the lot will open
its really

900
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:51,009
really simple a

901
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:54,600
their shit technique called impression
in and

902
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:59,090
I'm not the really going into debt today
we could do that some other time

903
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:02,100
but it's really a fun technique where

904
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:05,930
you take a blank I don't know if you
know the blanket blankets a key

905
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:09,270
would know gotten it yet the way that
you have it in in in in the

906
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:13,640
keystore a.m. and what you do is with
file

907
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:18,710
you find it extremely thin especially
dole you make it very thin like a razor

908
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:22,020
and you put it in the locked with a
special grip

909
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:25,050
show you can put attention on it if we
sit in the lock

910
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:28,680
and then you start making pressure on it

911
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,970
and moving it up and down now what will
happen is that

912
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:35,690
been that jamming the most will make an
impression in that

913
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:40,200
very thin piece of metal of the blankie
to take a filing

914
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,570
you take a a little bit of you go back
in again and

915
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:47,540
do it again and then the used to get
another mark

916
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,610
and you take a little bit of their and

917
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:54,060
they go get it very time consuming

918
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:57,090
thing but it's really a nice method of

919
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:01,620
making a key to unlock that even you may
not have ever seen that key

920
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:05,420
but you can still create a just making
at Lucky

921
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:12,420
and is really nice technique yep

922
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:16,380
and a master key

923
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:19,770
a if you can open a lot with a master
key a

924
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:23,700
there are more than two pins in each
hole a

925
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:27,370
so its that's not the key itself the
more

926
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:31,790
dole auction are a.m. modified in such a
way

927
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:36,350
that the march turkey can open all locks
and they have a special

928
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:40,380
a.m. key for each locus well more

929
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:43,840
one position yeah that will open the
lock

930
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,450
although Paul allow you to rotate them

931
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:51,790
yes might be late

932
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:54,800
okay I gotta

933
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:59,490
yet skates

934
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,860
with his lock you have to pick the lock
twice because a Goshen

935
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:06,980
two steps the it also would lock picking
if it doesn't work

936
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:11,710
just Thank You dime take a little break
forget about you can be friends again

937
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:15,370
go on forever but then you will never
going to get the lock open just

938
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:18,839
bigger take a little break n

939
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:23,240
sends and even what would we be doing
the shopping should just get a

940
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,270
modification Law

941
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:27,950
like the 909 opened at three times in GI
I know I can do it

942
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:31,290
and a in

943
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:38,290
okay the turner up

944
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:46,650
week the known but normally with some
common sense you think if I have a key

945
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:47,900
then I would probably

946
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:51,060
dude is than that most of the time it's
that yeah

947
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:58,060
and otherwise you know by afflicted make

948
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:02,600
now but I mean when you're picking the
lock ubiquitin wrong way

949
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,920
that's okay because you still have the
lockpick should be used to flip it

950
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,890
tho and you just putting the flip it

951
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:15,589
and then the flip it will turn it for
you so if you picked it to the right

952
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:21,780
you entered a plea bit and flip it will
fly to left

953
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,630
him

954
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:30,630
at this that's what I still in the back

955
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:36,069
sure yes I am

956
01:02:36,069 --> 01:02:43,069
okay I

957
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:47,739
not really no no no a if you have so
much

958
01:02:47,739 --> 01:02:54,739
hearing

959
01:02:55,099 --> 01:02:59,679
a well you could contact the Dutch or
German group

960
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:04,769
a if you want to start to a support
group for yourself and maybe even a

961
01:03:04,769 --> 01:03:05,859
range that you can buy

962
01:03:05,859 --> 01:03:09,199
the tools there or they can get you
started on tools or

963
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:12,689
may be on the identity card or whatever
a.m.

964
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:15,849
but the people that are in these groups
are the

965
01:03:15,849 --> 01:03:20,039
friendly people that are willing to help
and they would find it a thrill

966
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:23,250
if sport group would come out in

967
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:26,150
in the States and that we can have the
real

968
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:29,520
championship games and not just in
German championship but

969
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:35,380
the world games and maybe some Asian
group as well he's amazing people in a

970
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:35,980
room in

971
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:40,050
you know make a global would be fun in

972
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:43,250
in I'll loss

973
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:47,790
have cylinder shake by

974
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:51,070
that's a completely different markets
called ABLOY

975
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:54,320
and a spic sets for dat a

976
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,580
books that's not something I'm going to
discuss now but

977
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:01,680
they also use them here on vending
machines in Bay financial corruption

978
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,500
employs

979
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:06,680
around here a little bit it's just that
it has in an half open

980
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:10,190
shaped like a half moon or something a
sticky

981
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:16,990
yeah

982
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:21,210
I set

983
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:24,920
and I don't know that dead

984
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,339
yep

985
01:04:28,339 --> 01:04:32,599
okay well then you can much opened with
a key writing

986
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:37,289
now okay I'm I think I will demonstrate
a few more

987
01:04:37,289 --> 01:04:40,700
difficult to big lock short least which
claim to be

988
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:44,250
difficulty or strange I am

989
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:49,349
I will show you something

990
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:54,609
I clipping

991
01:04:54,609 --> 01:04:57,700
okay so we learned that the normal locks
have

992
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,990
normally 5 pins or at least five sets of
two pins

993
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:05,150
but we just call that a five pin lock
because the

994
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:09,260
things that you can touch r5 bins and
that's the five pins that you going to

995
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:09,700
set

996
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:14,760
I in Europe they started a long time ago
with the so-called

997
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:19,010
computer keys or he said have many many

998
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:25,480
Olson crazy positions like these as I
just

999
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,839
passion you showed you and

1000
01:05:28,839 --> 01:05:31,890
when you take a look like them apart it
looks from

1001
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:35,410
a little bit like this you see 5 all 50
much

1002
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:38,690
5 also and has beings everywhere

1003
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:45,690
the now there's good news and bad news

1004
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:51,720
the bad news is that 15 pins

1005
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:55,589
the good news is that the key is I am

1006
01:05:55,589 --> 01:05:59,839
small its thin and because there are
holes

1007
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:02,839
on all the sites of the key a

1008
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:06,910
the key cuts can never be deep because
sometimes with a normal lock

1009
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:11,349
I like this normal key

1010
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:14,589
you should have a very deep cut you have
a hike up

1011
01:06:14,589 --> 01:06:19,549
and the difference between the highest a
possible in the lowest cost possible

1012
01:06:19,549 --> 01:06:23,160
is the number of combinations possible

1013
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:27,529
and with this you can only make a very
thin

1014
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:31,160
also the if you if you go

1015
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:35,440
if you would tension on the lock and you
go in with the appropriate

1016
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,119
picture 20 ish the just touching the
been

1017
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:44,039
might said just because there's only a
little bit of power needed

1018
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:48,450
to to get it to the right position
sometimes you over bullshit but

1019
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:53,210
I am at the beginning when I sure the
staple marks I thought it was not

1020
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:56,319
possible to pick them because it just 15
pins thats

1021
01:06:56,319 --> 01:07:00,808
really a lot of things but a.m. I found
that it was possible

1022
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:05,240
pic

1023
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:08,980
now this is a I am lips

1024
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:11,980
at all the minutes wanna

1025
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:15,299
popular security locks in in in Europe

1026
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:18,650
because it s 15 pins in them I just show
you

1027
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:22,700
he have humility flying Witch in I
didn't pick

1028
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,880
don't I am

1029
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,609
this is a quite a morning walk because
it is protect against

1030
01:07:29,609 --> 01:07:33,180
pulling out of door with the screw and I
can

1031
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:39,140
showing they made an extra hard and
steel

1032
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:42,598
stainless steel I mechanism that you
cannot

1033
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:46,119
this lock out of the door and

1034
01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:50,630
it's supposed to be really secure and
and you're not allowed to copy the keys

1035
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:52,170
of it and I'm

1036
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:56,750
its is one of the higher security here
clark's now

1037
01:07:56,750 --> 01:08:00,309
what I use to open it is nothing more
than a tensioner and

1038
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:03,529
the this donuts

1039
01:08:03,529 --> 01:08:08,450
is just a little

1040
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:11,700
l-shaped a to and I you should

1041
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:14,779
to the hid the beings just

1042
01:08:14,779 --> 01:08:18,170
moving left and right and up because

1043
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:22,589
that's where the beans are here here and
here and what I do is I will just put

1044
01:08:22,589 --> 01:08:23,580
tension on the lock

1045
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:27,809
a and then try to said all 15 binge one
of the time

1046
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:30,889
and find the bins that are

1047
01:08:30,889 --> 01:08:34,100
going smoothly and

1048
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:39,900
and see how far I can get it might take
some time shall

1049
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:43,500
maybe on can entertain you in a funny
story about that

1050
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:47,639
father and lorries good

1051
01:08:47,639 --> 01:08:50,880
happened one maybe someone has a

1052
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,609
a funny story but a any questions

1053
01:08:54,609 --> 01:08:59,239
at and

1054
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:02,949
they work very fast

1055
01:09:02,949 --> 01:09:07,469
and big guns shotguns and working with
electro pics

1056
01:09:07,469 --> 01:09:10,600
a.m. do day work and

1057
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,380
I don't know if you're familiar with it
with the game where where you have

1058
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:17,859
a number of metal balls paying

1059
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:21,009
you pick one bowl and really said

1060
01:09:21,009 --> 01:09:24,270
and the owner the only bowl that will
actually

1061
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:28,159
a move at that time a small and and the
other end

1062
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:32,589
a.m. that's basically the principle of a
pic gone and

1063
01:09:32,589 --> 01:09:36,460
Electra pick us well a what you try to
do

1064
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:41,810
annis hit all the pins a inside look at
the same time

1065
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:45,330
in such a way that the options are

1066
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:48,479
a.m. dejected into

1067
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:55,480
a notation open K

1068
01:09:58,910 --> 01:09:59,540
a graduate

1069
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:03,969
do need to interrupt your story yeah I'm
sorry a.m.

1070
01:10:03,969 --> 01:10:07,890
when you open high-security look like
this the

1071
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:11,170
the first time I bought a la can
actually opened it I was really happy

1072
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:12,280
that it worked

1073
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:15,509
and I moved it to a 45 degree angle

1074
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:20,580
and was surprised at all the beings just
came out and I liked the hell is this

1075
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:24,530
but its open so if you pick a lot like
this

1076
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:27,699
take a key cupcake half of it

1077
01:10:27,699 --> 01:10:31,710
and put it in then you can

1078
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:35,520
safely turn it but if you don't do this
a

1079
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,890
you're in big trouble because you'll
ruin the lock and that these

1080
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:43,090
there's a difference between this lock
which

1081
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:46,880
hasn't open gate essential pollack and

1082
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,590
the shoulder model that is closed

1083
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:53,780
and with the close one you don't need to

1084
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:57,460
food I F key in there but with the open
once

1085
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:01,150
the make sure that you have I have key
around

1086
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:04,400
to to open it because you will get in
big trouble

1087
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,410
back to the big day directed by guns and

1088
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:12,559
so what you try to do is and become has
a needle

1089
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,180
you put it inside lock and

1090
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:20,410
and then put enough energy on it

1091
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:23,500
so that the lower parts all

1092
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:26,739
on Lowell Benz will stay at that
position

1093
01:11:26,739 --> 01:11:30,430
and you only checked the occupants and
if

1094
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:35,380
you do that and I follow that motion wit

1095
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:38,400
just a little a delay

1096
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,540
with your attention up then you can open
a lock

1097
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:44,790
and its it's fairly easy to do want you
know the

1098
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:47,989
technique is a special technique within

1099
01:11:47,989 --> 01:11:51,650
electro pic things are even easier
because

1100
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:55,089
that thing will vibrate and and such a
high a

1101
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:58,400
frequency a its

1102
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,680
even easier to to pick a lock using such
a tool

1103
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:06,260
but then again this is more fun because

1104
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:10,250
this is really solving a puzzle all the
hour is

1105
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:16,920
using a technique to open a lock make

1106
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,630
a I don't know if you have any but
technique a cell

1107
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:24,330
and it's much easier to open away from
locking

1108
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:27,989
way for way to lock doesn't have any

1109
01:12:27,989 --> 01:12:32,260
pins but metal plates a but you have to
move in

1110
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:36,540
in a special a and special or and a tool
to use

1111
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:41,510
a new way for luck is thanks where Am I

1112
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:44,960
something like this I don't this or in
to

1113
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,429
call the eight which has two of those a

1114
01:12:48,429 --> 01:12:51,900
a.m. round shapes on top

1115
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:56,590
that's a tool to you to use on a way to
lock they're fairly easy to open

1116
01:12:56,590 --> 01:13:00,580
he way

1117
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:03,969
the Wayfarer way for are yes

1118
01:13:03,969 --> 01:13:09,989
wing

1119
01:13:09,989 --> 01:13:13,370
yep you'll find these most of time on

1120
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:17,599
a on cabinets and the and perhaps even
office doors

1121
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:24,600
and back

1122
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:38,090
reversed picking

1123
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:41,530
make from

1124
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:47,000
well I know something call a it's it's
it's actually designed by

1125
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,160
okay the question was a

1126
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:53,330
reverse picking first pushing all the
pins down

1127
01:13:53,330 --> 01:13:57,380
and then leading to tension go and
hoping that one by one they will

1128
01:13:57,380 --> 01:14:01,860
the right back I N that's the difficult
and

1129
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:06,349
I tried it but it didn't work for me
what I did here was

1130
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:09,660
about them israeli invention to arm

1131
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:13,130
open almost any no more lock

1132
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:17,060
buyout is going to sleep on their its
interest in it yeah

1133
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:19,670
under the first run with it

1134
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:24,430
me okay and messenger segment such an
interesting plus the

1135
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:27,930
I'm sorry good

1136
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:32,520
meh day

1137
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:38,540
within okay

1138
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,730
okay israeli convention

1139
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:43,890
put in a blank in in the lock and the

1140
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:46,960
show pushing all the bins up to the
highest level possible

1141
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,120
and and putting liquid actually I'd in
it

1142
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,460
up to oxygen now isn't a good time gene
called

1143
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:56,490
cool stuff a you either

1144
01:14:56,490 --> 01:15:00,400
League written liquid nitrogen it will
freeze

1145
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,750
the lock all the beings will stay in
place at the springs won't work anymore

1146
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,270
because the so-called

1147
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:09,940
there's no pressure on it and everything
will just be a today's

1148
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:13,030
than what they do is they stick in a hot
needle

1149
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:18,240
and the toppings will heat up ordered
the bottom being to heat up first and by

1150
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:19,550
gravity fall down

1151
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:23,630
and the walk will turn day

1152
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:27,650
and in in Europe all the locks are
upside down so the trick doesn't work

1153
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:32,080
but a but if if a lot is mounted like
this

1154
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,550
that is a fairly easy an effective way
to

1155
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:39,450
to enter and break and enter without
doing any damage

1156
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:43,019
and also about intelligent agents use

1157
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:48,060
and if you really are afraid that they
can they will go into your house

1158
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:51,680
and if you have a reason to believe that
a.m.

1159
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:55,850
just understand that there is no way of
protecting your house

1160
01:15:55,850 --> 01:16:00,030
against intelligence burglary teams that
want to break into your house

1161
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:03,759
that's not possible because if they can
break into some

1162
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,790
embassy you know what what your house
with the

1163
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:10,050
medical by actual shoe per lock the

1164
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:14,340
going to help its not because I heard of
a technique that the

1165
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:17,400
Dutch secret service users to get into
houses

1166
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:21,280
and they normally can open any lock but
if someone is really clever

1167
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:25,740
and gets a lot is really good and they
cannot pick it they will

1168
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:29,040
make a copy of that lock name

1169
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,620
and and and outside looking copies are
two pins inside the airport don't know

1170
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:34,970
the combination and what what the sizes
are

1171
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:39,880
but they will try to make a good as
possible copy of that lock

1172
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:43,300
and they will drill your log out of your
door but leave the

1173
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,440
lower pins intact the so they just

1174
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:50,300
replaced the lock for you and they put
your own inner cylinder back into your

1175
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:50,820
lock

1176
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:53,860
and it still works is still high
security

1177
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:57,219
but they made a copy of your lock and
thats edits

1178
01:16:57,220 --> 01:17:01,100
just just forget about it if you really
are something a

1179
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:05,820
that there's no way to too high and if
you have anything sensitive just keep it

1180
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:07,030
on you because

1181
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:11,300
they will find if that's your concern is
open when

1182
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:15,450
you know lot sure okay but some people
are paranoid

1183
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:18,898
a steel door and anyway

1184
01:17:18,899 --> 01:17:21,539
yeah okay well then a

1185
01:17:21,539 --> 01:17:24,709
maybe the law special or the

1186
01:17:24,709 --> 01:17:27,709
it's called the milk the law and not the
lock

1187
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:32,188
cuz this DVD is looking key with all the
holes in it

1188
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:36,119
the in it it works the same as the

1189
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:40,110
lips Oct 09 just open but little
different because

1190
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:43,579
it has all bins soda being

1191
01:17:43,579 --> 01:17:47,058
inside his lock and I i also brought
them open version of it but

1192
01:17:47,059 --> 01:17:50,219
of course doesn't do any good I

1193
01:17:50,219 --> 01:17:54,340
it has a hoping and inside the bin is
another been

1194
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:58,129
so that been in been and when you can't
look at the key

1195
01:17:58,129 --> 01:18:02,050
you should it is not only a whole but
it's a whole with either a smaller hole

1196
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:04,860
in there all with either something
sticking out

1197
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:09,129
sticking in a bin to a certain level and
did really

1198
01:18:09,129 --> 01:18:12,209
the is she's freaking people out to say
wow

1199
01:18:12,209 --> 01:18:17,079
bin ich bin and so you have five pins
within a binge in its 10 pins

1200
01:18:17,079 --> 01:18:20,419
the all mounted in this small the

1201
01:18:20,419 --> 01:18:24,239
get a.m. but is cool you

1202
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:27,530
can and open them with a

1203
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:32,409
just a simple piece of metal like this
it's a smaller l-shaped thing and I just

1204
01:18:32,409 --> 01:18:36,889
a used minutes you might be on one ish

1205
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:40,630
up

1206
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:44,179
he I got away

1207
01:18:44,179 --> 01:18:48,520
denying and actually

1208
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,580
a in they used to be together like this

1209
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:56,980
but I cut them into showed a good fit
into my

1210
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:01,110
a KGB picture so a.m.

1211
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:04,380
Nazi over here I got a locker

1212
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:07,659
I don't think that there's anyone any
and nice

1213
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:12,759
visual effects I'll just try to open it
maybe some people have

1214
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:19,760
the questions right the

1215
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:25,670
yes they are there

1216
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:30,530
a.m. an

1217
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:33,699
commercially up

1218
01:19:33,699 --> 01:19:37,590
up up to 10 say 441

1219
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:43,760
key I'm questions yep

1220
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:49,670
the no themselves as

1221
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:54,130
yes the hitting

1222
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:57,570
getting then use big guns yet

1223
01:19:57,570 --> 01:20:03,130
because you have high speed electronic
big guns with the

1224
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:06,260
it's really something should work

1225
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:09,699
and also commercial companies

1226
01:20:09,699 --> 01:20:12,780
and open doors for people sometimes use
that

1227
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:19,340
yep

1228
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:23,600
I am yeltsin time I'm not from the US

1229
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,110
I have very little experience with
medical

1230
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:30,719
I have heard rumors of a picture

1231
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:34,620
available for medical show you can pick
the lock but

1232
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:37,739
I I know for sure that there's something
called a

1233
01:20:37,739 --> 01:20:40,830
decoder and it's it's a

1234
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:46,519
I'm a feeling the vice that goes into
the lock and actually measures the bins

1235
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:50,030
and then it will tell you what beings
are in the lock

1236
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:53,070
and you can program that into our

1237
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:56,159
computerized key cutter and it will make
you toukie

1238
01:20:56,159 --> 01:21:00,299
but that said is only available for

1239
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:04,080
intelligence agencies if you buy that

1240
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:11,080
with the normal burglary and not going
to have any trouble

1241
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:14,219
yet

1242
01:21:14,219 --> 01:21:20,010
up

1243
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:25,269
I I could but I think we're running out
of time and and it also requires an

1244
01:21:25,269 --> 01:21:29,289
special accepts and I don't have that
with Michel

1245
01:21:29,289 --> 01:21:32,949
adds a little bit difficult to explain
something if you don't have a long and

1246
01:21:32,949 --> 01:21:34,650
the keys and the big set so

1247
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:37,969
the in next time me

1248
01:21:37,969 --> 01:21:41,820
he walks

1249
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:45,150
yet money not really

1250
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:48,900
hick

1251
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:53,559
now that's why you still when you buy
safe or when you go to the bank and you

1252
01:21:53,559 --> 01:21:54,439
see defaults

1253
01:21:54,439 --> 01:21:57,510
the they still have the old a

1254
01:21:57,510 --> 01:22:01,400
we called in to your inbox

1255
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:04,499
would leaving

1256
01:22:04,499 --> 01:22:11,499
well stuff like a with that

1257
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:19,040
me

1258
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:22,840
I am would

1259
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:27,969
the mobile app expecting

1260
01:22:27,969 --> 01:22:31,640
okay I am no it doesn't make a
difference for me

1261
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:37,179
I can no not at all it's not well
designed for

1262
01:22:37,179 --> 01:22:41,500
and i picking it looks like it and I'm
picking but the

1263
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:48,500
it's fairly easy up

1264
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:53,000
help easy as hell

1265
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,690
yeah I'm serious I mean the car I think
the

1266
01:22:57,690 --> 01:23:01,640
but a I mean what's what's with a good
the server

1267
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:04,710
a car like do you when you can get take
a break and

1268
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:08,310
knowing me knowing us that's the drug is
going to happen anyway and

1269
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:12,739
if you don't have a real expensive car
like a mercedes or Porsche

1270
01:23:12,739 --> 01:23:17,290
your luck is probably were fifty cents
for something they they don't spend any

1271
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:18,690
money on luxury

1272
01:23:18,690 --> 01:23:23,550
Carson easy to open alway from locks and
fairly simple
