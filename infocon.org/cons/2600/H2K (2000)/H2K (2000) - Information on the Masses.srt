1
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,980
argue no outlets let's start and pray
for

2
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,489
for a live connection in the next 10
minutes my name's the wrong bomb

3
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:47,680
I am an investigator arm

4
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,239
many other people in this room know me
have worked with me for the past fifteen

5
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,110
to twenty years

6
00:00:53,110 --> 00:01:00,110
for one fellow who thought he won the
spot the Fed contest were good

7
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:06,390
yes again Packers &

8
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,360
private investigators have an enormous
amount income a

9
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,530
most important thing in common is that
we all not just believe

10
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,500
but know how important open information

11
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,720
to create a level playing field

12
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,030
today

13
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,970
the most important grantor and guarantor

14
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:36,020
power is information if information is
closed

15
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,179
a few people that have access to it will
have

16
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,150
nearly unlimited power from a few if we
get a live connection I'm gonna

17
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,630
demonstrate to some

18
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,119
private databases out there that frankly
allow everyone to workers their own

19
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,450
private investigator

20
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,330
allow a moms to collect from deadbeat
dad

21
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,470
background investigation what-have-you
without having to rely

22
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,960
our law enforcement or even worse

23
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,030
the government there is now a movement a

24
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,569
by so-called privacy advocates to close
all information and you are

25
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,090
everything from driving records the
vehicle records

26
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,629
the property records to corporation
ownership

27
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:26,470
to permissible portions of your credit
report

28
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,629
typically call credit hatter's and the
privacy advocates because their argument

29
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:34,640
sounds great have been

30
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,090
almost universally successful you cannot

31
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,939
access driving records anymore unless
you

32
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,659
go through private investigator or you
have a subpoena a

33
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,189
an Act was passed call the driver
problems with a texan act you cannot

34
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:54,650
in the state of California for example
access voter registration record

35
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:00,530
a real property records are in the
process of being closed in Washington DC

36
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,700
I get to the pool the Houston more all
the elected

37
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,920
individuals that on property I'll

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,040
after november twelfth every portion

39
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,819
of credit records will be closed you
will need

40
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,430
the same justification for Credit Act
the

41
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,540
justification to obtain even a social
security

42
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,689
number verification that you now need to
obtain a full credit report

43
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:30,029
young resolve this is gonna be that

44
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:33,249
the average personal ninety-nine point
nine percent of the people in this

45
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:33,870
country

46
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,169
will have no legal access to

47
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:41,349
fairly essential data sources and
information

48
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:46,959
information which allows them to check
the background oven and collected the

49
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,029
I'll verify that the person driving
their school bus doesn't have a DUI

50
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:52,819
conviction

51
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:56,010
let me give you an example up some

52
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,840
people who slip through the cracks I
just in a case

53
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,969
in washington where the director about
the

54
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:09,569
administrative director of a law firm
when we redid his background

55
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:12,859
investigation because he just passed the
bar me want to become

56
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:17,200
an attorney for the firm we found out
that the bar association had missed two

57
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,750
prior convictions and I'll

58
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,089
but he was a two-time loser arm

59
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,190
I'll give you the headline from some
newspaper article

60
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,830
for more of the dark prince was accused
of stealing new

61
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,599
nearly two hundred thousand dollars from
his former employer a

62
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,080
a former Green run high school security
officer was convicted of four

63
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:46,080
misdemeanor charges teacher facing abuse
charges can't tutor kids Monroe City

64
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,040
nursing home administrator them for life
in prison without parole for stabbing

65
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,360
the

66
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,930
all these people had prior arrests

67
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,310
would have shown up had their employer

68
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,920
or the people responsible for screening
them prior to hire

69
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:12,920
hiring them had they been able to check
background wall

70
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,910
date is being close bizarrely there is
no more data available than ever which

71
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,400
which

72
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,910
ideally would be available to the masses

73
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,170
I know that double cork and cookie use

74
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,840
and various other types of data
gathering methods

75
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,270
have been in the press lately but the
fact is

76
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,950
there are much better not that the
gathering information that are being

77
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,840
used today

78
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,110
that provide a complete dossier on
almost everyone in this world

79
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,380
without their knowledge every computer
today has a GUID

80
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,680
universal that a fire which track

81
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,180
that users every step on the Internet

82
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,010
it doesn't matter if they delete cookies
after every session the GUID is still

83
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,530
reachable if you bought a Pentium three

84
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,620
and you haven't actually taken steps to
turn off

85
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,900
the pentium chips serial number that
tracks

86
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,060
if you have a high-speed connection
specially DSL ISDN

87
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,380
in your home everywhere you go

88
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,420
your unique IP address tracks everything
you've done

89
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,680
you can delete cookies you can avoid
double cork you can

90
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,070
turn banners of it won't help

91
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,110
in addition to the for the past 20 years

92
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,110
every major marketing company in America

93
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,850
has been developing and perfecting
something called psychographic

94
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,130
sure you've all heard demographics
demographics

95
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,320
is ancient history psychographic is the
way to go

96
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,349
for example a million-dollar study
discovered

97
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,600
that people who own cats and dry
volkswagens

98
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,720
like Skippy Peanut Butter it's an actual
store

99
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,400
the vast majority of the people who own
cats and dry Volkswagen

100
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,460
other people a like Skippy Peanut Butter

101
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,090
skippy peanut butter has marketed the
hell are both people

102
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,990
it is a %uh and innocent marketing study

103
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,830
but it's an example of what's possible
mailing list

104
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,870
if you are a member of the NRA you
probably own ago and it's not guarantee

105
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,670
but you probably own a gun

106
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:37,330
if you are a member of the AARP you have
certain characteristics

107
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,530
if you subscribe the cat fancier Journal
you have certain characters

108
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,070
by the way that other study was done
company called RL Polk

109
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:48,900
took all of the volkswagen beetle
registration from the country

110
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,420
cross-reference that with people who
either subscribe to

111
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,550
a various types of magazines and
journals concerning cat

112
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:04,060
or have whoever have purchase medication
for cats that sort of thing

113
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,040
and they were able to identify these
people marketable

114
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,500
if you subscribed to soldier fortune
magazine you have a certain profile

115
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,870
if you subscribe to a grower a journal
for gay people

116
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,210
you are almost certainly be a

117
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,310
today anyone doing the minimal amount of
research

118
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,490
and spending a minimal amount of money
can find out your likes and dislikes or

119
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,440
sexual orientation

120
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,099
sure your religion a I'm Jewish and I
have to tell you

121
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,229
every Jew in this country is our mailing
list

122
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:43,909
if you are jewish you get

123
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:48,920
it in just just a remarkable number
solicitations from

124
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,050
everything from the you JA to the jewish
defense league

125
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:59,050
the the what happened there we'll all
have to live for

126
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:09,080
owned and you're saying this does not
have a key logging program

127
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,760
well this is a demo account anyway

128
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:19,760
not at all don't pull the wire please
don't work Wed

129
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,279
where all

130
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:32,769
a and hard worker

131
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:37,310
hey what you do take this laptop and try
to cope connect the people finder dotnet

132
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:44,310
when you connect give it back when it a
little bit about people finder dot net

133
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,970
in case by some miracle we actually got
a connection

134
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,740
as an investigator my company

135
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,199
was a a just a massive consumer

136
00:09:56,199 --> 00:10:01,260
every type the data possible if you can
locate someone or background someone

137
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,610
or what-have-you without leaving your
office

138
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:10,339
a more the better if before you go and
interview a witness you can find that

139
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:12,250
everything possible about that witness

140
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,269
more the better when

141
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:19,350
databases birth came into being when I
started out as an investigator

142
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,820
more than twenty years ago the
technologically advanced investigators

143
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,750
for the people who bought call the
rectory

144
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,199
and had them in their office and use
them for criss-cross and use them to

145
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,149
reverse number

146
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,260
arm I would go

147
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,730
to the New York Public Library on 42nd
Street at least once a week

148
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,329
because both directors were thousand
books back then

149
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:47,110
wall poor starving investigator I would
go down there and and use their Nassau

150
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,220
County reverse directory or other Queens
reverse directory

151
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,230
which I couldn't afford in

152
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,459
1992 want owned this

153
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:00,569
came into being and you could reverse
any number in the United States from

154
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:01,130
your

155
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,079
from your office this was for me like
the parting of the Red Sea it was a

156
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:06,779
miracle

157
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,949
and we realize that that there was a
trend

158
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:13,709
that more and more data was going to

who you live with who you work with

191
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,070
more likely than not your level of
education

192
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,010
if not the school you attended what you
majored in

193
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,670

today sadly something even I don't agree
with that I think

200
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,570
all information should be gathered and
be available

201
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,230
thanks to the net and kid web sites and
that sort of thing

202
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,480
people are now being tracked from the 80
as young as they can type

203
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,060
seven or eight or nine or ten up by the
time they actually turn 18 and

204
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,170
start using their social security number
which they now have two

205
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,020
apply for at birth a

206
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,560
instead it when they applied for a job

207
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,160
by the time they turn 18 will know
everything about for those of you that

208
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,140
have logged onto Amazon

209
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,510
after you delete your cookies and they
still tell you

210
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,959
well based on your last blog that
loggins we know that you're interested

211
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:01,709
in

212
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:07,300
Chinese cooking a murder mystery it's
because they keep massive data file

213
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,190
they don't need to check a couple for
those who view that log onto

214
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:17,410
me back and you're directed to an
auction on japanese flatware

215
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,949
it's because they've kept track of who
you are based on your login

216
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:25,660
and if you in any way shape or form
connected your name

217
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:31,170
your login email address and password
it's there in the database

218
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,640
by your name arm

219
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,910
it is child's play as I'm sure everyone
in this room knows better than me

220
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,569
to determine just for my name where
you're living

221
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,459
what Notre logging on from and very very
easily

222
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:53,420
correlating that the most likely address
if your name is Bob Jones in your

223
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,570
logging in from

224
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,180
a time while there's a limited number of
possibilities to your

225
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,080
I can find out

226
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,380
if you are gay or straight if you're
jewish most former Catholic

227

228
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,350
you pay your debt what your profession
who you

229
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,730
contribute to and by the way everyone
who contributes to a political party in

230
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,700
pays more than

231
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,110
a fairly minuscule amount of money your
name

232

now everyone who has contributed to his

243
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,550
campaign will be receiving a letter
asking why

244
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:16,849
and hopefully they won't contribute
again I know it's not exactly

245
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:20,480
supportive of the general political
process but

viewing room which

254
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,919
God willing will do

255
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,220
20 that whole its there's no graphics on
the website

256
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:03,310

257
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,840

258
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,060
front row to work my way back

259
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,110
phone book no no joke

260
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:19,179
no joke phone book retiree I did

261
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:22,450
but

262
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,720
oh okay the question is if you have only
in a min you want to find someone where

263
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,760
do you start

264
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,970
and the authors the phone book the vast
majority of the people that you're

265
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,929
looking for believe it or not going to
be in the phone book

266
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:37,270
I did a war crimes investigation up in
canada

267
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,990
we found a 161 war criminals over half a
phone book

268
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,410
course we looked on the were criminal
common not simple

269
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,580
daughter fair bad that bad

270
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,889
no we we we we actually did find

271
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,080
find the more than half for the war
criminals we were looking for

272
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,740
just by taking phone this Canada
databases in before

273
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,150
Canada 411 was on the matter and i'm
looking

274
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,000
and the rest we found through real
property records

275
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,419
voter registration records corporate
records

276
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,710
driving record motor vehicle records

277
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,790
these are all public record

278
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,918
not but it's possible to access them for
as little as a buck a lookup

279
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:28,679
so don't be rude

280
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,020
tell who the question

281
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,410
okay his question which I answered for
you getting the bequest I'm not gonna

282
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,460
answer quicker

283
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,970
gonna get the question after the answer
you wanted to know you only have a name

284
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,490
how do you start looking for the perfect
my suggestion tim was

285
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,250
start with the phone book and then move
on to more difficult

286
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:54,470
public record that crustal

287
00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:01,470
right

288
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,450
you are essentially

289
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,390
grew unless are repeat the question

290
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:14,800
you have to everybody FB request to
remind me to repeat the question his

291
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,740
question was

292
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,280
since we are not you meaning
investigators

293
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,080
where do we stand as far as access to
information and the answers you're

294
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,689
screwed

295
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,670
unless the next congress can be talked
to

296
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:32,760
unless the next president which I'm not
gonna tell you who I hope it is good for

297
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,600
get booed

298
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,660
a george bush a

299
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,550
a less or less unless someone all other
than a democratic elected

300
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,139
are ralph nader would be just fine with
me but someone

301
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,450
other than a democrat soul records will
stay open

302
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,160
I mean it's it's it's perverse you know
democrats are supposed to be the many

303
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,850
other people

304
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,690
but they close all the records under
Republican for all I haven't figured

305
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,360
that out yet

306
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,280
arm you will still be able to go onto
the net

307
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,410
and do searches through people finder
dotnet through

308
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:12,060
Nowak's through Merlin data Merlin's
really high-priced I'll go to them

309
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:16,800
a through locate fast outfits like that

310
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,690
but you're gonna be paying per look up
and once the records are firmly closed

311
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,890
I guarantee you everybody's prices are
gonna quadruple

312
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,780
so it's gonna cost you 100 bucks to do a
trace the right now you can do for

313
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,370
nothing

314
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,940
and nobody even knows you doing the
trace with you that it should be

315
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,430
why am I entitled

316
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,910
well first of all because I on the comp

317
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:45,170
I all rights but I spent a part of money
building the state about buying up to

318
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,440
I own the data you know aborted legally
and

319
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,340
there's a guy playing with the laptop
hopefully you all

320
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,280
the data arm people finder dotnet

321
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:03,690
probably the people arm in addition
certain records

322
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,430
are open to certain or license classes
of people

323
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,630
retailer headed to be an investigator I
have three years of law enforcement

324
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,020
experience

325
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:19,290
about the rancor patrol I had to submit
my fingerprint my photograph not just to

326
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,409
the state in New York

327
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:24,660
and the state taxes and the state of
Louisiana and the state of California

328
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,250
which place where your license to have
to submit another license application

329
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,520
I to go through background check the FBI

330
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,610
ran my prince each time I hit the submit
5 reference affidavit i the submit three

331
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,550
background affidavits

332
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,860
basically I had to go through proctology
exam

333
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,580
arm pretty close that that may
eventually

334
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,439
comfortable a I'd

335
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,590
and the only benefit if that is armed

336
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,100
I can where this should have a short
haircut and me

337
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,480
get driver license record that's about
it arm

338
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:09,480
are

339
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,090
Hillary you need to raise your hand but
I will take your call

340
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:20,090
yes I'll

341
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,680
I R with the probe told reporters you

342
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,930
but I i just to read the article well

343
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:32,380
yes yes

344
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,850
useful if at any scale

345
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:40,150
there's a guy in fact right now by the
majority Grogan's being investigated the

346
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,290
state of California

347
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,500
I'm told is a result of that that in

348
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,580
does not give you this for lightest

349
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,889
I older qualification for licensing
least not the state of New York or Texas

350
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,930
or Florida

351
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,560
or California or any place that I know
about you up to

352
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,830
actual honest to god prior investigative
experience

353
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:04,699
there it's a scale and by the way you'll
learn any

354
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:10,150
I frankly the the most mediocre hacker
could go in there and think about a

355
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:10,990
course for

356
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:17,990
dollars for more male for all

357
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:30,400
okay

358
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:38,970
you're saying with her concert tour
without a conform

359
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,580
cat another and how we find this person
right this is this is a really good

360
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,639
question because the

361
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,660
it leaves into whole discussion

362
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,900
about not only how massive data is
available now

363
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,830
but Howarth cross-reference in ways
never dreamed up

364
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,980
there there is a rule other databases
dado

365
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,830
always get use for or chrome for
purposes that was never intended to be

366
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,549
used for

367
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:14,120
we have records in our system now

368
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,799
that can be searched and not just us
although

369
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:21,570
credit bureaus all of the bigger
companies

370
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,210
who

371
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:28,100
okay once you connect the people finder
dotnet what you gonna do it

372
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:33,679
disconnect that so the whole room
doesn't think my login nothin

373
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:40,460
nothing personal guided

374
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:46,020
yeah everyone cover your hinged

375
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,110
well great

376
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:56,110
you know what the laptop crashed by with

377
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,730
acting up the my other

378
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,809
I'll of the Apple Users Group

379
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:07,360
is in your hands good

380
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,390
a Macintosh Apple you which

381
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:14,299
now you know I quit from you ago arm

382
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:19,059
it is now possible to search for example
for a female

383
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:24,039
just by first name and date of birth it
is now possible to search

384
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:27,240
just by date of birth the answer to your
questions by the way

385
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,760
when you adopt somebody they keep the
same date of birth

386
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,960
even if their names change and

387
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,080
wall actually you're talking about the
easiest type of search

388
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,500
the hardest type of search this summer
recess I've been adopted

389
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,120
please find my birth parents because
then you have to

390
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,950
to all kinds a monkey business which I
wanted me to in this room

391
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:54,130
what what you're telling me is you
actually know

392
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,700
that this person was adopted you know

393
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,820
their date of birth you know the place
and date of adoption

394
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,980
you don't know

395
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:10,980
when the child was born is her sister
now that

396
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:15,770
I'll real very sad

397
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:19,429
I I can find a cure for you and let me
tell you

398
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:24,250
without trying to be the man from behind
the curtain offers let me tell you

399
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,440
exactly how are we doing

400
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,140
I would send you ideally so I wouldn't
have to charge you

401
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,990
down to the courthouse the search all
the adoptions

402
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:38,409
within a three or four month period the
adoption records

403
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:43,340
up who did the adoption are open who
gave birth is what's close

404
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:48,100
but since you're only trying to find the
personal you get the name of the person

405
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,309
you get the data birth of the person I
can run that name and date of birth

406
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:57,789
nationwide in 45 seconds of the person's
address for

407
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:01,520
you couldn't do that five years ago or
ten years ago

408
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,649
you could do it five years ago now the
average investigator who calls you up in

409
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:06,990
South

410
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:12,480
you know this was a really hard case I
found this person all the way out in

411
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,840
Milwaukee you call my god this is
incredible this

412
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,320
five thousand dollar bill is presenting
me is unbelievably reasonable

413
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,760
what he did was urs he looked in the
book a public record

414
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,970
researchers call up somebody in the
local courthouse

415
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:30,340
settle down there but for the record
charge them

416
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,419
forty dollars for sparking back from the
information

417
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:38,280
he spent another five dollars on
databases be charged to five thousand

418
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,000
bucks

419
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,419
every single person in this room has a
right to have access to that type of

420
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:44,070
information

421
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:48,210
and that type ability now there there
are some exceptions

422
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,820
there has to be clearly there has to be

423
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:56,200
new penalties for misuse of information

424
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,960
I wouldn't want every James bardo who is
the person who called for better shape

425
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,080
his driver's license

426
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,590
anche tracked her down and shot or I
wouldn't want every James Barr don't

427
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,530
have access

428
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:15,030
to every possible information source but
99.999 percent to the people

429
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:18,149
maybe not miss room but in the world at
large

430
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:21,929
are not a danger to access information

431
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:24,059
a

432
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:28,580
I know that was a longer answer than you
wanted come and talk to me afterwards

433
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,059
I'll give you my card you do the hard
work all right for my database from of

434
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:34,840
a

435
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,210
near you all

436
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:46,210
yes there I'll

437
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:55,100
feel you claim they're not yours for

438
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,210
here that

439
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:05,210
there are well let let let me tell you
anybody that that

440
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,750
works on a name alone let something like

441
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,030
on thin ice caps the bishops which was a
the actual case of mine

442
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,940
a he is is of course a pretty

443
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,320
piss poor investigator you have to use
what's known as identifies

444
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,560
identifiers can be anything from a date
of birth and social security number

445
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,550
the last known address and believe me
with a name and

446
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:35,440
any that the fire I own you with your
name and an address I can get your date

447
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,060
of birth

448
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,730
with your name address and date of birth
I can get your social security number

449
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,910
it will call it will cost me a maximal

450
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:47,630
of six books to do that and it will take
me maximum

451
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:51,270
of to sixty second search so two minutes

452
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,150
once I got your name your date of birth
in your social security number

453
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:58,810
I i think you'll agree I can pretty much
getting

454
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:03,370
you're absolutely correct operating on
just a name

455
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:10,370
is slipshod investigations maybe not
europe

456
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,139
I think they've been as careful as me
for the past 100 years

457
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,220
for the past 100 years it has been legal

458
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:25,200
for me to get your driving record it has
been legal for me to get your

459
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,990
voter registration record it has been
legal for me to get your

460
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:32,170
motor vehicle property corporation

461
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,490
so on and so forth don't you think it's
appropriate for example

462
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:39,010
that before I extend you alone I should
know your

463
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:43,240
financial history in your prime minister
before I hire you to drive my kids

464
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,190
school bus

465
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:49,300
or be my kids man I should check your
driving record your criminal record

466
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,830
if you are a deadbeat dad and that's why
you're not paying your student loans

467
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:57,149
should not be able to collect from you
arm

468
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:01,720
you few I do a lot of investigation of
what school sophisticated financial

469
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,700
frauds

470
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,400
and you would be astounded how easy it
is to set up an alter ego

471
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,530
a new identity just by using a
corporation

472
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:14,570
and giving of all the personal lead
should not be able to find out who

473
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,250
really owns the corporation

474
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:21,470
and do other things that lead me to you
and allow me to

475
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:25,530
delivered to the police a packet that
they can avoid

476
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:29,220
me tell you something there is nothing
that I can do that the police can to a

477
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,320
hundred times better

478
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,879
the problem is the police arent

479
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,770
interested in most things that you and I
would consider significant

480
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:42,250
arm I'm doing a case for woman right now
will give your last name

481
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,310
our first name is Rita readers

482
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:51,250
husband with a psychiatrist they live in
a beautiful park avenue apartment

483
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:54,960
multi-millionaires he was

484
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,750
a I'm a all the side he was a a

485
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:03,430
let's say a talent agent for big rock
group one day he embezzled fifteen

486
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,090
million dollars from the rock group in
off we went to the end

487
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:11,160
readers now living in a homeless shelter
her kids are scattered with relatives

488
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,680
she is no way to track this guy down by
using databases

489
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,520
I was able to track the guy down by
going on martindale-hubbell I was able

490
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,240
to find her lawyer and France

491
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,050
which is where he's living now the
judgment against him

492
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:29,940
which is entered in the US which is
useless here will be entered in France

493
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,770
a new centrist public record database is
we're gonna be able to collect the

494
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:37,730
we will also be able to tell the marshal
service where this guy is

495
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:43,550
I'm group the long interesting most
things that you consider important the

496
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,120
police don't consider important

497
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,180
someone scams your fifteen thousand
dollars at your problem

498
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,280
we got murders to worry about arm

499
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,700
your nanny may have molested you care

500
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,810
well you know what we've got us to go
traipsing you've only got a maple

501
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:06,310
and so on and so forth you need to be
able to access information yourself

502
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,429
you need to be able to find out what you
need to know

503
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:13,110
to be safe to be happy to protect your
interest

504
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:16,899
it's it's it's just concert it's called
empowering the common male

505
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:20,960
you know what the best analogy is gone

506
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,129
there are eighty million legal

507
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:28,279
I don't know where you stand on guns
don't really care there

508
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,510
eighty million legal guns in this
country

509
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,000
the best vast majority of gun owners are
not running around shooting people

510
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,699
the vast majority of people who are
shooting people

511
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,980
are felons who could known guns in the
first place and they're using stolen or

512
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,918
illegally obtain gold

513
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:48,230
that absolutely analogous to the
situation with

514
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,659
information right now any good hacker

515
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:56,550
any unscrupulous investigator any
so-called information broker

516
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,800
can get your credit card bills can get
your phone bills

517
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,940
can do all sorts of things a

518
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:07,390
everything you can imagine it's not
legal

519
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,799
but somebody who wants the legally
protect their rights and interests

520
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,800
camp so next question

521
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,129
remaining anonymous on the other

522
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:29,770
all the youth

523
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:34,240
systems are what there are there are
some

524
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,000
outfits I I've actually never use your
knowledge with a Mac guy and they only

525
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,160
have one dose of four

526
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,640
although after today no longer America

527
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,129
I'm sorry there's a Mac beta okay well

528
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:50,720
that I'll be able to speak more
authoritatively about 1/3 cup

529
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,339
the Maxis but I can tell you almost
certainly

530
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:57,990
anyone determined to break through that
type a proxy

531
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:03,040
firewall is going to be able to do
they're gonna be able to do it by seeing

532
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,950
wear use or sooner or later you gonna
send out an email

533
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,129
even if it's filtered through their
email address there's gonna be some

534
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,270
think in the text of the email

535
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:16,960
analyst using zero-knowledge and PGP

536
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,589
and a public terminal at a cyber cafe
you've got no hope

537
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:25,680
a the the GUID on your system is gonna
turn %um

538
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,359
the ships that are appearing on all

539
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,540
intel machines are gonna turn in where
you go what you do

540
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:38,310
your email the contents of your email
organ attorney in and by the way

541
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,430
if you wanna post to a newsgroup

542
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:45,348
forget about a

543
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:48,380
all IOU's not post things can now be

544
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,130
scanned by anyone I don't forget about
the major news

545
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:55,750
any news reader can scan all-news not
post things

546
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,930
or all newsgroup postings all the
postings

547
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:03,140
by any keyword by any name by any
combination of keywords

548
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,730
that they're looking for a guy Bob in
milwaukee

549
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,609
it's possible to do an intelligent
information search and find you no

550
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:11,190
matter

551
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:16,630
what proxy firewall using what bogus
email address you used

552
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,810
it's just not possible one of the things
that makes

553
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:24,279
really not possible is the massive
amount of computing power available to

554
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,940
anyone

555
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:28,420
the computing power in my office right
now

556
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:32,180
is greater than what was available to
the credit bureaus five years ago

557
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,520
computing power the credit bureaus today

558
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,040
is really on a par with the CIA

559
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,160
forget about Big Brother CIA NSA

560
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,399
yes it's true they gather every scrap of
knowledge

561
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,970
that's out there but they never look at
it and if they do look at it

562
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,970
they don't know what the hell it yes the
people fear worry about

563
00:37:54,970 --> 00:38:00,900
are private industry private companies
who have a financial interest

564
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,690
in looking up your by heart in knowing
everything about you the CIA unless

565
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,800
you're a terrorist or

566
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,569
planning or not even a hacker let me
tell you that

567
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:15,140
what's your good hacker a really good
actor

568
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:18,770
and no they only want to identify you to
hire so

569
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,759
CIA really doesn't care about that
unless you're in the process of

570
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,180
of of committing a crime I I'm

571
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,799
private industry desperately wants to
know who you are your life through

572
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,430
dislikes

573
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,879
your residence everyone in your family
the up small children

574
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,460
does your wife have diabetes the most
intrusive thing you can imagine

575
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,980
is worth money to them and money makes
the world go around so they are going to

576
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,130
use the profit motive

577
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:47,550
together every scrap of information
about you

578
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:52,210
and extrapolate out using on believably
accurate psychographic

579
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,210
unbelievably accurate take

580
00:38:55,210 --> 00:39:00,260
are really accurate profile love you
match with your name and address forget

581
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:04,609
they've got your name and address and
your data for I N your social security

582
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:05,410
number

583
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,859
and they're gonna market like mad to so

584
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:13,619
but we need to worry about you shouldn't
care

585
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:19,230
you shouldn't care another point I want
to make I know that everybody here is

586
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:25,060
running around with some kinda screen
name on their bad Jew

587
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:29,160
worried about big brother a little
sister or what have you

588
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,410
a normal person has no real reason to
heart

589
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:38,868
a normal person should not care if I
know you like Skippy Peanut Butter

590
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:42,430
a normal person should not care I know

591
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:46,109
that you have an eighty percent mortgage
on your house alright it's kind of

592
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:47,598
embarrassing but big deal

593
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,560
a normal person should not be concerned
about the

594
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,750
now mind you they're all our

595
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,260
extreme examples where

596
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,640
you really deserve your privacy in the
people who intrude into it our school

597
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,779
a anti-abortion groups to copy the

598
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:10,210
license plates at abortion clinics and
then after this unbelievably traumatic

599
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,200
experience that the woman is going
through

600
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,240
sent them a letter saying before you
kill your next child

601
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,900
and so on and so forth this is what are
the reasons why they close

602
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,220
proper license records cell a thats

603
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,619
will well beyond the log but most have
you

604
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:32,490
a a lecture a career criminal you've got
no worry about your career criminal

605
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,930
speaking as an investigator I wanna know
everything about you

606
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:42,930
I'll one more follow-up

607
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,510

question

608
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,580
no I'm not going to do that was a
phenomenal question if you didn't hear

609
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:56,529
knock that what what what what's the
motivation behind the people who want to

610
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,500
close the records

611
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,460
you know what force the ball there is a
certain

612
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:09,420
political mindset among people who are
frozen in amber in the sixth

613
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,040
who believe that the individual

614
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,869
must be anonymous Big Brother

615
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:20,920
is out there looking at everyone

616
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:26,150
prob done in a couple big brother is out
there looking at everyone we have to

617
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,900
close all these records

618
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,470
let me tell you something the other

citizen

621
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:38,240
and disempowering the private citizen
there's that

622
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,790
type a personal then there are people
who honest I got something to hide

623
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:46,200
and they've got a hideously selfish
motive

624
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,970
bless you my sup

625
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:55,300

annoyance

632
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:35,810
on the screen back to your question

633
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,779
there are people who are misguided there
are people are selfish motives

634
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,210
and there are people who were born into
the argument

635
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:46,680
that privacy is great people deserve
their

636
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,118
anonymity you know the word to the
Supreme Court Justice the right to be

637
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:51,040
left alone

638
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,810
its ball its absolute ball

639
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,890
when you close these records the only
people

640
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:02,790
that you're denying access and to are
you government was for complete access

641
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:07,950
believe me hackers will store complete
access maybe you anywhere but

642
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:12,310
hackers will still have complete access
people willing to break the law also

643
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:13,529
have complete access

I can get your phone bill I can get your
credit card bill it's not legal

call

646
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,630

or because in america

704
00:47:27,709 --> 00:47:31,359
we believe or the question is why

705
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,939
telemarketing companies you need their
permission to market them and

714
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:11,819
the bottom line is in this country we
like to trust people

715
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:17,099
we like self-regulation that's why
there's a direct marketing association

716
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:22,069
which are occasionally a bunch a weasel
but if you opt out if you give them

717

your name every one of their members

805
00:54:21,209 --> 00:54:24,660
what how many were questions that we
have because this guy wants me to get

806
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:28,239
off the said

807
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:30,819
records and other parts of the world I'm
guessing you're gonna ask about the

808
00:54:30,819 --> 00:54:31,680
United Kingdom

809
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,769
a but I guess what was it will coverup
specific question is a general question

810
00:54:36,769 --> 00:54:40,049
legally not

811
00:54:40,049 --> 00:54:43,690
illegally same as the US I

812
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:47,400
phone records people have now cracked
the

813
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:53,489
the the british telecom desk for you can
reverse phone numbers and addresses and

814
00:54:53,489 --> 00:54:55,299
people have been sneakily

815
00:54:55,299 --> 00:54:58,900
buying up a property records and voter
rolls in

816
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,369
setting up servers in the Channel
Islands which good for them

817
00:55:02,369 --> 00:55:06,069
arm but it's like I mean it's like
smuggling cocaine

818
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:10,670
inning when getting getting information
about it is it is a felony

819
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:13,670
it is that to misuse the database

820
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:17,400
in the United Kingdom is the same
criminal property

821
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,799
as personal possession of cocaine that's
absolutely true

822
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:24,449
so yes you can get it all a

823
00:55:24,449 --> 00:55:28,039
and Parliament is packed full adoption

824
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:32,039

always try to be as high as possible on
the food chain

868
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:17,038
becomes the information and in life
that's your

869
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:21,219
little lesson for the day one more
question and I'm done

870
00:58:21,219 --> 00:58:26,009
did you ever before you are what's the
question

871
00:58:26,009 --> 00:58:29,859
I good

872
00:58:29,859 --> 00:58:36,859
say what first thing would

873
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:43,380
rape

874
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,599
while no it doesn't

875
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:49,690
no it doesn't Berbers

876
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:52,690
the first personal that says

877
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:57,440
you must turn on your GUID to access
this website

878
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,569
and the innocent person goes or

879
00:59:00,569 --> 00:59:03,910
okay were no

880
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:07,979
first of all GUID is not reverse
engineering anything

881
00:59:07,979 --> 00:59:11,229
it was designed to generate a GUID

882
00:59:11,229 --> 00:59:14,929
if the pentium chip personal GUID is not
the chip you talking about two different

883
00:59:14,929 --> 00:59:15,509
things

884
00:59:15,509 --> 00:59:19,380
few ideas what's a better than a lot of
and a lot of software programs

885
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:23,559
that gives a unique and then a fire
every document you generate and so on

886
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:25,069
and so forth

887
00:59:25,069 --> 00:59:28,959
the pentium chip the new pentium 3 chip
and everybody else's chips are coming

888
00:59:28,959 --> 00:59:30,489
out despite

889
00:59:30,489 --> 00:59:34,089
what everyone else tells you generate
unique

890
00:59:34,089 --> 00:59:37,429
social up excuse me serial

891
00:59:37,429 --> 00:59:40,759
some social the investigator and kicked
in

892
00:59:40,759 --> 00:59:45,920
up a serial mom's so number one it's not
reverse engineering by any stretch of

893
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,630
the imagination a law

894
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:51,380
a number two go ahead and try to
prosecute

895
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,990
a

896
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:59,990
you know II I would be who'd

897
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:08,230
and that is in fact the least efficient
way to do it

898
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:13,640
there are many many many other ways for
example

899
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,750
if you take advantage of the netscape a

900
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:21,580
programming that allows you to drag
honor roll

901
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,660
to the topic in netscape are innkeepers
what are your favorites

902
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:28,529
almost every website that uses Java now

903
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:32,680
camp all those favorite style almost
every website can see

904
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:37,280
what you've programmed as your email
adultery even if you don't send out an

905
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:37,750
email

906
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:42,540
arm there's just a million other
examples these guys gonna kill me forget

907
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,099
the side

908
01:00:43,099 --> 01:00:46,740
I will be where all the way we were
before where

909
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:51,240
where can I go to to okay you know I'm
gonna go to the network room

910
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,490
and maybe spy network connection all
rights of reproduction
