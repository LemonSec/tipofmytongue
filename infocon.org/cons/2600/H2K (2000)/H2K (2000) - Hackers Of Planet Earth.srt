1
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,410
good strategy is something that uses the
fact that we are at

2
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,940
we can be faster than them and we have
more of a sense of humor

3
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,239
and but those that's the good news but
the bad news is those are really are

4
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,320
only weapons

5
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,150
so rethinking thinking up new strategies
and thinking and and using whatever you

6
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,940
do well

7
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,349
in some way that they haven't seen
before and and and making that your life

8
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,830
for six months and then going out and
doing something else

9
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,630
may be much more important than any of
the traditional means above

10
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,800
activism doesn't really a

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,869
the traditional means of activism above

12
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:15,380
motivating other people to to spend
their life doing this thing

13
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,630
it's it's really about what you can do
that that's really different and has a

14
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,420
sense of humor

15
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,509
the two main weapons are ignorance and
different disinformation

16
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,440
and there is one saying the every
actor's a

17
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,030
someplace like me as well I kinda fell
in love with nyse:

18
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,800
information is power if you spread the
information if everybody knows the truth

19
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:43,800
then they can use their weapons back

20
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,600
yeah

21
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:16,600
history repeats itself

22
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,310
winning why I put this

23
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,310
child pornography to and

24
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,580
that the public and the media can be our
friends

25
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,610
because I mean what they actually do is
keep the people not only there's

26
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,630
you bid but use this unity with some
keywords

27
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,730
at to get acceptance for what they are
doing

28
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,179
things like child pornography I mean

29
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,550
they just use the the missing media come
to terms on the public

30
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,700
if it comes to two sets ended two

31
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,470
in issues and it can be our role as the
heck casinos

32
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,030
the a to explain the speeches 22 John
understand and get that

33
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,360
public know how cuz we can get

34
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,250
a smarter media and smarter people in
ourselves

35
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,380
than the politicians are so it

36
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,829
it's not the politics which makes us
trouble in in sometimes it's all the

37
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,680
people here

38
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,800
a not the official politics they are

39
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,360
simply used as as most of the the media

40
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,810
are so a I think we we can mention that

41
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:32,050
that in some address our problem is not
that the politicians we voted

42
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,489
the this upto them and being used by

43
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,930
by economic and Ann secret service
increase I'm

44
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:46,930
be

45
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:13,629
all

46
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:34,819
be a Yahoo

47
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:38,889
the question with about in football cell
I i mentioned it

48
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:42,310
very little bit they're worth the more
or less

49
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,979
campaign a and officially

50
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,840
run by the I hope all in it said to sell
the

51
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,250
group the cooperation up European are
European polices are the different

52
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:54,909
countries

53
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:59,159
they have one informal and minutes free
now

54
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,900
the Indian High the I will pose a
organization

55
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,289
and they wanted to have some and

56
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:11,389
ya laws European laws in all countries
sell that one country kid

57
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:14,550
intercept European citizen which is in
about

58
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,680
in another country this imitative called
in for Paul

59
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,749
was officially nonexistent

60
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:24,839
for a long time so they they said that
doesn't

61
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,110
exist such an idea and that's all
bullshit and and then

62
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,930
there was some papers found out by

63
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,029
let's call it investigative journalism
and not hacking on it maybe it's the

64
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,560
same

65
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,800
and from cell that they couldn't deny
that the Texas

66
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,379
but then it was the way and exactly this
this a.m.

67
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:49,479
this strategy discussion and is for this
new

68
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:53,219
stuff coming now simply called lawful
interception

69
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:59,550
also the European a a and a hill on
discussion for example does not mean

70
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,699
that we don't want to have a teleconf no
telecommunications interception our

71
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:04,520
privacy

72
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,779
so the French government is the the most
I'll the loudest government within the

73
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:09,909
European Union

74
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:13,810
criticizing the the US as a loan system
but not

75
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,710
saying that they are on the you know
doing something to our privacy and

76
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,129
that's not good for our society they're
saying

77
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:25,080
hey it can be that they are fine nothing
not with buying them

78
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,270
so we should build up our own system in
France is

79
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,589
actively building up its own system with
them all European countries

80
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:35,680
and also other countries to do

81
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,620
espionage and stuff like that and other
countries as well so

82
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,379
this is Morrison kinda up next step then
really are

83
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,699
you know nyse: development and

84
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,440
as though and football it's now renamed
also like like others that has renamed

85
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,259
to be don't have ps3 we now have review

86
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:59,399
and we would most of this stuff is
called no lawful interception

87
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:03,419
and and and yeah so that's the issue

88
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:08,830
come in all mmm naming applause is
becoming more more creative

89
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,279
a like a lotta a lot of liberties that
that that

90
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,330
America has in in in terms of first
amendment rights to speak about things

91
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,440
are now being repealed under a law
that's a what was it called the method

92
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,519
methamphetamine proliferation act I

93
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:27,849
which is a great name because a

94
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:31,659
you can't really protest the
methamphetamine proliferation act

95
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:34,958
at my you can but

96
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,289
I terrorist I can pick them up now they
can let

97
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:44,240
you cannot I'm up so these laws are
being

98
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,649
very creatively named and they have they
have crazy things and I'm

99
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:52,000
um this just every market I think I
think

100
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,860
some very very creative and cynical
people are working on the other side

101
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,870
at possibly some of these people

102
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,459
I remember being in in rooms like this
10

103
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,920
twelve years ago and talking about and

104
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,000
when in the Reagan era we sry SAR some
of these developments and we were

105
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,380
sitting

106
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,850
fantasizing about where this was all
headed and

107
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,829
a a lot of these fantasies were were
used pretty much

108
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:21,610
literally in in some of these laws that
have come out

109
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,370
so so I can't look at at that these
legal situations for instance the

110
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,750
British situation

111
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,970
I can't look at that and not feel some
sort of some sort of yet

112
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,850
no not fear a a it makes me it makes me
laugh

113
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,540
homestead its it's it's all ridiculous
and it's so ironic and so

114
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,099
that that I almost have to laugh I
almost have to admire that the cynicism

115
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,559
with which this is

116
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,360
being executed I'm I'm actually waiting
my favorite law that will come in like

117
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,010
2004-2005

118
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:57,529
is you have no idea how much industry
like the publishing industry and and and

119
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:01,569
how much they're paying politicians to
have all this legislation enacted

120
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:07,279
I huge sums and and it's really not that
large number of people on earth

121
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,970
I like as a sub pro-military the
population that are causing them to have

122
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,980
these lies

123
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:17,860
and acted and it's only fair that with
that we end up paying part of this cost

124
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,449
so the that corporate lobbying

125
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:24,449
legislation payment bill 2004

126
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:28,630
would actually get these people like
this John Johansson he needs to pay his

127
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,600
part

128
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,980
up the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
you have no idea what that cost to get

129
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,000
that acted

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,500
that's it my favorite cynical bit

131
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,100
up legislation which I'm expecting to be
enacted

132
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,380
no no but I i what i'm saying is is this
is

133
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,809
you yeah I might

134
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:53,459
know but but what i'm saying is we
should you I'll

135
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:57,980
a few years a you have to think ahead
you have to think ahead about what's

136
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,510
if this is the current situation what is
the worst they could do I'm not saying

137
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,470
we shouldn't

138
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,850
fantasize about that but you should take
these fantasies and and and

139
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,490
think about them really carefully
because they might become real

140
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,970
and you have to be a few years ahead I
don't know if that makes any sense but

141
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:20,500
to me it does any further

142
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:27,500
there yep

143
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:49,279
the Intel 33

144
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,170
it's already at the Intel p3

145
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,219
yeah I mean that thats past but the
question

146
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,640
in general is a growth the the question
of identification

147
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,080
and we we have to mention this some kind
of a very

148
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,530
huge lot a is a Terry discussion

149
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,670
out there around us cold e-commerce

150
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,939
and in that discussion there is

151
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,180
the government coming with her
suggestions like the digital signatures

152
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,270
which means people soul be identified

153
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,290
this does not really make sense for
electronic commerce

154
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,319
because someone who wants to trade
information or a good

155
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,610
he went to get the money he does not in
the first term care about he he selling

156
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,180
it to

157
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:43,080
he cares about getting paid and self
electronic transactions when we need

158
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,060
I would say is Digitel and a new miscast
and not digital signatures

159
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:53,400
but what the government says is people
make make contracts so if you if you

160
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,960
take it from a legal and theoretically

161
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,260
a perspective and take the pan to the
rub just mentioned

162
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,880
you can say oh those people make on
track so

163
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,400
they need to identify each other so they
can

164
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,870
aware those people to cart and

165
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,560
take the handcuffs a.m. and and and
stuff like that

166
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,930
we we we have to go to that discussions
also

167
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,210
because digital thicknesses are not only
a an overload where where where

168
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,490
government spent

169
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:26,790
a money which is simpler than could be
used for good projects

170
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,650
and but but also is is doing harm to
society cuz if they're

171
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,589
is a you too much personal and
identification

172
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:40,770
data out there there will be people you
think that pablo cell we know that

173
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,839
so if it's there people with it and we
we get a boy to

174
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,210
and sell stuff like that I think it's
very important that also

175
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:53,160
we either have to seeing go to the
discussions of computer security taking

176
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,500
place at a commercial places

177
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,900
and and and speak out loudly our ideas
and our point appears on that

178
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,810
because there's lots of companies like
like telecommunication carriers

179
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:09,810
who also have lots of problems and don't
like to integrate lawful interception

180
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,820
technology

181
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,370
but their problem is that they were on
the and Enda condition tho under

182
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,330
nondisclosure agreement they

183
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,740
they know all this bullshit but they
cannot speak out loud because they get

184
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,330
paid for not doing it

185
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:28,140
and and sell that situation I hopefully
we have had to seen

186
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,270
didn't do not getting into me this we
could close this session with

187
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,640
when held the whole congress started
here a

188
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,290
will was something about them please do
not sign an NDA its cuz

189
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:44,170
it makes you it makes you impossible to
not speak out what's happening

190
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,320
in and and I mean that's what what
hackers should

191
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,540
should be aware up them beget

192
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:58,540
try this

193
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,630
depends what what development you
talking about

194
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,450
I'm there's a number of things going on
in parallel there's there's control

195
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,970
the publishing industry which is
basically an industry middlemen

196
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,370
paying very little to whoever creates
content or

197
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:41,160
creative product and then getting a lot
of money from from the consumer's

198
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,270
the publishing industry is of course in
its own fight with the internet and and

199
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,680
this this whole global networking thing
that's happening

200
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,860
that's one thing and you the obvious

201
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,990
players in that %uh the movie houses the
the

202
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,550
the the big publishing companies a

203
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,260
then there's the this intelligence angle
there there's the the industry and

204
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,480
government spying on its citizens for
for corporate

205
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,130
intelligence for for political
intelligence I'm

206
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,330
so there's a lot of parallel
developments going on and

207
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,690
the big players in that are obviously
the ones that the make the most money

208
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,840
out of the existing situation continuing
as it is

209
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,390
I'm I'm not sure if that makes sense

210
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,800
at to give you a list at like these
companies are evil and these aren't

211
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:35,800
it depends what what issue with either
sorry

212
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:23,560
all

213
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:49,530
now

214
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,129
what what helps for me is is not is not
to look at that

215
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,290
current political situation as them in
us them is is

216
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,678
is as diverse as us them is is a bunch
of interests

217
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,090
which for a large part happened to point
in a negative direction

218
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,770
because at because that's where the
money is there because that's where the

219
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,918
economic interests are

220
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,030
but them is diverse and them can be

221
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,610
turned on themselves as easily as we can
be turned on ourselves

222
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,010
a so iight

223
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,790
I think it's not very productive to look
for the master plan or

224
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,590
or the evil leaders behind the screen
even though in some cases there are evil

225
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,928
evil plots behind the screens but to
look for percent to Pinterest Sweden

226
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:34,370
which may be pointing in the same
direction and to look for

227
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:39,730
ways to turn these interests onto each
other I'm

228
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,020
we're running out of time so I would
like to take one or two more questions

229
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,190
appointed there are any and then

230
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:52,190
wrap it up

231
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,019
well

232
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:47,889
II I don't see why you would get killed
for that I I agree completely I think a

233
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:48,940
lot of people agree

234
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,259
I'm the only thing you can do about

235
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:56,139
things like that drug you're talking
about in these kids that think they

236
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:56,559
really

237
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,039
is to widely published that this is
going on publish how it's being done and

238
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,249
teach people how to protect themselves
from it

239
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:08,419
and and try to dry attention to the fact
that the systems that are being set up

240
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:09,470
for have been set up

241
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,869
aren't securing a and that we I mean

242
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:15,908
credit card companies for instance

243
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:20,580
a the whole security of a credit card
transaction is that nobody knows this

244
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,158
number

245
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:25,509
a and and these credit card companies
have set up a

246
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:28,940
notoriously in secure system for all
these payments worldwide that are

247
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,570
happening

248
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,749
I'm their charging

249
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:36,789
have whatever happens in fraud they're
charging back on all of us

250
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:40,309
either as merchants are as as consumers
a

251
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:45,039
except for for the social cost of all
this crime that wouldn't otherwise be

252
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:45,789
occurring

253
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:48,908
a and their they're charging that back
on society

254
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:53,289
and never again on all of us so they
don't have any other burdens we get all

255
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:55,600
the burdens and they get all the profit
a

256
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,090
had had we not accepted that as a
society have beautiful

257
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,658
screw you got a picture on problems if
you you if you call this a secure system

258
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:07,190
if you think this is how payments are
going to work in a networked society

259
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,350
well then you deal with the problems you
pay for the law enforcement

260
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,950
a and you can charge any that right back
on I'm

261
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,909
on your on your consumers are on on the
people that are using your system you'll

262
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:19,450
just have to pay out for that

263
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,440
out of profits at then that would have
been long fixed

264
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,789
so we're at what else can we do but

265
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:30,869
but to draw attention to these problems
and and and try to use the fact that we

266
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:32,189
know how this is done

267
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:38,730
in in teaching other people one more

268
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:45,730
there

269
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,919
breaking the legs works

270
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,730
intellectually

271
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,100
no way add a lot ever since I started
out as a script kiddie except it wasn't

272
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,870
called that

273
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:38,070
but a I I'm not proud of a lot of things
I did when I was like 14 15 years old

274
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,649
and

275
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,980
learning all this technology but it was
it was my way above

276
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:47,070
student pissing off people in power are
pissing off people that were

277
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:50,290
I'm and I was talking to a room for love

278
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,720
military brass in in washington at some
point

279
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,830
and they were you were trying to
understand this hacker thing and and and

280
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,210
why are you doing this

281
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,990
as a general isn't a when when all you
were young

282
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,760
a and and of course you all were very
good but a lot of kids

283
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,179
a were trying to piss of older people
cuz that's just what young kids do

284
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:15,090
and all they needed to do with Swizz
wear their hair long

285
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,570
or or a at walk around with

286
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,139
with the vietnam sticker on the on on
their bike or car whatever

287
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,740
and and that would be enough to piss of
older people

288
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,419
right now hacking into military systems
is pretty much the only thing you can

289
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,260
still do as a fourteen fifteen-year-old

290
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:36,720
to piss you guys of a and and

291
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,980
that's it works I never mean that's
that's

292
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,020
a I think I think it's part of human
development that's how we learn that's

293
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,570
how we

294
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:49,399
a find our place in society whether it's
with a spraycan art

295
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,440
a lot of people just have a period where
they with a case other people are

296
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,270
and we have to we have to bend of course
we have to try to bend that into more

297
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,490
productive ways it pissing them off

298
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,890
but I don't think love

299
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:06,840
kiddies are a break in three sizes just
as a way for bailing

300
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,799
love kitties all will break into
military sites because its Koo

301
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,970
and the that makes you think that elite
its

302
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,470
its more down to try to look big and try
and make yourself

303
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,630
what field one look powerful and there
is that

304
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:28,630
it's gone there's a buzz is great in a
his kid we have to share his peers

305
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:39,340
right and and that the point that

306
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,549
in other words we got issue

307
00:25:56,549 --> 00:26:00,570
you know when you gonna show these kids
