the halls behind-the-scenes factor the
MTV thing so I'm gonna talk about what

9
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:10,920
it was like to

10
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,470
be a participant in when these wonderful
hackers

11
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,590
fronted the media may try to document
what it's all about

12
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,860
and may bring some contacts with us
things

13
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,479
involving %ah tammy has the inside scoop
and

14
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,780
he knows the most about it so why don't
you recap for people who didn't see

15
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,240
exactly how bad it was

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,210
K basically if anyone saw the travesty
data and TV

17
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,190
did put on I am I no longer work for MTV
obviously anymore

18
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:44,950
by the basically be shows showcased
three-year so hackers

19
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,880
all teenagers I basically true-life
series

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,158
on it look like a road rules packing
basically

21
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,640
I Asia 8 you know throw in the real
world in

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,130
whatever that show is on a night where
everyone has sex in each others

23
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,869
basically

24
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,040
is as horrible media catching idea I

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,190
the way it started I

26
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,980
way back land I guess it was a year and
a half to correct me if I'm wrong

27
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,369
but I there's a miramax protest I'll
where we protested for

28
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,320
the sick kevin Mitnick and the whole I
takedown movie

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,739
well what happened was

30
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:26,959
I went up 10 TV and I said I got an idea

31
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,070
for show here I why don't you do a thing
on kevin Mitnick n

32
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,850
show how their really not paying
attention to his rights at all

33
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,769
and kinda I showcase the media in that
aspect so they start working on it

34
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:45,549
90 Isaac was an idiot a lot of us were
interviewed

35
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:49,340
on the evening came to 2600 meetings I

36
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,290
they'll really doing good spy cam
playing I government and hackers and

37
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,929
the whole scene arm events

38
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,750
it took a wrong tack and I don't know
who did this I

39
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,579
I'm not kept claw lakes Serena Altschul
was 12 people

40
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:10,680
Anthony lapaille I think his last name
iz I'll list the other producer on it

41
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,130
they both somehow came up with this idea
of dropping all the footage

42
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,060
on the drop the footage I love all the
long known

43
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,419
hackers in the scene pretty much I lost

44
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:27,199
had 52nd spy I'll

45
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,590
2600 inhabit anything and pretty much

46
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,260
I'll they were given credit at the end
which was funny

47
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,620
I am I didn't have a spot net den mother
name

48
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,620
angst sure why came out a bit

49
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,590
I am any dimension kevin Mitnick at all

50
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,290
they had some real good footage FBI
footage I

51
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,519
basically they took

52
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,570
three actors I shamrock mantis

53
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:03,010
and chameleon if you know them I to have
them are not so long on the ramp arse

54
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,060
I chameleon well-known for

55
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,570
getting busted I'll by to

56
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,608
basically what happened was

57
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:17,310
shamrock had this idea chief all Mt

58
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:23,130
I he said that he was going to take this
desk

59
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,430
hide it at a friends place go over there
and leave MTV and this season and is

60
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,250
actually

61
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,580
it looks stupid on TV but the day after
he gave this big public apology

62
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,840
and said I'm sorry but I had to do it

63
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,130
it singles party loyalty he actually
want to delete MTV

64
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,500
all we had to a parking lot like you
know like out names some military base

65
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,050
have all these white cars pull up and
Lake

66
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,379
for 10 he gets busted in making a huge
media that well

67
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,970
MTV wasn't willing to go to that lank

68
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,740
they'd like stop following August's
crazy cell

69
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,280
they aired this product any news just

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,639
literally like you know crap that was
just a

71
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,970
like big ball crap share my pics at this
apology

72
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:16,750
it gets free air after this apology and
slick

73
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,490
AP if I fall down of the stage

74
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,710
unlike you played over and over again
his like again the ratings

75
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,150
so basically they did it down and I 10
Selina

76
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:33,169
I said by display that MTV's being made
fools of

77
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:37,419
you just were basically light till and
you're showing me oh we got caught

78
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:44,419
up bill I to and she said no he lied to
all the hackers out there

79
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:48,960
cell basically that's what wrapped up
with the hacker shell

80
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,900
and from my idea from takedown protest
hey

81
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,069
turned into this MTV year old rules I
real-world take the

82
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:02,219
crap and then put on anti need for
everyone to see

83
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:05,729
that's what basically happened on

84
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:09,560
well as a purchase been the show I would
say we are pretty duped into a the whole

85
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,419
thing was going to be about

86
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:14,669
and this isn't Mike this was our first
documentary

87
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:18,599
the loft has been five or six
documentaries before rain

88
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:22,030
ranging from small things like and Lisa
savages

89
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,389
unauthorized access to things by the BBC

90
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,969
a let recently one by any networks

91
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:32,069
they call the heat error

92
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:36,650
but so you know we were pretty
experience what's %uh singer

93
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,240
reporters before and figuring out what
the hell they're gonna talk about

94
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,710
because we don't want to be at a

95
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,789
basically involves show this is all
about from no behavior

96
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:48,949
you know we want people to really
understand the message what happens all

97
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:49,520
about

98
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,599
questioning technology and exploring

99
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:55,870
and and wanna a lot of things that
motivate us

100
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,599
on so

101
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:04,219
what we did was which we do with a lot
about a lot a lot a lot of these

102
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:04,729
meetings

103
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:08,849
we try to tried it try to interview the
produces the writers before the thing

104
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:09,878
happens

105
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,379
and try to figure out what their
messages

106
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:17,270
and actually getting email to have the
code here from

107
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,340
at the Lafayette was one other wanted
the

108
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,150
the producers and that this is this is
how we started out like

109
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,879
what what they're gonna do with the show
he said quote our goal is to give a

110
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,430
balanced informed look

111
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,729
at hackers and hacker culture so

112
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:38,159
mom if anyone was more informed about
this

113
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:44,219
I it was definitely MTV I think I manual
idea 2010 people spent days talking with

114
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:44,960
them

115
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,830
I know we spent a full day at the lodge
showing them

116
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,669
about hacker culture what we do on

117
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:56,859
and they basically chose a completely
completely ignore it

118
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,060
I mean its its it's practically criminal
that they just completely

119
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,569
completely ignore reality any college
documentary

120
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:07,949
supposed to be a documentary so you
gonna research something

121
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:12,689
and can you find out facts and then you
just completely ignore them a slant the

122
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:13,669
story

123
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:18,539
yes basically lying fraud I

124
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,998
Sosa some stuff we we we we talked about
them

125
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:27,289
with was a lot of things we we play with
little at the loft we talked about Tom

126
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:30,568
a lot of our hardware hacking link with
mobile data terminals

127
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,570
and packet radio verse engineering
modifying cell phones

128
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,560
pack pagers talked about

129
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,419
some the tools we ran a lot of practice
postpone our abilities

130
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:47,510
and basically they they ignore that the
52nd clip they had a bus

131
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,420
which was a lot more than they did for
2600 people who I think spent a lot more

132
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,770
time

133
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,240
with them on basically I

134
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,170
I think the clip showed me I playing
with my laptop connected to a scanner

135
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:01,670
showing

136
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,029
a kid to intercept the a car's traffic
Obama

137
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:09,250
and watch the allocation to the planes
are coming in at the airport

138
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,360
and then they thought was a big deal
that we could tune into

139
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,250
of bosnian radio over shortwave

140
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,910
yourself they were very very clueless

141
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:26,639
completely clueless and sometimes no
matter how much education you try to do

142
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,940
I if the people are dumb it's just

143
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,209
doesn't matter you know i mean some
people just don't get it

144
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:36,680
and no matter what we did it seem like
they just couldn't get

145
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,790
even knowing their mind they thought
they were being balanced and they were

146
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,230
going to be informed

147
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,470
because they had some idea that that's
what journalists supposed to do

148
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,019
om they just can't seem to have the
capability of he

149
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,680
understanding and if the person can
understand

150
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,089
dan you your son I am

151
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:00,820
so you know we find this all the time
with the media

152
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,079
on a lot times I just a just can't
understand in after

153
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,550
like doing these things for space is
leased MTV thing

154
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,829
the cat make a jaded about it I

155
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:16,430
but I i think there are things we can do

156
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,920
to as all other reasons that we

157
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,130
week at the loft wanna do these things
besides like the fun

158
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,600
Gloria me on MTV is because we actually
think

159
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,899
that we're gonna educate like young
impressionable people about

160
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:33,529
reality as opposed to yet another story

161
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:37,920
about you know some someone's idea
packets actually

162
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,709
educating into reality and

163
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:46,220
it never seems that to work very well

164
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,699
so I think that

165
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:54,339
people actually have to just basically
go outside to me in a lot of ways

166
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:57,980
I think white job twice and it's doing
with them

167
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,180
freedom downtime is exactly the right
thing to do I mean it's hard to cost

168
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,810
money

169
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,050
but it's really the only way to do so
many things and that's one of the

170
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,949
reasons we started our aging and happy
news network

171
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:12,899
was to have an alternative voice and out
the technology today

172
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,579
it's easy to have that alternative voice
attrition out of work does a great job

173
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:17,329
having it

174
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:20,380
I'll term boys in debunking all all the
media stuff

175
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,139
I am so I think those are things that

176
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,329
does mg type thing is is gonna continue
to happen

177
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:32,459
who is it was really funny 2008
energetic but I am

178
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:36,750
the is in attaining the fact the MTV
actually

179
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,199
listen to what people are saying on the
outside too because

180
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,690
when the show finally went to this
produced can't hang in the showed it to

181
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,399
me

182
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,490
what did i do I went flat my big mouth
to every act right now and send

183
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,620
by god did you see this day all I got

184
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,310
and I I wanted epcot I last year

185
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:01,110
and I i talked to the parse Cashin said
you know what they're showing here you

186
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,670
guys are that like headliners

187
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:07,800
you look like crap and I called of the
holotype to giving updates saying hey

188
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,730
you know what they're doing whatever
like that

189
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,389
it came back to Lake

190
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:17,000
you know like my desk saying you know
you talkin shit about the show any

191
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,100
gets crap filled with came out was just
like this

192
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,620
do is this de gaulle for like the teeny
bopper kids who can

193
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,380
now say no ice on HX ice on the MTV
thing

194
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,680
I think I'm call of the day get me a
computer and

195
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,509
my AOL account still greater numbers
I'll

196
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:40,579
it's basically come to that vehicle with
MTV where everything is sensationalism

197
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:44,079
are shocked value any basically this is
one reason why

198
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,720
the show does do you like he's sexy
nineties programs and you can see to

199
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,209
pick daddy's go on the town and
scorching young girls in church

200
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:55,759
I it's just attention that mentality

201
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,540
doing a computer show I network like
that it wasn't

202
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,469
aviso lose-lose situation no matter wat
which way you looked at itself

203
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,610
basically in

204
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,870
I don't think that they have a plan to
do something smart

205
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,019
a day actually they wanted to generate
revenue

206
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,690
that's only reason I know the actually
day

207
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,399
definitely

208
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,399
so and yes much more said yes

209
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,880
questions about

210
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,980
about doing is media thanks yeah and

211
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,220
we have a question back there you I
stepped to the microphone

212
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:44,100
take Raleigh area

213
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,709
hey releasing to you she trusts a user
TV media

214
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:51,940
because as you see what happened with
MTV it's unclear on this story and

215
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,699
immediate

216
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:56,470
to look like oh crap but when you look
at like the newspapers acute your

217
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,810
tacitly supported Dida CSS

218
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,480
texting I think you should a looking to

219
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,329
other forms me licking newspapers and
reuse which

220
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:10,089
which actually doing actually should
check the truth or don't sensor eating

221
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:10,860
them

222
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,279
to that extent the TV does and
Cincinnati particular corporation

223
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,040

251
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,670
watching a car wreck

253
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,649

beat the shit out somebody I recommend

256
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,390
watching a Krzyzewski

257
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:24,459
so angry how they portray like now like
whenever you see the word hacker to

258
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:25,170
somebody

259
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:30,010
I mean like my mom knows like cool on
the computer I know whatever

260
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,750
but teaching I G one example like one
other segments

261
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,899
they had as a mantis was oMG showing

262
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,910

play it

264
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,709
you know I mean if he's downloaded the
MH exceed our the matrix and he was

265
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,560
playing and and and serene was like

266
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,560
who that is so cool that you can do that
like he is so lonely skill

267
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,779
key okay are you are you okay

268
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:00,070
you know that every night is lot and
that's not the low point I mean that

269
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,320
that's basically

270
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,220
you know that that was one segment up
what was exciting and then

271
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,740
then not Serena like top at the very end
the show I think she had a caps lock key

272
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,300
stock she's trying to log into AOL

273
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,959
the she said first account had been
hacked

274
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,530
and she was as she actually said email
asking for advice on what she should do

275
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:28,030
where has she send email she can't get
into AOL asking questions now

276
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,040
by I am sorry I used to call me all the
time as her

277
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,960
resident helper can get hang I she

278
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,040
she's a good friend of mine I and talk
to her I have no qualms with her

279
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,620
it's just the way she runs her best the
way MTV runs its business

280
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,530
but she must die in

281
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:52,960
89 wheres you know he say our computer
hacker much broke in my computer

282
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,910
because I produced this segment so
they're all after me

283
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,480
which the any MTV's network is pretty
secure

284
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,660
alone I mean MTV runs really secure
network

285
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,960
I and the law say well

286
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:14,020
fines yes personal email accounts it's
not what days from now

287
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,980
the I'm that's how she's able sendmail
by Tom she

288
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,919
she is that wow all I would say I don't
know in other words don't like excitable

289
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:27,770
about things like watching a major turn
your laptop artesian well with shamrock

290
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,360
in his car

291
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,460
as he listens to police frequencies on a
scanner moved

292
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,700
buoyed by you know like you think these
people never heard a radio shack before

293
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,580
I and I also had one comment on the last
comment

294
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,020
on you can't really generalized that

295
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,690
all TV media as bad and all newspaper
media is good

296
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,360
because like look at john markoff he
works for the New York Times

297
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,240
I don't agree actually said here no

298
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,559
I just saying what that kid was saying
shirt did

299
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,220
TV media can be bad I recently did a
meeting with my group with the NBC

300
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,210
for here in the city which Exxaro and we
sat for like

301
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,960
shoot three hours with them talking
about serious issues

302
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,960
and the only pieces that they put on TV
us

303
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,440
is fact that I got busted and some
another member of the group

304
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,800
also broke into a system and these guys
to sensational part of it

305
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,840
dished did a spin on it though they say
we're hackers working in the

306
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,899
did a sector as

307
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:36,140
white hat people in the past year black
cap and now we've collected ourselves

308
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,150
which was totally wrong say about us
anyway they made abroad that

309
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,840
generalization up what we do

310
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,320
but they didn't smear ass but it showed
that the media is out there to get one

311
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:45,870
thing

312
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,419
and one thing only 50 the fact that
people are gonna watch it

313
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:53,500
and it was put on 10 sweeps week by the
way so it shows you what

314
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,040
to meet his plan was do you think the
media will ever get it right

315
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,200
not now I don't think they can really
understand

316
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,659
they just don't think they understand
that's why we have to tell the story

317
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:12,659
by Voice without air filter on it and I
if there's anyone out there I'm not

318
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,059
since I'm up here I'm not gonna
propagated by Tom

319
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:20,110
it so what's actually in code

320
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,740
the MTV show after a link up I'll link
it to our page

321
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,380
you know but I i'm not to put it up
since there and could be legal problems

322
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,600
yep

323
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,679
fresh I could you but

324
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,140
a.m. could you comment on jonbenet's
bitches role as technical consultant

325
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:46,919
okay again the MTV people are ignorant
douche

326
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,520
I am an immediate comment on that
morning

327
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,530
of sheik I'm I can add names here

328
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,070
I'll but MTV

329
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,158
can grab the people who are out there
and the media I think

330
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:05,470
and GP's 12 people whose out and the
media

331
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,040
I pretty widely I'll

332
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,600
site feel that's the only reason that he
got on there whether or not he did a

333
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,300
good job

334
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:19,580
it is just that that shamrock deal yeah
I am like

335
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,770
I just I I don't understand even

336
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,970
people who went it just looks so cheesy
some guys staying up against a blue

337
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,940
stain pretty high as shit like

338
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,210
lecturing about security any it seems so
hollywood

339
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:36,790
so I'll I a really don't have a good
comment about it so I'll leave it at

340
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,470
that

341
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,610
discussion the back there mention one
thing quickly

342
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,820
I regarding the times comment what you
have to keep in mind is that anthony

343
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,860
loves day

344
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,050
who was the fellow who kinda I soon was
called in for this are somehow related

345
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,129
and we know how we get related

346
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,280
did a piece for the times in which he
interviewed

347
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,700
3 hackers two of which were shamrock

348
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,740
and mantis so its he's already

349
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,830
been in print with these particular
individuals in which is why I think you

350
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,290
approach them for the show

351
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,850
they decide to scrap all the rest the
stuff that we gave games like

352
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,059
it's interesting you mention this guy
because I'm before we

353
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:19,020
you got involved in this I did a little
research just see like is there any

354
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,139
real journalism behind this thing and
the guy

355
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,300
you know he has a degree from Columbia
school journalism

356
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,280
he's written specials for the your time
so it's like well you must be real

357
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,470
journalists

358
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,620
but you know you just can't really tell
what's gonna happen and serena is

359
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,500
actually

360
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,620
up very well voiced also she's won
awards when she was like 14 for news

361
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,649
agencies out in california

362
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:46,190
so any in there pretty good reporters
before they came to this thing but

363
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,010
.me.uk you're looking at a channel that
was all music

364
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,440
and then started playing shows I'm
because they had to put some filler oh

365
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,390
my god

366
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,230
kind of music let's put real-world a
it's just

367
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,909
it become a ninja and what do they do
after that the spin-off

368
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:05,919
make em to you which you can only get on
satellite now

369
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,610
but what about MTV no music you know in
our

370
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,330
actually MTV does play music I between
10 in the morning

371
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:17,470
then it's like Beach MTV real world

372
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,909
Russian a I think that the
generalization at

373
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:24,200
on TV media is bad is and

374
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,020
pad translation a it's nice

375
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,710
I would actually this is awesome little
generalizing

376
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,220
it mostly happens in the United States
because

377
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,020
you have the giant media conglomerates
who

378
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,918
of course their soul reason for being is
to make money

379
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:46,100
only they can get money is by getting
like

380
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,620
you know the little people to watch that
no papers and kids

381
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,820
or delors

382
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:59,000
by hey

383
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,500
hick a

384
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,040
but some in a lot of the European and
foreign countries

385
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,899
its state media which times is bad too

386
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:14,800
but a it's mostly about just journalism

387
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,690
the CIA de ahi EA you're absolutely
correct and so the shows that we've been

388
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,220
involved in with the BBC

389
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,510
with aidid history the Internet CBC did
it did a show on privacy

390
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,179
which is a qAME broadcasting company and
then sings lead on

391
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:31,330
for for the gym where newshour PBS

392
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,550
it seems like the state-run stops
actually

393
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:39,490
more truthful yeah and also in the US
you do have to live

394
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:44,020
government involvement in media sorry to
have to cover me

395
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,360
and proper stamping things the

396
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,919
yes in Stayner state-owned media you do
but there isn't that whole big thing

397
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:58,050
where the US like Jim Canada isn't
pretending to be like the policemen and

398
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:01,220
of the world on Sunday

399
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,530
really don't have they don't have that
fear

400
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,940
me also a lot of other countries like
the US has

401
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,000
biggest incarceration moral

402
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,040
because I've lost like happy paranoia

403
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,800
make that at okay

404
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,070
okay like people are saying that this is
all the media's fault for getting the

405
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,689
whole hacker thing

406
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,929
you get a bunch fourteen-year-old kids
calling themselves hackers

407
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:33,720
going with this whole image and giving
the media this image

408
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,389
just look at the MTV special this kid
mantis is calling himself a hacker

409
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:41,690
down the matrix he's not accurate
Postmedia supposed to know when the

410
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,340
whole

411
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,389
hacker community can't find what is
really a hacker

412
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:50,230
Italy breaks into systems is somebody
just eyes or hair different colors

413
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:53,700
in these technicals detainee configured
are you

414
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,659
a play you

415
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:01,460
figure out I'll what you are going to
find to be a hacker and I can't let

416
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,270
these kids go around calling themselves
hackers

417
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,830
you just downloading scripts well I
think what we're doing here is talking

418
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,168
about how

419
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:11,899
you know these people were called
hackers by someone else we don't have

420
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:12,940
control over

421
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,389
to MTV calls hackers we spent 2010 isbn:
days

422
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:20,899
90 la spent a few days informing these
people

423
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:24,659
but we can't you know we don't have
strings I can control them what they say

424
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:29,550
actress all we can do is trying to tell
people what the real story is

425
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:34,320
but the problem is that the media can
make a decision to not listen to us

426
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,178
so that's why saying about earlier that
we have to do our own media like what

427
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:38,690
stuff

428
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:44,139
play with your freedom downtime
attrition died or capping news network

429
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:47,889
we need more that you're you're you're
right by Tom

430
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:51,050
you know that just look there's not
really much we can do when

431
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:54,678
won a place like MTV decisis let the
story one way you know what control do

432
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,260
we have

433
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,580
who they call hackers well what we can
do is to announce it as you doing

434
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,810
and institutions also bring up the point
that it

435
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:06,850
skit katie is going out there calling
themselves hacker and you're not

436
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:13,850
um dance that also hmmm down

437
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:23,408
has the lofty 2600 a result about suing
MTV for libel in a class action lawsuit

438
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:27,020
in terms you know destroying the truth

439
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,710
accurate I don't know if you can do that
reaction to it in libelous

440
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,600
they did libeled I mean if it's an error
omission is very little

441
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,470
you can do you know if they have fax in
the choose not to report them

442
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:43,139
that's bad journalism it's not illegal

443
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:46,159
way things avalanche decides MTV sleep

444
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:51,240
lawyers and I me eighty it's not like
they call up somebody like a

445
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,370
shoe minutes you may hello we need to
see somebody

446
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:58,990
they have a whole floor lawyers so it's
not like even if you wanted the Battle

447
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,590
Angel like that

448
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:04,050
and you might have a chance you know but
literally its

449
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,280
a would be hard the the other issue is I

450
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,080
there's difference between media as in
MTV or media as in news

451
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,530
media is an and TV is an entertainment
company

452
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:19,730
news is news that's St runt a project

453
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,860
so showing interviews yet news like
killed Billy Bob in your neighbor gets

454
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,389
hit by a car

455
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:28,700
ball it okay to whom do you do fire

456
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,720
and you look stupid as hell is your
pants down think broadcast all they want

457
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,080
because

458
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,780
its use worthy but prolly MTV is

459
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,889
its entertainment so therefore they have
lawyers and they have all these

460
00:28:39,889 --> 00:28:40,669
contracts

461
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:43,810
you sign when you participate in such an
act

462
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:47,860
because they had they get paid for it
it's a money-making engine

463
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,030
in the difference between news and
entertainment is whether

464
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,428
you really like even documentaries are
entertainment a lot away if you ever

465
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:56,379
been interviewed by real news

466
00:28:56,379 --> 00:28:59,440
organization you don't have to sign a
release form

467
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,889
if it's real news there's no release
form they have a right to tell that

468
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:03,750
story

469
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,139
if it's something which is entertainment
you have to sign a release saying it's

470
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:08,070
okay

471
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:12,500
to use my image Obama actually a
difference is actually very little

472
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,409
real news awesome it is entertaining

473
00:29:17,409 --> 00:29:22,139
at what are the disadvantages that any
subcultural group local organizations

474
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:23,159
going to face

475
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,659
is misrepresentation in news media um

476
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:30,070
the reason that MTV is going to show
always

477
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,600
certain segments up a quote unquote
hacker or any other subculture

478
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,120
is that that's going to be what people
are interested in seeing

479
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,860
people watch dateline NBC and in TV
specials

480
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,669
because its interests something it's
something that they don't understand

481
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:48,970
but to show what happened julie is all
nannies

482
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:53,820
socio-political group actually is it's
going to be pretty boring is media-savvy

483
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,100
arm if any one group wants to change its
image

484
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,700
improve it you have to make what you're
doing six years so that that is

485
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,740
interesting

486
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,480
make the at the people actually here say
can you sing alter tops

487
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,020
I do not take this thing up

488
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,320
okay noticed the average

489
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,820
percent on the street that does not have
any interest and the internals

490
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,939
UNIX or network security isn't gonna
understand what

491
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,490
what people do on a day-to-day basis
that you hack systems well i hack

492
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,179
we have to do is you have to make it
real to them and show them their

493
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:30,679
vulnerability is doing things like

494
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:33,810
online banking show show how the stuff
that we're dealing with

495
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,740
actually affects their lives information
that we have to give in the way that we

496
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,070
E we explore week sort of our counter
balance against a proprietary systems

497
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,320
technology show how how what we're doing
actually affects their

498
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,889
der der generalized they really need
people like us

499
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:53,710
many people to question must money
caveats to that

500
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:57,040
on is if you're showing the
vulnerabilities at the system's

501
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,470
you're not showing the people are going
to say I'll need to get you to help us

502
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,679
get rid of these

503
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,360
dear Danny vilified as being evil for
having this information

504
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,470
well just like to say the government has
this information and has the ability to

505
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:13,260
do obviously it is now is that it's a
lot of his privacy related stuff where

506
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,010
when you it when you expose these
privacy issues

507
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:19,500
you're you're not the bad guy either
something that is an aspect

508
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,470
that up I think it and the popular
culture is going to be like

509
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:27,559
fight show my mom that I can sniffer
password hashes

510
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:30,770
taking information online banking she's
gonna freak out

511
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:34,379
but if I A show her is reception he
didn't make

512
00:31:34,379 --> 00:31:37,970
to do to make sure that doesn't happen
and then show her

513
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:42,460
that it is possible it's better it's
it's just a different spin on how on how

514
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,139
you

515
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:46,139
disseminate information out there

516
00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:50,649
thanks

517
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:53,960
process was sane I'm an outsider it on a
shamrock I don't really know and people

518
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,790
have produced

519
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:57,918
parser if it still around reproduce it
now

520
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,030
but I do believe that we need is kinda
outlets that the technologies enabling

521
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,428
us to do this

522
00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:07,159
my question mark comment is a I felt to

523
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,720
sick to my stomach when I saw think that
the thing I felt worse about

524
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,540
%uh was won the lines in the van I got
into hacking for all the wrong reasons

525
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,178
and how I hold shamrock personally
responsible for a lot of this

526
00:32:19,179 --> 00:32:22,970
on I know you're being a louisiana we
don't have to do that dog anybody out

527
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:23,740
there

528
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,710
you know was he there to really lead
them on a chase

529
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,889
was he there to promote parse and when
things went bad

530
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:34,490
he tried that you know have this alibi
and I don't think we should

531
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,879
you know parse could bend really great
they had their the

532
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:41,389
the viewership I didn't really think the
that a lot content

533
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:44,700
that I was interested in but I was
sporting a

534
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,010
and we had links on our page and we were
like while these guys really doing stuff

535
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,250
they have a budget the camera crews

536
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:53,560
and all the sudden you know this because
they did something

537
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,480
that we rarely get they became
hypocrites and they lost all that

538
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,830
so this one avenue that we had our
outlet you know

539
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:05,139
self-destructed and and I don't I'm not
sure if you know anything about what

540
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:05,820
happened but

541
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,540
I don't buy it personally I'll

542
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,780
I i kno shamrock enough I've hung out
with shamrock

543
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,080
and I'm not today slander in any way

544
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,790
I'll the guy but we are specific tend
Freaknik

545
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,310
I last year together and he's gonna fly
down with me

546
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:28,359
any just slate you know somehow he

547
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:32,070
got up late or something like that
missed his flight I met the show's

548
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,020
producer

549
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:37,099
down there who interviewed me and also
asked me if I wanted a job

550
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:40,389
mom his job was in jeopardy than

551
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:43,720
and if you've seen parse towards the end

552
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,659
shamrock is no longer a member parses of
forgive me I don't know her name in it

553
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:49,260
she's here

554
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,490
feel really bad but someone else these
excuse me

555
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:56,649
my crash yet thanks

556
00:33:56,649 --> 00:34:01,750
streak

557
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,500
no it's not Erica yep in regards to the

558
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,639
the second generation parcels actually
guessed whites

559
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,929
news Allen thank you and Sun

560
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:16,109
unfortunately I think the damage was
done and at that point

561
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:20,418
where now granted they're not the only
media outlet you can hear me off the

562
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:20,848
hook

563
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:26,089
twos and I say WBAI I

564
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:30,149
shameless plug picked up yet it was

565
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:33,569
I was called in as a guest twice but
really at that point I think the damage

566
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,230
was done

567
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:39,050
and people were just disgusted with it
if you look at sctv now

568
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,839
I I believe they have what four channels
I

569
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:46,859
which shows you in the beginning they
had like 30 forty channels

570
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:51,779
I wanna being is tech TDA believe the
URL was

571
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,530
date they did have a lot to content and
they did have a lot of computer contact

572
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:59,369
when things you gotta realize immediate
I'll I'll a UNIX shell prompt

573
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:03,450
is not interesting to the consumer ale
never be

574
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:06,689
no want to see a look overlook bash

575
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:11,270
not gonna give to rats ass but you show
them something major see

576
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,540
I can bring up this display I mean look
at the movie hackers

577
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,609
any just imagine you sure that to a
viewer it makes

578
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:22,430
money show someone a documentary forgive
me for all the CDC people who might be

579
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,730
here but I'll

580
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,540
disinformation it was a fifteen minute
movie

581
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,980
they sold it but it was doable online
the only people watch it where hackers

582
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,660
so there's there's a means to an end
there where its it's only gonna be out

583
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,279
there if it's sensationalism

584
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,599
where not the hackers have to change

585
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:44,109
is a question to that can't be answered
right now

586
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:47,390
a media sure is not going to change
because they are a money-making engine

587
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:53,348
that's all they're ever gonna be

588
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:57,040
steer quick note and I think that this
may be timely given that their

589
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,020
or a number for TV cameras and
microphones and such prowling around

590
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,070
trains reference to on

591
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:08,109
that really watch what you say are

592
00:36:08,109 --> 00:36:12,359
to everyone especially the media because
they do like to

593
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:16,140
at it and I experience this personally I
don't use your number my face from the

594
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,098
beginning in the show

595
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:20,260
yes by your as I mentioned sorry got

596
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,430
yes but I michael's yes on

597
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,529
but I they didn't really make me look
like a fool man

598
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:31,240
if you remember the what I said after
that the edited out of course not

599
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,540
training exercise a bit of a personal
responsibility but

600
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:38,830
just not everyone to make sure that you
don't say anything that could be clipped

601
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,348
in

602
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:42,730
added to make you look look a fool

603
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,910
destructive figure in what have you

604
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:49,700
thanks not something that happens mean I
you know they're going to take to bits

605
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,200
and pieces

606
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,430
when you're approached by the media more
often than not

607
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:58,149
they've already got the story in mind
and they're just looking for quotes from

608
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,520
you

609
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,280
sound bites from you that are going to
she'll and in progress it towards that

610
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,490
point that they're going to try to make
it was possible journalism

611
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,570
I would tend to think not because it be
ignoring

612
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:14,220
the mash tell frances was really came to
WBAI

613
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,150
I had no idea she was gonna show up
because I usually have no idea what's

614
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,350
happening with that show in general

615
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,500
I she shows up we go off into

616
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,710
to a room and we just talked for hours
and

617
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,530
you note that the basic E the basic
questions that we got to our motivation

618
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,300
why do you hack

619
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,230
things like that which are always the
classics and they're completely ignored

620
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,980
now granted I'm

621
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,820
very happy not appeared anywhere in at
MTV peace in fact it was fairly nervous

622
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,960
looking at the little

623
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,680
thumbnail sized photos on the website
but

624
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,220
the eighty to talk to media realize it
there

625
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,270
there approaching this already in their
mind they have an idea of what they want

626
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,140
the article to be

627
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:58,029
and just just be careful about what you
say they did have the

628
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:01,160
they did come in the 2600 meetings a lot
tale

629
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,480
actually got kicked out at the citicorp
building castillo sign it

630
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,900
yet as an email after that how do we
measure to permit for a sequel

631
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,990
day out into the security but they had
told you the subculture

632
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,330
I mean they they had to lax 28 they
talked a lot of people

633
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:20,860
they did make an effort I alright talk
to Selena

634
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,670
about the cutting room floor and all the
studies show it was just tolley pushed

635
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,360
aside

636
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,370
I her answer was it was inherent was
Anthony

637
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:31,779
so I am sure if I posit Anthony

638
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:35,380
it is you know where brother and sister
there something and I'll

639
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,440
I but basically they did have access
that page

640
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,700
widely ignored it motivation on your

641
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,190
hando I I don't know why I

642
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:50,700
just have a couple points but is best

643
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,650
people pretty much sums almost except
for that sexy thing

644
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:58,890
I think that that is the entirely wrong
with think about it to think that we

645
00:38:58,890 --> 00:38:59,680
have to go

646
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,750
to other media and make what we do look
sexy for them

647
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,120
people are going to be interested in
UNIX shell probs solution is your

648
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,880
responsibility to make a mission

649
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,300
so responsibly to put our own content

650
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,240
make our own films but you don't publish
magazines and things like that

651
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,390
in deal activity in presenting what we
want presented about us not to find

652
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,160
somebody else

653
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,390
because we could sit here all day in
argue within a television

654
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:30,930
this television reporter is a real news
reporter that newspaper writers real

655
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:31,350
news

656
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:35,160
writer in it certainly gives anyway so

657
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,080
I don't think that we should be striving
to make it look sexy to them a try to

658
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,370
come up with the sound bite that they'll
be able to use that

659
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:45,759
he won't make us look bad because I
don't think you can blame in TV for what

660
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,400
they did

661
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,790
they're gonna take all the food is a
hand in it at the way they think

662
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:54,200
looks like a news story there do not
knowledgeable that it's an action to say

663
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,100
well this part makes them look dead and
this poor makes them look good they're

664
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,720
gonna say

665
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,280
all this part sounds good on TV and
that's when I saw it

666
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,520
about them the whole time and that's the
thing is wear them

667
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,640
to the news media so we should be
actively trying to do our own thing

668
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,970
and and eventually it'll

669
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:17,820
you know by osmosis hopefully someday to
be somebody

670
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,800
fear that money have some you know good
idea of what's going on

671
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,370
well this is what I'm using where
basically they were interested in

672
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,580
grabbing eyeballs

673
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,630
here advertisers gonna do most
socialistic thing they can do

674
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:35,240
I got a rhetorical question I how many
people see National Geographic magazine

675
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,860
how many people actually read it any

676
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,650
its H where you gonna do at a lake

677
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,650
if you ensure she graphic without
reading it in

678
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,890
it's the state's no its to fact that

679
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:53,150
if you're into UNIX shell prompt you can
watch it if you're not interested you

680
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,630
not gonna watch it he is driven by money

681
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,720
people need jobs that's my point they
don't serve you with a serve advertisers

682
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,880
but to the point I I was trying to make
is that you should try to serve their

683
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,140
advertisers for them you shouldn't say
well

684
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,379
united to be interested in that I'm
gonna give them something else

685
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,120
you see this is what I am and if they're
gonna misrepresented little fight that

686
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,859
injustice when it comes around

687
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:18,770
but other was not my responsibility to
educate them in making unit shop front

688
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:22,330
look sexy in China mainland says you get
the movie hackers

689
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:28,299
I quit to get yeah okay actually

690
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,490
Michael disagree with this last
statement home

691
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:36,240
but more importantly make a bigger
comment that if we've created our own

692
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,100
media than

693
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:41,460
he would be just catering to us with the
only ingredient the way to do it is to

694
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,360
is to try to get

695
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,850
print with in the the mass media's and
that I I don't think that MTV is right

696
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:47,360
for me

697
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,210
think that wetherbee trade journals like
peace we can others that a lot times are

698
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,280
clueless but can he make you fall

699
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,240
and we do that is not by taking
interviews all the time whether that's

700
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,080
important part

701
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,910
but generate your own content a lot of
these magazines are looking for people

702
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,420
who are knowledgeable on the ya

703
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,260
in the arena if you generate the content
write an article in Summit

704
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,880
more often than not that point print it
because they want to be able to capture

705
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,840
audiences that they don't think they
have a you can place a start though

706
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,740
isn't it a chance for people to care

707
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,530
about units plants and bash he start
there any generate some interest there

708
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:22,740
are things that are in PC week in
information we cannot see the business

709
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,610
people read

710
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:27,060
eventually do get out to the new york
times in newsweek's the way to do it

711
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,759
isn't to say well wait for something if
you were to come to me and then I'll try

712
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,980
to give a good story

713
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:34,060
right to store your soft and submit it
to the journal's you think it's

714
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,310
appropriate for

715
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:39,029
generate the content more can consult
their more likely have a chance

716
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:42,700
up someone else picking it up and then
bring it out to the masses

717
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,060
i think thats I think that's excellent
that's definitely definitely a thing

718
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,380
thing to do I

719
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,790
if you if you can likes try to try to
build a relationship with reporters

720
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:54,640
they're very repro

721
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,740
approachable mom and get to know

722
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:01,110
editors if you can you know email now
you can actually do that like with your

723
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,220
local paper

724
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:07,970
get to be resource for that and it
possible right write a column

725
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:14,970
into that kinda thing that's that's
awaiting to counteract this

726
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,540
is there any value in having a crappy
show like that which has this

727
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:24,300
have planned a look what I can do with a
computer I get interested

728
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,850
and generating interest in that's like
in wrong channel

729
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:32,170
store display once you're there you meet
people and you can get into the whole

730
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:36,550
idea of what hits like maybe a few
really experienced or something you

731
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,600
think you can

732
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,710
yes Superman or something

733
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:44,240
at knee or something in you like get
into it right

734
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,840
you know and maybe like good things come
to you know you get a bunch of bad

735
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,880
patches to the Colonels comes out which
is more people

736
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,470
you know and maybe that's you are you
talking about how she like back control

737
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,080
people

738
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,290
into it and then as their in the
environment they can learn what it's

739
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,029
really about

740
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:05,120
detoxified overtime get works but you're
gonna wind up with

741
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,900
for everyone valuable individual like
three thousand two are just doing it

742
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,070
sure that the picket the week mean 10
things I was telling Serena

743
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:16,860
y0 hi I am eyes and a hacker do notice
the fact that I'm not on rollerblades

744
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:20,370
I'm not wearing teflon I L my hair is

745
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:24,350
generally welcome sorry hair again I
have

746
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:27,670
I i tend to think I like to speak
fluently

747
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:31,000
I be its

748
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,120
yes that image can attract individuals
to the community

749
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,390
but I I would tend to think that day

750
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:44,120
it's more price is too high yet to bring
people in that one

751
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:48,330
reason why I'm dying my hair some almost
thirty some China hold on to the year

752
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:52,220
okay it's not a hack here

753
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:57,340
thank you I also out the reason why sin
and I wasn't like she knew me as a

754
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:01,450
hacker's cos I did work for MTV and I
did the networking maricella

755
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,660
that's the only reason you know I didn't
get interviewed for the shower I was in

756
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,940
on the show anything at that

757
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,460
I was like a technical adviser for a
little bit 10 got cut

758
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,950
and by the way they did lay me off
shortly after the MTG show was on the

759
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,280
air

760
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,810
after three years he got it severance
package that and

761
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:23,150
ok stay is a case at least

762
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:28,320
yes arm I just like to mention that when
I saw MTV special public like the last

763
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:28,940
song

764
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:33,850
homes like an hour handout whenever I
could like less definite

765
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:37,270
when I serve in a police source harmless
and I'll

766
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,410
you know commitment TV is like a lot
leak it dearly

767
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:44,850
said most not much of a message to me
just simply could perspective like

768
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:48,970
ok like you know no manches movies like
peak actors or whatever

769
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:52,240
and unlike you know they seems like
actors that movie

770
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,280
that went like really that's more a trip
seen anything

771
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,960
to me because like illegal legalese
people weird color hair and everything

772
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,890
you know you might not notice to you
anything I gotta chill

773
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:07,129
we just have to keep doing it you know

774
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:11,030
you 50/50 know if this style about
themselves and everything

775
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,200
village which is like you know let's set
a be a hacker and stuff

776
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,180
in in like cum I also think like the
reason people have categorize us because

777
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:22,290
on people don't listen to like

778
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:26,590
Lee don't miss any more like a lot of
Lake people are outside or interest

779
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:30,450
like you know I try to explain my cousin
about how to do this now computer

780
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:34,600
she looks to me like %ah in like you
know the cheater slicks sorcerers almost

781
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,300
no

782
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:39,150
will really come like the wizard for
like two lone Bibles and books

783
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:42,500
might like that any significantly
advanced technology will be

784
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,590
indistinguishable from magic israeli

785
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:50,850
but it sets that's what it is is just
actually to buy homes to elect wizard

786
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:51,630
Gandalf from

787
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:55,020
ok enough public %eh I

788
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,270
relentless his you

789
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:03,380
this is sick fruity girly like special
or something and robust than later ride

790
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,870
the short bus

791
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:10,310
the the Sika if I could be categorized
that way

792
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:15,650
AP much 8 8ad better solution than
actually being categorized as a hatter

793
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:16,770
first but people think

794
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:21,690
us right now yep II don't introduce
myself to people at work Lehigh am

795
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:25,610
Tommy tackles on the hacker because you
know what the first thing they do

796
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:29,210
is the thing come out for any more
reason I'm out there for evil purposes

797
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:31,380
the other reaction I sometimes get

798
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,200
because I do try to sell myself I'm
consultant and

799
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,350
I get called in as Isaac the actor up

800
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:41,509
da come up in say allow can you do this

801
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:44,600
like you crash in airplane your still my
credit card info

802
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,000
or you don't have a problem with this
divorce case do you think you could find

803
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,360
this info on someone else

804
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,990
you just look at the guy jaw drops are
you serious

805
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:57,440
and it's a very sad kinda state of
affairs

806
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,900
that this is the stereotype we have to
live with up but

807
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:06,250
my basic advises ignore it is do your
own thing

808
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:11,790
it's going to be there because that's
what media is going to continue to

809
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:16,820
to dish out ok world my own question
though is like on how would you define

810
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,700
and hacker

811
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,020
um Lee certifications

812
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:25,460
sir he I disagree

813
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,880
I dislike certifications all ills

814
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,020
it's one of the take your questions what
is a hacker

815
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:38,060
and its you can get a lot responses
depending on who you are life seems many

816
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:42,190
definitions lie I think icon to the fact
that maybe like all this year

817
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:46,440
can be hackers in inches saw the ideal
phone

818
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,640
going on computer going you tune it
going Internet Relay Chat or whatever

819
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,490
like that

820
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:55,260
you like you know downloading
copyrighted material and

821
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,400
analytic it six so much there

822
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,680
yeah to choose from me nick de considers
outlaws because

823
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,029
healing all the clubs do a legal stuff I
like downloading mp3 sacher becomes a

824
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,100
convenient

825
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,960
box to put a lot of people if it
involves computers and some kind of

826
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,910
nefarious activity people like to throw
them in the tackle box

827
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,009
II for definitions from hacker that get
as strict

828
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:21,520
as you must have a soldering iron and
play with

829
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,410
out that the hardware certain key
systems you must know units inside and

830
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:25,899
out

831
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,270
and i've seen. ago is broad as anyone
who has

832
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:33,450
any interest in pushing the envelope
technology to be considered an actor

833
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:36,870
for instance the guy with his 57 shireen
in the garage you can

834
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:40,270
pool party the engine you know throw
back together and then go and have

835
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:40,840
dinner

836
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,560
all in one day I don't like that more
broad definition

837
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,770
so I think destroyed definitions will be
better because no so some

838
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:51,000
some people categorize it as computer
hackers

839
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,220
so they can be automobile hackers
whatever the case may be all the more

840
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,200
convenient 10 radio

841
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,140
technologies I got telephones so great

842
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:05,069
I personally think did in word hacker
has been overused

843
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:08,400
so therefore actors panel /url gonna get
together and make a whole bunch new

844
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,220
chance and copyright Thomson ok using
ever again yes I like this

845
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,630
it'll work dollar mean what would
there's a bunch people still trying to

846
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:16,710
push cracker

847
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:20,200
which as amateur Cryptologic cryptology
is time

848
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,950
still somewhat against we have for a
long time and we

849
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:27,980
regardless up you can't push terms on
the media they going to do whatever they

850
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,860
wanted

851
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,110
remember you as a viewer our commodity

852
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:37,870
when you watch television show the this
station is not trying to deliver to you

853
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:40,920
was trying to deliver your eyes to the
advertiser

854
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,960
you get your you're the product so far
as the media's

855
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:48,440
is concerned so they're not going to
investigate this stuff too deeply

856
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,080
because they're very few people who are
going

857
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:55,299
column on of course as you try to make
your show more and more sexy in whatever

858
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,830
else New Year year

859
00:50:56,830 --> 00:51:00,279
picking up on the whole hacker
subculture wifi teflon and

860
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,830
you know rollerblades and skates weird
things like that the hacker says it all

861
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:05,330
about

862
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:09,350
image there price it's 100 percent
images stereotypical image

863
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:12,490
now one of the challenges I like to give
to media people

864
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:16,760
is you know you can do eight reality
check back again just as many

865
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,180
viewers as peddling in net seems sorta
image that everyone else is doing

866
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,890
if you separate yourself from the pack
so far

867
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:28,720
folks just a tune in to get a reality
check on the rest stuff they've been

868
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,630
ditched

869
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:34,000
now imagine USA Today hackers received
non-threatening no

870
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,700
friendly hackers seems XYZ UK

871
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,160
you can wind up getting as many people
falling off the stands as for actor

872
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,450
downs TWA whatever it

873
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:48,230
their hacker interrupts nasa
communications which didn't happen

874
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:51,460
behavior but

875
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,390
yet I was applying economic

876
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:58,650
okay well just think I think we're

877
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:05,650
read it I'm so thanks for coming by

878
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:18,960
hip
