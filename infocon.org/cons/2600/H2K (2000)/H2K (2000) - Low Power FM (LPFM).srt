25
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:08,800
of an hour a I and a given talks to go
as much as two hours

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,420
just about the low-power fam at this
point because become such a complicated

27
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,640
and I torture us Rd love a subject

28
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,860
arm but its I for an hour

29
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,980
we're just gonna start talk a little bit
about this trip ira radio and and how

30
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,869
that end up with us are having

31
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,330
others sort of up our fam ruling that is

32
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,349
going into a fact over the course the
next couple months old are

33
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:36,790
and is gonna Star low bat with our with
talking a little bit about

34
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,640
are earlier umpiring dads

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,790
its kinda strange with the OL LPFM stuff
I don't really see it is replacing

36
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,129
higher radio in my replace some other
community stations

37
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:53,388
in some locations but I don't really see
my radio is disappearing

38
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:56,459
really I see it as being something
that's kind of a

39
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,819
are complementary to fire a Deo an up I
radio goes back

40
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:03,950
really right to the very beginning of
radio

41
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,239
by KTK incisions like that whenever they
were first on

42
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,480
they were just run by ham radio
operators without any licenses

43
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,609
and now they did just broadcast the
wherever they felt like it

44
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:18,859
and now than in the twenties they got
into the I'll

45
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:22,969
the licensing other stations and for all
that time

46
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:28,049
there then I mean the stations like this
being called Pirates goes back to the

47
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:29,019
1920s

48
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:32,769
soap I radios been around you know
really as

49
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:36,019
as an entity for seventy-five years

50
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:39,930
are but the FM band doesn't start until

51
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,629
the 1940s and nobody really messed
around that much with the FM band

52
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:50,129
are experimentally like a.m. Empire
situations until

53
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,540
or the 1970 well sixties for the most
part

54
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,578
an hour %uh the first

55
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:59,980
well a lot of people have said that the

56
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,749
the FM hearts have started in like the
late 80's early 90's and that's not true

57
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:06,299
the

58
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,099
the first up from pirates are major
Pirates go back to the late sixties

59
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,680
and there were some hippie stations and
now one of the best-known stations was

60
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,100
station just up in Yonkers called
falling star network

61
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,350
and they had a a couple of the AM
stations were heard all over the

62
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,710
northeast and they're also on FM

63
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,450
and during those days they got a huge
like four hundred-pound

64
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,430
a military transmitter and they were
broadcasting a

65
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,680
that way in a had an open door policy in
the basement of their house

66
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,910
and they just add anybody coming in a
broadcasting

67
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,169
whether no matter what

68
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:50,109
condition they were in our or whatever
upscale

69
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,320
mmm bubbles go level skill

70
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,070
or condition arm yet temporary
impairments

71
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,930
arm so they broadcast it for a couple
years

72
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,980
and they were closed down by the FCC and
in that time they actually want to the

73
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,060
FCC field offices in applied

74
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,790
several times for licenses and they were
actually laughed at by the FCC and

75
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,140
and told the you know you can have a a
radio station

76
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,430
they're just they're just teenagers and
they didn't deserve to be on the radio

77
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,910
arm and not through that time there Ben

78
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,200
you know since then there haven't been
too many a major operations but there

79
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,210
have been a few

80
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,229
like in a in the early eighties there's
a station called radio free ithaca

81
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:38,580
that was on for pose another community
conversation I think they were running

82
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,090
a twenty-four hours a day the same way
Anna so a lot of the FM stations have

83
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,250
been people who have a

84
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,790
arm either been experimenting with

85
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,940
with broadcasting just

86
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,430
simply as an experiment war there have
been a handful of the

87
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,420
24/7 kind of collective stations but
really in the

88
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,310
in the late eighties that's when the
beginning of that happen with the

89
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,270
arm black liberation radio and now that
was one once it started

90
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,359
from the popularity of the 24 /7

91
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,700
arm concept for broadcasting and
collective

92
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,330
broadcasting just having all kinds of
people come into a station

93
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,669
and broadcast

94
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,200
and you can talk more about that

95
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,780
yes so I'll I guess about 1996 at night
mostly just

96
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,300
talk my own experience are myself and
five other people

97
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,340
are started are the radium unical active
the reason we did it was

98
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,860
are first of all a we were our

99
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,040
are fairly horrified by the developments
in media

100
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,360
are over the over the course of the I'll
the

101
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,750
though years just prior to that the
Telecommunications Act 1996

102
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,610
had had been passed and was going to
allow for unprecedented consolidation

103
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,770
ownership in media I we're starting to
see statistics like

104
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,780
%ah and there's actually a fairly old
one

105
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,800
the 10 corporations on fifty percent a
ball

106
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,480
media thats that such as radio
television ads newspapers stops

107
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,580
are movies that music production

108
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,150
and up it and it's projected that

109
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,150
within 10 years it could be that three
or four corporations could on 75 percent

110
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,330
a bomb media so we were very along by
that trend

111
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,710
we're also very alarmed by I a number of
instances

112
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,000
up censorship on National Public Radio
are

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,270
and %ah and the cancellation a different
programs in the Philadelphia area

114
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,469
and are we have become we have been made
aware I love

115
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,310
are a black liberation radio and free
radio berkeley

116
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,230
and the the success is a Pirates at that
time and so we decided that we would

117
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,480
give it a try

118
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,990
and I'll you know it star with by must
not a bus with any radio experience

119
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,480
whatsoever

120
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,560
hard namaste with an ER particular
technical knowledge and it it definitely

121
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,450
showed

122
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,820
I over the course of the done first
punch a month

123
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,900
at about seven or eight months to get on
the air and I'll figure out

124
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,230
the difference between coaxial cable
handjob an

125
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,400
and audio patters and and we

126
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,640
ended up our movie ended up somehow
managing to get on the hour

127
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,010
and within a few are months I love

128
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:31,880
a bar first broadcast we were out %uh
station that was on the air seven nights

129
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,189
per week where

130
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,079
over 50 or sixty DJ's and i were really

131
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:40,860
arm it became obvious that we had tapped
into something that was

132
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,219
doubt that was really are something
people wanted to do

133
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,290
and I'll we were barely I'll

134
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,569
we were really impressed by what happens
when suddenly

135
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,630
a neighborhood that doesn't have an
outlet that doesn't have any control

136
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,950
over time media

137
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,290
is suddenly able to start arm you know
all the talent that starts coming out

138
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,529
the woodwork

139
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:05,660
in just about every neighborhood that
you could think of has

140
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,589
someone with a collection up the musical
lower serbia

141
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:13,079
arm hand you know about wasn't the
records and and I'll play them all night

142
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,550
long and they have

143
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,650
just about every neighborhood as someone
that can hard

144
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,840
you know read the Apopka Gilgamesh and
you now I am

145
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,529
now in ten-part serialization and and
that is just the sort of thing that you

146
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:26,320
cannot

147
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,900
I'll find anywhere on the radio dial
because it's not that that makes money

148
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,390
but it

149
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,380
its its thus our programming that really
comes from our people's hearts

150
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,720
and and that people put real paper and
its

151
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,790
it what cam can create and maintain

152
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,209
our local cultures I as as against the

153
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,900
sort of the the Walmart I the Walmart
approach the culture that we have in

154
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,290
america today

155
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,969
so we were very excited arm of course

156
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,380
I'll when you're when you're defying
federal regulations

157
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,990
are there's only so long that it can go
I and you can just or to get away with

158
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,570
that

159
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,700
eventually radio mutiny was I'll was our

160
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,860
first warned by the by the FCC

161
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,760
and then we got about five or six visits
where they just kept on Tara could join

162
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,050
us to try to go of the hour

163
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,830
each time we decided that we would are
we would

164
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,250
meet them back with AR on

165
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,580
with some haven't oppressed on so the
very first time they came in a

166
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,290
they tried to I guess the shutdown well
we did shut down for about three days

167
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,779
and then we turned our station back on
the air

168
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:37,529
are in pana benjamin franklin's printing
process in downtown Philadelphia

169
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:41,779
has been battered sad 1763 Ben Franklin

170
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:45,640
defies the British I by publishing poor
Richards meh

171
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,220
almanac are 1996 radio mute me defies
the FCC

172
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,190
hands I you know in that in the cause of
freedom of speech

173
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,290
and so every time we we met them with
another pressed on

174
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,370
and we we started I

175
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,770
bringing I'll you know bring the issue

176
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,240
further and further into the public
consciousness trying as hard as we could

177
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,370
to embarrass

178
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,380
the FCC into changing its policies

179
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,380
I into are coming up with

180
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,490
a new set of rules that would allow for
for community radio stations

181
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,529
because the the truth in the matter is
there they're really years

182
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:24,720
are no law physics that says that

183
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,740
the media have to be on by corporations
that's really just

184
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,339
that the social arrangement its at the
choice that's been made by

185
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,760
by our government and are but

186
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,180
we we realize that I'll we we felt that
we had %uh political savvy to

187
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,220
arm along with the movement up are
thousands of other pirates across the

188
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,010
country

189
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,680
to maneuver them into the position where
they would have to change the rules

190
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,750
and are impact that's are

191
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,920
more or less what happened I after

192
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,740
a number of years a deliberation are the
SEC did

193
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,080
I'll pass a new set of rules that would
allow

194
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,330
for neighborhood radio stations like by
I

195
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,589
like pretty much like what brady a
mutiny was

196
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:12,839
home and our

197
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,080
it was it was a limited

198
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,089
victory for us arm but it was

199
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:22,830
nonetheless something that we when when
we saw the final rules

200
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,529
I we decide that we really felt like it
was it was worth pursuing

201
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:31,680
I to create a you now been sort of
obvious or

202
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,339
licensed $10,200 while a

203
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:39,290
neighborhood radio stations and we
realize that there are going to be

204
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:43,219
arm a they're gonna be many many

205
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,630
hundreds and perhaps thousands of
opportunities across the country

206
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,839
for for neighborhoods like our like
around to to start rotations

207
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,440
home one

208
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,450
from them just dawn okay

209
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,480
cell are likened to a little bit about

210
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,020
years is the nature of the compromise
that ended up

211
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,800
ended up coming about I'll what we asked
for

212
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,490
was we said that I'll

213
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,920
are we propose this out I love
regulations

214
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,640
that I'll would allow who are are not
all that many stations but at least to a

215
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,850
reasonable number for

216
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,420
for every are for every city in the
United States

217
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,110
what the SEC came back with under
extreme pressure from the incumbent

218
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,250
broadcasters

219
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,960
was repose all are was in back to set a
brawls

220
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,020
that would allow probably between one

221
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:44,110
and five our new stations in most
metropolitan areas

222
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,970
after our the top five arm

223
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,520
so are the just the nature I love

224
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,829
up the way the FM dial has been
allocated up until now

225
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:59,529
are means that basically New York
Chicago and Los Angeles

226
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:05,010
are the way that the SEC structured its
rules did not leave any room for

227
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,220
any news stations at all and his roles
which was

228
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,860
are a very severe disappointment to ask
especially because we knew

229
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,190
that are from a technical standpoint it
was perfectly

230
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,580
are reasonable to to put more stations
on the dial in those places

231
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,800
are however just about every place else
has

232
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,820
I at least are at least

233
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,140
you know between one and five stations
and sell are

234
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,130
at least are set for me the Israel
Project decide that it was worth

235
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:38,270
I'll has worked on had around the
country and

236
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,990
and and trying to licenses may stations
as we could and try to expand the rules

237
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,420
are further as time went on and as the

238
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,720
are the the record became just

239
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,930
crystal clear on on the level of
interference that

240
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,540
that putting more stations on the dial
word would have

241
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,709
are I mean opposition in all this is the
National Association of Broadcasters

242
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:05,790
the the broadcasters have I'll

243
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,209
they basically that they did I forget
how much it was i think at least a half

244
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,060
a million dollars worth of

245
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,640
studies to prove that this was
impossible

246
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,790
I that was a very difficult thing
because that the truth of the matter is

247
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,630
that the info

248
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,360
the interference that could be created
by these

249
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,839
is small stations is so small that

250
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,640
it's almost it's almost meaningless if
it would add

251
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,730
fractions up up fractions of a percent

252
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,820
to to overall interference environment
to the fam

253
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,480
are however they you know they had a lot
of money and so they put as much as they

254
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,290
could enter

255
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,209
into studies that would prove that that
I'll

256
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:49,970
the hope our fam Woodward word would
interfere drastically with existing

257
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,520
radio environment

258
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,100
what the what they actually had to do an
art to to claim now

259
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,680
was are they tested about 28 radios and

260
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,790
are they basically that the performance
standards that they suck for those tasks

261
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,349
found that over I'll I think it was

262
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,589
sixteen or seventeen of those radios had

263
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:14,420
unacceptable audio quality without any
interference from

264
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,570
from a low-power FM station at all and

265
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,399
so that they had that the audio
standards so high that

266
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,790
that that that the tests were basically
meaningless

267
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,050
so a so I in any case

268
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:32,700
the you know because they lost on the
technical merits of their arguments

269
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,450
they decided that they would go are
instead up to that

270
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:41,209
CC's engineers who are course are the
people that don't know more about us

271
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,990
then a be decided that they would go are
two people that knew less about that

272
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,970
and namely that congressman and are

273
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,870
so but now we have a spectacle love up

274
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,910
a number of Congressman Mike take me is
you now half a million dollars worth of

275
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,899
studies in mice on them down on the
table once I am

276
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:03,000
you know the FCC has are

277
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,240
you know have has done a bad job
regulating

278
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,679
comes back from as it stands the

279
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,909
House of Representatives the understands
the FCC is passed up our fam

280
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,980
and up our fam is going into a fact
they've already accepted

281
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,939
I'll the first round of occasions
probably be

282
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,539
issuing licenses over the course are the
next

283
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:28,269
two or three months are as it stands

284
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:32,010
it's completely there's really nothing
stopping at

285
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,289
the only thing that really can stop it
at this point years

286
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:39,769
that the House of Representatives passed
the bill preventing now to see from

287
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:43,159
from going forward with my power am in a
meaningful way

288
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:46,460
day call for our up billions of dollars
so

289
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:52,179
more testing and are and actually no
money allocated doctor do the testing

290
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:55,940
so day are they basically have tried
their best to

291
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,990
to stop it dead in the water arm

292
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,360
the House of Representatives passed the
bill the senate is

293
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,960
are currently considering it are that
sort of

294
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,120
it sort of our plan going in the thana
arm

295
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,170
and the current president has

296
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,590
stated that his are supportive about our
fam

297
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,240
and would would not be very inclined to
sign a bill that would

298
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,370
word pasa so our worst

299
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,640
actual danger is that'll be snuck in as
an appropriations ride our

300
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,790
on some kind of a bill that are doubt
president would be afraid not to

301
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,240
not to sign so a

302
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,010
at least as far as we're concerned I
low-power times basically going had

303
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:43,010
and to applications

304
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:48,040
are are divided into of 5 Sep 10 states
the first

305
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,670
Sat already when and that included
states like car

306
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:57,370
California alaska Utah louisiana

307
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,610
Maryland Maine Washington DC

308
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,690
so there was a five-day window which was
when

309
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,000
you're able to me apply for these
licenses

310
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,040
on and some others will probably be
coming soon in the next window

311
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,010
there's our Minneapolis are

312
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:18,179
her house Kansas

313
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,960
new hampshire are home in two states

314
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,820
New York is in the third window which
applications are due in November

315
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,260
and basically in order to apply it's a
seven-page form

316
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,390
a you don't have to be are you don't
have to be all that smart to fill it out

317
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,910
on it's %ah it's got a lot of things are

318
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,950
a you know they'll basically ask you you
know that

319
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,990
you can't apply as an individual are you
have to be part of some kind of an

320
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,890
organization

321
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,020
it doesn't necessarily have to be a
nonprofit but it has to be

322
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,030
an organization of some sort are that
years are

323
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,428
you know has a governing structure
Houseal Michael board of directors are

324
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:03,860
or something like that it up in Bastar
you now

325
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,070
go to your local while rotary clobber

326
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:11,590
library are you now Greenpeace chapter
or something like that hand

327
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:15,699
ask them to apply for you know apply for
a licence

328
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,370
arm then a

329
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:23,020
you know it'll ask you a buncha
questions are about

330
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,530
other the exact location that you want
to broadcast from so it can determine

331
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,960
are weather station can be cited from
now

332
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,770
are there will be our questions about

333
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,980
I'll whether you own any other media and
trusts

334
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,790
if you if you actually our own a daily
newspaper you're not allowed to have a

335
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,559
low power FM station

336
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,580
are and I it asks you

337
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,639
well you know our your grandmother's
maiden name a you know whole buncha

338
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,799
I sorta about

339
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:58,840
sort a simple technical questions
there's no need for an engineering study

340
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,370
are because the FTC basically does the
engineering study for you

341
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:06,620
and there's also no need for I

342
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,760
there's no need for a 501 c3 and

343
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,660
there's no application fee its it's a
free application

344
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,710
so it's really are it's a pretty
straightforward process

345
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,280
for me the Israel Project has has are
published a guide

346
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,110
which pay

347
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,120
which we have here which is free which I

348
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,049
hi gives you basically a rundown of how
to fill out the forms and how to

349
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:35,220
how to how to get it all together and
then once

350
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:41,820
are want someone to fill out the forms
are just sorta wait for a few months and

351
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,760
and and see what they do about the the
biggest rack is

352
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,220
is availability of frequencies and our

353
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,240
what you really have to do is you up to
sorta be willing to

354
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,230
I think pretty flexibly about where you
gonna put

355
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,429
because are

356
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:04,059
it even a difference of a few hundred
yards can make the difference between

357
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,129
whether you can cite

358
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,970
a radio station there or not and in an
urban area

359
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,140
and our radio licenses on my driver's
licenses he can't drive around with them

360
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,250
or anything like that

361
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,520
you know broadcast station has to be at
a fixed point so

362
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,730
you need to have a a

363
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,309
a real are are a location that suitable

364
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:29,610
and basically all you have to do is you
find dole out in longitude at the place

365
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,460
where you want to broadcast from

366
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,669
what you can get of the Internet and
just are

367
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:38,179
you know drop it and and a top place
doesn't work you know

368
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:41,419
ask your friend you know have tried and
tried different buildings around town

369
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:43,929
till you find one that has clear
frequency

370
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:48,410
and our then are

371
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,720
then want your application is accepted

372
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,880
there's are there's a phase

373
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,919
out which day work out competing
applications

374
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,549
because the vast majority obligations
the vast majority of frequencies

375
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:06,200
there's more than one organization a
monster user

376
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,640
so are what you basically have to do

377
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,169
is sorta cut some kind of a deal between
all the different people that wanna user

378
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:18,480
arm and if you can't cut a deal that's
the CEO cut a deal for you at all

379
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,770
you know sort of split up the time one
way or another to

380
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,840
to make sure that as many are

381
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,070
different folks that wanna do this are
common it is possible

382
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,178
so are it's actually

383
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:34,390
it's a slightly repugnant situation if
you end up

384
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,330
I having the you know anarchist radio
station

385
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,570
I'll sharing the frequency with the
right to life station or something like

386
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,490
that

387
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:48,179
arm but I actually think that that that
that such exercises are sorta

388
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:51,299
arm I

389
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:54,460
frustrating but but but good for
everyone saw something

390
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,490
sensibilities a a free speech so

391
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,970
arm and then I'll and then you build the
thing

392
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,010
I'll when we were pirates

393
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:09,040
I mean we build art initial station for
about seven or eight hundred dollars

394
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,730
and that's that's how much it cost for
the actual equipment

395
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,900
arm but when you're dealing with with my
since the are good lighting stations

396
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,640
yet costs are quite a bit more but it's
not

397
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,280
necessarily outreach love like I'll you
now

398
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,020
a well-organized group that that's going
to put on a couple big sales

399
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,090
arm I I'm pretty sure that are

400
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,280
we could figure out a way to put one on
the air for about five thousand bucks or

401
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,080
so

402
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,789
arm under under the new licensing and of
course it somewhat higher power

403
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:44,640
for for are for a hundred what station
are our station was

404
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,470
was broadcasting at forty what some

405
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,620
sold

406
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,090
that's thats or to the basics a about
the power of a mess

407
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,799
arm one thing i'd reeling

408
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:01,408
really encourage people to think about
years are you know people out

409
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:04,470
sort all different ways of approaching
doing a radio station

410
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,559
and our im my own experience

411
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:11,220
the know the best part about other
community radio station

412
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,260
is is really the diversity other and in

413
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,100
impact it was one of the things that
that let us to

414
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,059
decide that we won we we want satisfied
just be pirates

415
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:25,580
anymore because arm you know

416
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,610
it was not that hard for us to find you
know fifty or sixty people that bro

417
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:34,440
going to be somewhat pool party and risk
a ten thousand dollar fine or a raster

418
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:34,799
are

419
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,010
or whatever but what are

420
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,860
what was difficult was we kept on doing
outreach to more and more of our

421
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,590
neighbors

422
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,370
and a lot of our neighbors got really
excited about joining our station but

423
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,169
for one reason or another they just
couldn't take the rest

424
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:54,010
are you there are you now whatever they
had arm prior records and made in

425
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,370
montana with the law

426
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,630
they were i'ma grants day

427
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,789
you now have families are this about an

428
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:05,309
one other things that we really fell was
that as

429
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:10,250
bureaucratic and are as limited as the
new licensing would be

430
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,350
are we felt the radio

431
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,350
community radio shouldn't just be for
the four hearty

432
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:19,990
and the rack class it should really be
for for pretty much everyone

433
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:23,840
and that was our that was what motivated
us to

434
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,049
to channel lot of our energy into are

435
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:32,100
you know into into making a low-power
fam are come about so

436
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,720
call fun anything else are you are
certain questions

437
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:42,720
short for those people were still for
Hardy in reckless here's some %ah

438
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,620
arm transmitting set-ups these are both
just

439
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,649
low-power low-power fire stations

440
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:55,850
on this one is was running half what
policía this is 11

441
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,309
and depending on conditions yes a stereo

442
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:05,750
arm ramzi transmitter was an FM 100 and
I can get out

443
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,779
the pair it all depends on antenna
height for

444
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:12,630
how far station gets out and decision
like this

445
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:17,260
with a decent time I get up get out of
it a couple miles fairly well

446
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,629
Anna this for whenever the LPF am

447
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:25,820
goes through those stations won't be
able to use transmitters like these

448
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,250
other have to be typed except the
transmitters which means that they have

449
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,389
to be acceptable

450
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:33,620
acceptable by the FCC Anna arm

451
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,990
and they go through and check em out
then there's a a fee for doing that so

452
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,299
that jacked up the prices

453
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:42,320
transmitters all right now I think the
lowest I P

454
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,870
accepted FM transmitters our summer
around a thousand two thousand dollars

455
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,980
and other expected to drop a little bit
whenever some most the

456
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,200
the hobby like pirate radio our company
start getting into

457
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,000
Tom building FM type except the
transmitters like

458
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,110
Ramsey and broadcast warehouse and
Veronica couple those companies are

459
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,340
working on right now

460
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,610
arm so this one isn't type accepted so
you can

461
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:11,880
neither these you could use in 10 the
LPFM stations but they will get out

462
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,799
a couple miles arm see also

463
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:19,649
compressor

464
00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:24,909
love it has longer into your limited
limiting

465
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:29,279
in the in the compressor and others are
pretty

466
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,850
important for making everything sound
wilder

467
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,799
and adding more punch to it if you hear
dis a transmitter alone

468
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,230
it won't sound nearly as wild you tune
it in an hour to sound

469
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,309
real thin and weak compared to other
stations with the

470
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:48,668
the compressor limiter on it it all jack
up the levels

471
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:51,710
given a lot more punch all

472
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,899
yeah its it's on the air its actually
getting out in here

473
00:28:55,899 --> 00:29:00,590
probably about to fifty feet or so

474
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:04,230
the

475
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,409
hours broadcasting the soundtrack from
the movie that was on my side

476
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:14,409
anybody with an FM radio within 50 feet
of here can hear

477
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:24,300
next to the compressor is the well also
with that has limited limiting which

478
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,320
means that the

479
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,530
a limiter what it does is keeps keeps a
on the peaks from

480
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:34,730
distorting so those are really helpful
to our next to it is a CD player

481
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:38,890
and you know those are the

482
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:44,110
polity there's a an inverter but
inverters really are two handy with this

483
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,750
kinda equipment because they put on

484
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:52,750
a buzz usually on the audio

485
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:59,960
oh okay said it actually does work
pretty well in a %uh vehicle this

486
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,450
the this suitcase type radio station the
plug in the cigarette lighter

487
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,030
and with the mobile antenna that now
paramount range I

488
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,770
at it we're gonna be giving away

489
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,970
wannabes today and this

490
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,000
escaped from Ramsey electronics sells
for about three hundred dollars

491
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,860
and they sell at a lower price case in
the 100 some dollar range and already

492
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,240
down like 20 some dollars

493
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,730
and %uh the owner Ramsey electronics
conference john ramsey talk on the phone

494
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,050
yesterday he's gonna Dhoni

495
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:33,919
wannabes to either FM 25 kids which is
also synthesized

496
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,760
free pretty good quality inexpensive kit
an FM 10 which is our not so great but

497
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,420
it's an expensive the way to get started

498
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,120
so when this is over on stay here
drawing

499
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,160
for these four transmitter kit if you're
interested in having won

500
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,010
so

501

Seattle arm

504
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,200
it was our right now it's our at

505

was ours are playing and back together
but up

507
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,770
it was bill I with a a

508
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,920
with an antenna that came out of a

509
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:24,130
was

510
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,890
there was a our cosby's coaxial

511
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:33,110
cosby's coaxial cable they came up your
sleeve and across your arm

512
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:38,150
and into the handle up an umbrella and
went up the umbrella

513
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:42,910
I and there was an extending telescoping
wept the came out I am

514
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,630
dumbbell a have formed a little ground
plane antenna

515
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,890
hom more last I cannot

516
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:53,770
really speak for the SWR love a berth
particular

517
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:57,290
ground plane antenna but it was our
there was

518
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:01,149
I'll her but but it was i

519
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:05,390
it was it was our I definitely out
mildly affected our

520
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,910
a group love a group of folks walked
around with them boxers in Seattle

521
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,570
during the demonstrations and

522
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,960
are this thing was dealt with a little
mix are

523
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,490
are in the side so that you could just
sort of bob

524
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:23,570
you know control the levels as you
walked and

525
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:27,149
and you know put the microphone any old
person's face and just say

526
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,440
well what you see going on there you
know arm

527
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,110
so job and I'll miss transmitters also

528
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:39,370
I been used for a buncha to in different
incarnations it was used for

529
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,960
arm well for instance I was used for
critical mass ride

530
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,940
month folks know what critical mass
earth critical mass is I'll

531
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,140
it's a bike ride where r I every

532
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,900
job last Friday of the month hundreds a
bicyclist got together and

533
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:59,290
and just ask our take over a particular
little patch up the streets

534
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:03,270
and are right around altogether are for
other safety in numbers

535
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:07,220
and it's sort of like a big party on
party on bikes

536
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,140
I'll at the end to the work week and
I'll

537
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,280
so we decide to bring out trans this
transmitter once

538
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,060
and our we had a are we are our friends

539
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:22,250
are passed out boom boxes to the back at
their bicycles

540
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,400
we had one of our DJ sitting in the back
above a bicycle car

541
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,920
and we just you know Sarah are right
around the streets and play about a good

542
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,830
music to

543
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:35,130
to bicycle by but the pokers I think we
had on a particular day

544
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,880
arm the transmitter was also used

545
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,980
are any union drive and I'll

546
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,130
and northern I Pennsylvania

547
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:49,000
I'll it was so are set up in a band and
there was a

548
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,420
there was a job site that the the
Industrial Workers of the World was

549
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,010
trying to organize

550
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:58,390
and they weren't allowed I entrance to
the property

551
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:03,300
so day are elected to you are I use this
transmitter to

552
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,840
broadcast and I you know their
propaganda and they are

553
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,250
you know sorry Union music in art right
thing there was our

554
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,810
used our how's about I a year and a half

555
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,060
ago so you know just %ah

556
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,310
communities ap examples to you know so
you can

557
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,330
so I think about are doctor radio

558
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:29,440
does not really have to be you know just
the concessions

559
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,918
concession stand for corporate America
make it doesn't have to just be a

560
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:34,589
plaything up the powerful

561
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,909
they can be it's a relatively simple
technology

562
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,620
that are you know even someone such as
myself who knew nothing about it

563
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,870
not three or four years ago can with an
hour you know

564
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,980
six months or so have managed to are

565
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,469
a you know operate I relatively
successfully

566
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:56,840
arm and I you know so does your
imaginations

567
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:02,570
that's what our you know that's what
that's already a should be

568
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:06,410
arm 10 and not a US are taking questions

569
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:10,549
