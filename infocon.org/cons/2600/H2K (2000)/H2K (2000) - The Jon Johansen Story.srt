give you what you want and the nearly
fused together

90
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,669
anything before that a court order and
the

91
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:50,900
let me said to me I have made the copies

delete

94
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:04,630
hick

95
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,960
the the case in no way is

96
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,979
the pending and they was supposed to
reach a decision and dole may

97
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:20,590
but nothing happened that put a lid on
the case

98
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:26,500
the we have heard that they have sent
the case to some

99
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,069
law professors to get to see what AM

100
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:35,750
make up the case but the for some folks
have told us a

101
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,710
there he can't do anything 11

102
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:46,710
I think I will close the case without
doing anything

103
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:59,680
and

104
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,310
have to tell you that or case is

105
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,610
not that important but the whole case of
free speech

106
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,870
and the free programs is very important

107
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,260
but because he's cuddly does to

108
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,300
the the a complete control from this

109
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,660
the major companies I could give example

110
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,880

111
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,130
make DVDs which will self destruct often

112
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:38,820
better than ten times but perhaps there

113
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,860
the next step will be in like in men in
black

114
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,870
if you buy a film look at the other end
a an issue memory

164
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,240
most the day newspapers wrote yeah
articles

165
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,410
which refer to descend scoping until
this and small and

166
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,150
Musa magazines the just basically be
wrote articles

167
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:36,230
met add much same content but the

168
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,690
recently they start referring to this SN

169
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,730
as a pay-back can device that's that

170
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,010
wrong as well not that good

171
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,270
test

172
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:57,270
on Monday said

173
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:04,970
s

174
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,460
well and the trial among them nothing
more than the

175
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,900
2006 on a trial I've been added
dissident

176
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,340
named defendant the California trade
secret try

177
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,820
lawsuit but a.m. unless I go to
California can't really do men think

178
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,880
the cat the cat they can to make me but
that

179
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,980
they won't get mixed extradited

180
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,100
at s

181
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,630
good

182
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,400
and their focus is a British

183
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,430
programmer who worked there he did the

184
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:52,350
first the and CSS actually divided into
two parts you got all three say she

185
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,530
and decryption fell through station call
was posted in assembly

186
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,970
announcement anonymously on the Internet
at the Rec focus is the person who

187
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,340
revolted in C

188
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,440
at on jury member to case

189
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,930
a sweet asian girl segal and

190
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,660
actually did rebuff the GPL Heather but
the

191
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,280
later sold out but don't focus but the

192
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,310
Dec focus got in legal trouble in the
Britain

193
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,240
to be at 2 give away all those rights to
call

194
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,240
on the maintenance s

195
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,230
yeah I I thought the German member about

196
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,410
3-4 days before I left earlier when US

197
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,709
and opted to each member im bout month

198
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,720
s

199
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,630
up

200
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,990
I've been shot been what a what lawyers
like to refer to as the hacker paragraph

201
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:02,120
K with you said basically says new break
into a computer system

202
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,779
and the second part charges scope right
infringement

203
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:12,779
our contribution to copyright
infringement

204
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:17,059
it is me whole app

205
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,129
although we're at the time 3

206
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:23,999
all your I will be sent in this November

207
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:27,019
and the diction and bright

208
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,199
known only sage I guess is somewhere in
20's

209
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:35,589
that in German members about 26 I think

210
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:39,980
s

211
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:46,180
could

212
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,760
want

213
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,290
yes at

214
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,100
yeah and uses at only call

215
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,510
that common problems so still wasn't yet

216
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,400
but the source code the both the source
gus

217
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,660
that most certainly some internet the
boss some

218
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,680
but it wasn't the same as the binary
Russian

219
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,590
was one of two one of two early russians

220
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,569
sweet should have worked but if he
didn't

221
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:26,569
I'm not surprised but the binary version
should work fine

222
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,429
yes the only unit

223
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:40,750
Hill yet

224
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,080
no all

225
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,530
make I'll Mike

226
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,740
could get convicted but won't mean much
on the single count

227
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,240
point

228
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,240
it's not just an election

229
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,930
but actually I didn't really key come
forward was wired

230
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,710
publish my name and song on the live man
miss

231
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:21,710
s

232
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:36,489
he will knows the German member he
reverse engineering

233
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:39,789
the acting any player he sent his the

234
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:43,700
results to me and I created the actual
DCS application

235
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,700
CD Universe changing

236
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:52,830
announcement s

237
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:59,830
think up

238
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,720
up

239
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,480
but you can't really stop piracy there
is no such thing as copy protection

240
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,510
some national way to stop it have to
just

241
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,490
make people buy legal copious by making
reasonable prices

242
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:29,490
good products skink

243
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,600
good yes that's all

244
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:43,600
and yes no more questions up

245
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,660
and no way knowing the maximum

246
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,440
and peace two years for the hacker para
of

247
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,460
and that three years for a cop and
change

248
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,720
infringement in California I'm not
really sure

249
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,410
civil town bills

250
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:13,410
I'm not facing civil Panthers in no way
script it's a criminal charge

251
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,010
s

252
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,640
back

253
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,190
well the region colonies action a
separate issue as the region code is

254
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,400
stored and

255
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,750
a file called me deal underscore PS dot

256
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,750
IFO on the DVD disc store at pics of the
23

257
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,030
and if you buy a region

258
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,420
to DVD in your opinion what pay and US

259
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,340
left:2d crypt the DVD then edited the
Utes

260
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,959
I file and then you can play it and
that's the only have a region actually

261
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,640
playing

262
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,640
tested

263
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:23,059
up

264
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:37,000
yes absolutely that was that's what
we're trying to do trying to redefine

265
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,019
piracy

266
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:45,019
and take welfare fair use rights good

267
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:55,090
yeah I think so s

268
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:05,230
yet yes section yet section ole law

269
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,370
so the they don't really have a law that
it they can

270
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,850
get me get me on slick trying to apply

271
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,890
that all long this case which

272
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:21,890
probably won't work get a creaking and
DVD disc as a computer system

273
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,090
like broken into my own DVD good

274
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,959
s

275
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,890
good

276
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:40,110
if Emanuel's lawyers months into

277
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:47,110
gongs witness I will s

278
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:51,880
index are we talking to access and that
400

279
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,289
the sucky circuits issued a

280
00:22:55,289 --> 00:23:02,289
slow

281
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,350
well-lit cutie three value talk about
bolting

282
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:13,909
or the pipes issue or you got the VZ SS

283
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:17,289
ellen is great

284
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:22,490
no a it might end up like mp3

285
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:29,490
but I don't really find a quality that
good

286
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:39,030
yes

287
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,100
actually actually sold out I got a job
now I

288
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,980
so I'll be I'll going to take a rest in
high school

289
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,000
as you going nowhere a pillowcase

290
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,210
study study enrollment a sense

291
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,030
and fun couple yes I'll probably be
studying in France

292
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:04,030
%um and work still up

293
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:14,220
s

294
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:25,780
a QP 3p2 resolution you mention up

295
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,160
no resolution what you eat and some but
its Palo NTC

296
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,750
good

297
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:41,050
both the PAL pala solution is sis

298
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:45,379
and 2720

299
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:52,380
times for 80 I can hear it a key step up
to my phone

300
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,950
thanks okay people here know yeah hurry

301
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,280
okay a other the resolution a

302
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,950
impact to video is 124

303
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,559
by 768 a standard that all the hollywood
movies are released

304
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,760
and the player converses to to by the
local TV standard

305
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,470
however if you are hack into the player
and a couple minor

306
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,900
with the proper attack video card you
can have poll

307
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,950
a resolution you can't DVD on

308
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:33,559
units in Stony you hell and he wishes

309
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:38,309
and he sent twenty times for 80 NTSC is

310
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:41,399
yes Balika and

311
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,900
at best but I my understanding is that
the

312
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,900
that's not true recipe that's what they
want you

313
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,210
yes really on the DVD is a is a focal
the picture

314
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:56,610
by pack player think

315
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:01,500
yes yes he was your HDTV set but I I was
in there

316
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,950
sentence mater you get full resolution
that is if you take it right of the

317
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,750
additional

318
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,080
asshole quite I'll

319
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,178
Ikea actually not good

320
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:16,770
hated by hey hey yes we do yourself yes
sorry out its not sell

321
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,600
yeah at another thing I want to comment
on is that in Australia

322
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,850
it's illegal to sell a DVD machine that
has not been hacked

323
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:29,100
actually open new Dr recess that

324
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,679
perhaps that is illegal to sell II DVD
