million free radio its

80
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,240
I'm I'd like sister

81
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,740
just kicker sub like to say

82
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,090
this minute he didn't have all the
dressing the implications are

83
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,360
the recent SEC decision to legalize
low-power

84
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,430
yeah but although it might sound its
users

85
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,520
out legalization this

86
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,460
most Claire dollars I see it is that s

87
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,970
L yeah for the SEC

88
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,760
means you can only have station 10
months for 100 class

89
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,560
which isn't all that bad actor largest
cities like New York City and Los

90
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,260
Angeles

91
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,610
Chicago believe oil yeah

92
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,700
number two largest cities there is no
ruler yes

93
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,540
for new radio stations so legalization

94
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,550
that occurred I St scheme and a

95
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,960
January 28 is actually now but

96
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,100
victory for him which is why I'm a lot
faster

97
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,970
were concerned team fight to the
airwaves

98
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,890
now there's a never reasons way we
believe that

99
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,030
Airways 3 spreader slogan

100
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:12,940
here must free the electromagnetic
spectrum

101
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,390
we all know it comprises review yours

102
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,610
me the radio frequency and X-rays higher

103
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,540
let your next actions ways that we can
see even

104
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,740
feel the affected by doesn't lose the
visual spectrum

105
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,419
so the SEC I where some low-power

106
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,710
radio stations to Mike lessons from them

107
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,850
seems to me a little ridiculous and
something that

108
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,970
happily accept because as

109
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,640
as I said for person

110
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:53,530
rescissions to get places little bit
late for some people to you

111
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,680
apply for licenses color green is our

112
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,539
electromagnetic spectrum another
government offices that effort to the

113
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:04,890
Communications Act of 1934

114
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,090
the SEC really doesn't have any
jurisdiction over

115
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,120
interested transmissions 20

116
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,289
concerned mostly with interstate between
stagehands ish

117
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:18,560
so there the SEC has been so effective

118
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,940
closing down small stations and thirty
what

119
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,210
was the media's 510 miles

120
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,479
schools another ish

121
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,370
fact that the characteristic too much
control no

122
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,810
the government just happened and its own
accord these

123
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,110
instances tax tiller's its

124
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,940
its activity other questions large
corporations

125
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,920

the user advertise so with a wireless
station

149
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,970
similar to what you see years

150
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,970
essentially the structure

151
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,640

156
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,310
this experi- that effectively controlled

157
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,350
most we here in Seattle large

Troy most media there most Miller where

290
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,710
as I what happens with Kayla

291
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:30,710
figure out artist actors I guess the
most important them

292
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,760
future

293
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,700
everyone knows that the hackers are
cutting-edge six years word

294
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,410
rest the culture regions that with her

295
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,990
the UK treats hero computer network with
me

296
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,890
Voice activated

297
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,820
I have the station transmit

298
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:57,020
the other computers network and with the
voice recognition technology

299
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,129
eyes pro be here

300
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,440
becoming more and more here future

301
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,290
returned different users in different
areas

302
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,379
near so your when you're worried about
being discovered

303
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,140
%um they were trader figure out where
her

304
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,690
home we're here act and they will just
trying to locate

305
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,790
triangulate one location and a

306
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:26,020
I think own network and it might just be
run by one

307
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,220
first may or may not present with a
tanker

308
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,810
wireless station anywhere you want here

309
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,620
I is going up voice-activated record

310
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,860
so in some ways higher

311
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,400
video over wireless radio transmissions
really

312
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,810
provide safe for for a lot of things
that happen guess

313
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,149
taking all I

314

531
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,509
stores matter

532
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,650
keepers Dr

and stores are last 10 years

534
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,440
or you know ideally by

535
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,910
records same right leading

536
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,940
for sliding but

537
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,320
the you mean we do know that s er's
relatively

538
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,080
expected well Charlize 10 years I guess

539
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,990
their saying with young people talking
about this

540
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,360
true gonna stop us from do this i mean
you know

541
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,470
whatever the number is he's out music no
one can stop us

542
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:32,710
was out there doctors I

543
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:37,110
do it you know Sarkozy that's great but
we've seen

544
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,910
the industry's ban together you know
technology awesome

545
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:44,670
in the short term no less than a
thousand times music but

546
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,890
you know when it starts becoming a
hostile finds player

547
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,040
on all your hitters writers all rain

548
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,390
and there's no one out there service and

549
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,290
next

550
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,490
an hour places is something that has or
something that is better

551
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,580
abuse terror whatever

552
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,380
years get harder and harder and
hopefully we'll be able to

553
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,050
you know whatever tech you know means a
restrictor

554
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,210
place for Abels you to those

555
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,150
ways for but there's gonna be University

556
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:21,359
pointers anywhere way too difficult to
do that or the loss just

557
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,328
absolutely on our side use tactics

558
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:29,740
source next mass-producing

559
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,470
so you know again

560
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:37,309
don't take for granted this down to go
away

561
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:40,440
probably not next couple of months

562
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,470
but next few years potentially
experienced RTC

563
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,950
lazar restricting treatment never
mattered

564
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,970
using rest

565
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:56,640

prices for making them car their own
continue at the same price

624
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:37,960
and continue and artists the same about

625
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,380
