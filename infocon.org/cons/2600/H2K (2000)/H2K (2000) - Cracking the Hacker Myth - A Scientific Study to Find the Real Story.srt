research experts work for you engine
powerful enough to pay

70
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,960
who we are seeing you stand let's take a
look at

71
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,198
study why is it that we engage

72
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,349
in studying all the usual ago and

73
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:34,509
for us going together in nursing is that
there was a longish

74
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:39,229
strangely fourteen years hackers
wonderful things that happens again

75
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:42,550
and me han should begin to wonder

76
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,879
why it is pushing stuff in the news

77
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,159
or what's being reported by shorties
because from

78
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:53,180
from the organization behavioral
perspective in business perspective

79
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,180
most started his reading media

80
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,590
interesting secrets from sorties do not
make any sense whatsoever

81
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,229
and so consequently we came to your
belief that happen again

82
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,550
is misunderstood and grossly
misrepresented public

83
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,749
sure objective became to be traded spill
something amiss

84
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:16,120
and providing public in organizations
with a balanced view

85
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,159
arch had Packers in society in the
contributions

86
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,419
only 1e

87
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:28,389

97
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:08,240
been done to try to properly represent

for the last few we've been working with

109
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,039
at Cummings also known as bring us

and thanks Ken up INS

114
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:14,009
an email from a this bernie S doctor

115
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:17,729
bring shell I'll early last year

116
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:20,960
but she apparently been trying to track
down for

117
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,259
couple months I'll unsuccessfully hammy

118
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:27,580
telephone boxes you go through

119
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,159
first but I was quite surprised to hear
somebody had gone to such effort to try

120
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,830
try again

121
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,990
from whatever reason and

122
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,770
she got to talking with you about this
study they were they were trying to

123
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,279
conduct and I was very interested in it
because I

124
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,640
I call you in seeing all these
misrepresentations in the press

125
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,760
an aide myself in to jack it is a
misrepresentation to the press and by

126
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,520
law enforcement past

127
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,630
and I thought anything that can be done
to

128
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,689
help dispel some these
misrepresentations

129
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,750
and are present an objective viewpoint
%uh

130
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,890
I what hackers are about in

131
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,740
in the grand scheme of things would be a
good idea

132
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,020
they certainly been very lopsided view

133
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,490
in the public mind thanks to various

134
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,950
government law enforcement agencies and
the media who just doesn't take the time

135
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,740
to thoroughly research and investigate
stories

136
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,390
rate keep it nine at ten stories and

137
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,990
in Press newspapers web sites television
radio

138
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,950
you'll find just as Kevin mention just

139
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,500
explanations that make no sense
logically or or

140
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,810
for any reason are so up

141
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,550
hopefully this study will on me give
them an updated

142
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,860
put together some real statistics is too
%uh

143
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,820
the makeup hackers with their with your
goals motivations are

144
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,580
who they are %ah demographics as for
everything they don't wanna know your

145
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,570
needs

146
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,820
%uh any money music that touches me

147
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,840
by my late November can easily

148
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,730
weekend %uh I have actually work for
these people on the same for

149
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,130
by email for the past six months your
cell and found them to be here

150
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,360
tree above board I was a little
apprehensive initially thinking well

151
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,320
what's there what's your motivation here
sis another round

152
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,020
slanted study and back I think you're
being rejected

153
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,400
and we'll have something to gain

154
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,830
here by helping them do this study so I
would

155
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,770
strongly encourage anybody are here to
stop by the table using

156
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,100
your hallway here pick up another
surveys on

157
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,280
ATV seeded being interviewed by 10 for

158
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,370
what is it and 50 minutes it's a short
talk

159
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,180

we and getting put in just a few samples
of

189
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,290
some quotations within the last few
months from various different media

190
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:49,930
sources

191
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,810
on juries different topics but about
hackers

Anne would like to get you in Porter
reaction

193
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,970
to use as we go elsewhere say nearly go
through in recent quotes headlines

194
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:07,740
any anybody like to come up in give your

first one me from London Free Press
nothing petty

196
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,810
body claim

197
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,160
any hackers deserve to be treated as the
criminals

198
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,260
they are the story continues

199
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,360
hackers hurricane to fire senators
people who get their jollies by setting

200
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,020
buildings alight and watching

201
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,620
gleefully from a distance as flames
licked the sky

202
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,430
consider using matches hackers use
computer viruses and programs designed

203
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,920
to

204
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,950
on março computer

205
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,920
people may have a sneaking admiration
for young hackers use technical seeking

206
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,300
for all corporate giants

207
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,980
but thats misplaced admiration NASA also
want to admire the demolition skills an

208
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,920
arsonist

209
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,760

212
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:08,910
CTS

213
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,010
this is actually a column

214
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,020
I but aside from the you whoever scribe
debt

215
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:32,020
what do you think to content

216
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:03,329
bank

217
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:17,749

the you the

219
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:46,139
yeah I had

220
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:54,350
pic justice me K

221
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,710
okay

222
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:23,710
okay its former columnist

223
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:47,720
week

224
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,640
okay right you not trying to get to

225
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,810
actually knowing differentiate who's who
I am just going to move on because we

226
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,500
have a number of

227
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,680
give approach explain interjected

228
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,430
now everyone 10-year NC concede that for
what it is

229
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,199
but for the average member the public

230
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,319
who may not have any exposure to are

231
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,899
needy computers at all origin people who
are treated in their use

232
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,750
%uh I would think that is a good
percentage in public

233
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,230
might swallow this carnage and there's
just

234
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,520
very little in the way it balanced
information be

235
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,700
County media and Ashley I think he's
such a kind

236
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,010
trying to do is to actually getting
accurate data put together

237
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,420
scientific study are present their
findings

238
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,550
and up we have that covered in

239
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,409
made available to it will be mailed made
available at one sitting here and in

240
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,170
fact she

241
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,940
you should get an early captivity you
conducted

242
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,480
on India any questions

243
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,940
but a wink wink okay next one is a
statement about

244
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,490
Essex there's a vacuum in cyberspace in
it you need to be new ways of teaching

245
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,740
right from wrong

246
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,740
and usually wake and related recent
computer crimes

247
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,860
and he's gonna focus on G bottom quote

248
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,520
and standards of conduct a guide online
as you promise on the notion that we're

249
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,250
going to have to face to face

250
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,300
relations meet people but in the virtual
world

251
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,889
that we enforce me dissipates maybe I
can see

252
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:36,890
comment what you think statement d

253
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,930
kick

254
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,230
okay so you think it is ethics disappear
because

255
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:11,230
your online

256
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:31,960
all

257
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:38,960
me

258
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,880
K anymore

259
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:20,960
me

260
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:33,000
yeah I'm I have a question before we
continue can you hear in the back

261
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,980
on somebody's making the comments of fun
it probably I think if people might come

262
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,169
up to the mikes on

263
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:46,169
or Mike here we let one go 6 sketch

264
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,880
researches actually being funny

265
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,050
wire shelves its independent
incorporation sees

266
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:14,210
donating any money we wanted to keep
backing stuff head

267
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:18,930
we I can speak like in a sense on the
principal research along with Bernie

268
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,550
shell

269
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,490
a.m. we're funding our normal activity
were employed by the University as

270
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,230
professors this is part of our academic
research level

271
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,960
were personally funding the travel for
this out of our own professional loans

272
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,060
university this year

273
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,300
we could have sought in fact 'em

274
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,660
up support for this and we didn't wanna
tarnishes and so we actually got a

275
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,300
little branch much small business

276
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,040
development unit in the University and a
few other things but it's there's no

277
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,800
external financing at all for this
project and its

278
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,840
we're trying to keep as clean as its

279
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:57,840
them hard but it's is we're a bit about
shoestring is a common

280
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:20,780
well I can I think I could start to
comment and then turned over to

281
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:26,129
Burnett a.m. we picked the question was
where do we plan to publish this

282
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,160
information

283
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,030
and and in what form um we plan to

284
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:35,889
I guess that look at the history bernie
has published a couple recent books by

285
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:40,110
in and we would probably we may in the
publishing a book or some other material

286
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:44,060
but that's down the road we planned to
publish some %uh the

287
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,770
I'll work on 2600 a

288
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:51,139
we've if you fill out the form and
itself

289
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,150
will give you back an individual
assessment of

290
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,400
whole of this we're using standard
techniques in the in the

291
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,540
in this reform we plan to use credible

292
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,680
sources tell us not to say that was sold
at one end up in the public media as

293
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,160
well

294
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,000
a but I may be burning today red yes

295
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
we really trying to keep this

296
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,200
as objective as possible reporting

297
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,590
so as we would typically do on any map
return our call me

298
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,669
minutes late the mean response the

299
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,460
standard deviations in group responses
primarily

300
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:33,020
and that group levels that no individual
could feel the history danny is in any

301
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,270
way

302
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,870
being lease I we've already been
contacted by

303
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,620
number media people I guess desperate

304
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,750
to have her findings I the one member in
there

305
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,940
we have trusted so far in this came
after

306
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,840
bernie asses are reviewing situation

307
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,879
I is Andreas his team from

308
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,400
came Broadcasting Corporation Toronto
Andreas

309
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,740
dance show called undercurrents and I
guess

310
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:10,330
many ways he's considered to be in
trouble and the media feeling because he

311
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,949
likes searching for the truth

312
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,160
and not popular answer so

313
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,460
Bernie s has spoken to Andreas

314
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,450
for number hours understand it and

315
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,530
that is the only media group that we had
committed to enhance my understanding

316
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,610
that

317
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,430
they are coming to interview bernie &
ass

318
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:36,610
your colleagues actually coming into
coming I personally could make it this

319
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,220
weekend

320
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,850
the conference for cost reasons there
they're coming and Tuesday

321
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:44,840
to on interviews with people involved
the artillery shell

322
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,350
and down actual departed the study is
geared towards

323
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:53,520
activism as well he wanted to cover that
NC

324
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,150
indication they're very churchy and she
told me

325
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,770
in a study on is really no real

326
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:05,379
scientific data it's been available to
the public option is being

327
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:10,140
and anecdotal information on there may
be some government studies done by

328
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,900
long fortune agencies that certainly you
can't necessarily expect to be

329
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,250
unbiased on norm is publicly available

330
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,710
so on is really in

331
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,400
gonna be an open book had Indonesian
responds

332
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,080
not the issue did not anyone know your
name is necessary she want copied or

333
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,510
something

334
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:34,750
in any case a your answers you can be
compiled with but all the others in

335
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,960
and used his sickly it's not not
anything you need to be concerned about

336
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,260
your individual

337
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,270
responses be index to you

338
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:49,270
I'm

339
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,950
no i i its

340
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:23,160
I think what I'd like to address that
directly what I was trying to say

341
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,150
really and I'm trying to skip over
things quickly as we're trying to make

342
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,330
the data accessible

343
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:32,230
and that's why we say 2600 we're using
we're going to use standard test this is

344
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,350
a very Scion the

345
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,380
these are well-established questions
that were using for you can use good

346
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,250
statistical tests on it to be

347
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,590
have to be peer review you know we have
to yet and we have in fact before we

348
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,840
could even delivered here

349
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,080
we had to get this approved by the
universe the ethics committee

350
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,419
before we could be sliver here so this
we have to go through hoops player not

351
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,380
before we can even

352
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,580
administer this early in a satisfactory
as being ethically done

353
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,010
and the date is gonna be properly done
don't was once we get back home

354
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,129
and that if we say it's confidential we
have our own ethics

355
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,780
with you people to say what you doing I
mean it's it's just his party this

356
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,899
academic community in Canada anyway they
take it very seriously

357
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:17,900
I don't know him answer your question
but I'm trying

358
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,659
are

359
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:31,940
I

360
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,789
I i think that the way to address it the
best way to get back

361
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:38,230
accurate information as get as many
people as possible to fill out a survey

362
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:38,779
for

363
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:44,369
if we do have but at 10 quacks fill out
the form then we go back data if we get

364
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:47,779
a couple hundred people here that we
have are still at the 10 quacks it ought

365
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:49,359
not to ask you to get daily

366
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,980
it's a concern of ours so we really need
your help if you want to have a

367
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,850
legitimate

368
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:57,080
a profile of what you that you

369
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,330
was one one person said earlier they
felt

370
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,689
I we interpret it to the this is not a
homogeneous community this as some

371
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,609
some black cats and has some white hats
and some put people in some bad people

372
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:12,439
and there's a different ride you people
and I think we have a special group here

373
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,989
and we have to make sure we get a good
cross-section

374
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:19,369
not just a few people and eventually
will turn out nicely II

375
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:23,179
I don't mean uptake too much but I okay
I think we should do wish

376
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:27,080
shoal of fish he had question me comment
period later

377
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,109
me if anybody wants to stay after they
reached between six and seven years

378
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:34,049
know whether a panel discussion during
that time you want to talk to us to be

379
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:34,590
great

380
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:38,529
just want to move on we have a couple
other interesting ones just look at

381
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:39,450
richard Young

382
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:44,039
am me put football team looking

383
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:47,470
and at shirt from corporate SB Nation

384
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,769
I winkler makes a statement almost all
hackers are little more than

385
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:56,419
nuisances change he knows that there's
only about 200

386
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,759
a 200 hackers in existence in the world
any

387
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,929
only the user's computer geniuses any
comments on that

388
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:10,929
can can you come up to the microphone
show really

389
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,140
yeah week what we'd like to do actually
is good

390
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,400
she'd actually also scripps

391
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,610
in we do know dead here are and meaning
which identified

392
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,790
hackers term crackers is used script
kiddies

393
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,870
wherein students and there are

394
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:28,920
different behavior said state people can
identify it

395
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:35,360
people here whereas dudes have specific
activities in a case like to focus on

396
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,850
and would like to understand why the
focus on school what makes

397
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,700
when mixing te quite like to do that
which the patient today

398
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:49,700
provide for society hey function me

399
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,010
he

400
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:58,510
week

401
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,560
okay we do have some questions in here
to train

402
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:07,030
differentiate people based on the type
of activity litigation

403
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:11,740
and then what we can do will be doing
some statistical analysis based on some

404
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,090
things responses to see

405
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,160
word is we have a group joining up have
been

406
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,410
consultation with Shay Eric Raymond to
get

407
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:24,040
his feedback in others action unity

408
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,490
as to differentiation techniques for

409
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,600
Packers pushes every entry and

410
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,490
money she elements take people seem to
misunderstand

411
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,890
shorties and media seem to misunderstand
is the notion

412
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:41,020
tent you think a lot of lawyers

413
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,600
been involved in these cases which
really focus on content

414
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,120
isn't any is which you the

415
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,310
differentiates whether or not you
intentional community claim

416
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:56,000
more actually community claim even if a
crime was no action itself

417
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,850
yes we do have some questions and
they're banging

418
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,690
spell to you exactly what they are
because we don't ship lies in Italy

419
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:10,690
stay results okay

420
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:24,970
a

421
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:33,260
kisch which any I quickly agree in your
comments

422
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,680
actually you having gone through his
book H did not find any references to

423
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,430
support any statement that he had made

424
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:42,470
and but I saw doesn't introduce it to
see

425
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:47,270
what people's perspectives was on the
subject since it is he was actually a

426
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,620
este guest speaker back in

427
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:53,680
94 at hope me and a friend and I we had
a min at 97

428
00:33:53,680 --> 00:34:00,680
attend beyond hope okay energy

429
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:08,190
it's really sinking me okay

430
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,909
this is a great a really great
interesting article

431
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:15,099
it's a guy saying why are there so few

432
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:20,659
female hacker's shan't ask anybody who
purports you know

433
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:25,230
from national expert and catch to you
MIT several researchers churchill coltie

434
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,319
Michael so well

435
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:29,918
also important jeering Packers at
unanimous had gmail

436
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,270
especially male as exchange

437
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:38,329
he continues to say it's a testosterone
problem

438
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:44,230
women into hacking from the same general
reason that women are not interested in

439
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:50,280
vandalizing stop signs cars their knees
drawn to the hostile elements

440
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,569
cyberspace séminaire and

441
00:34:54,569 --> 00:35:00,490
best one he's in a bit competence women
have the brains and skills to hack

442
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:05,040
but they're more interested in building
communities im 13 and Exchange

443
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:11,799
like web design a creative any comments
about the subject

444
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:17,559
winning and creativity I

445
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:21,280
he said idyllic

446
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:28,280
okay over here he hitch

447
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:36,980
he can

448
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:48,130
and in the back here

449
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,240
here's a quick traditional flavoring
this

450
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,400
in this colony cash if you read the
whole thing I do have a copy

451
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,480
edition your body was to have a good him
using read

452
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,870
come fish me nothing in here it is
actually correct factual

453
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,890
but is publishing hey escaped rhetoric

454
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:23,890
you just move on election

455
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,560
your question was whether or not we have
shorty

456
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,650
checking any statistic song males
shemale populous

457
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:43,410
yes we are we do have questions should
reach think Erica told Mediaset

458
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:50,410
doing guesstimate stack 15 percent
winning

459
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,720
stick issues a great day great article

Anne image new software SAT

461
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:17,579
and thing I'd like to focus on is the
statement a is software can

462
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:21,849
shank like a hacker was a hacker sank
like

463
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:25,119
yeah K

tiny can't roll hacker kevin Mitnick

473
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,299
advises CIO's to hackers hysterical

474
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:45,990

circumventing security measures

experience in education

476
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:55,609
kevin also argues plenty recall that
some computer planned community

477
00:38:55,609 --> 00:38:58,900
intellectual curiosity rather than those
are for personal gain

478
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,579
adding just because someone's been
arrested for hacking doesn't mean and

479
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:03,470
criminal

480
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:06,829
so for which you may recall

481
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:10,510

need to hire a hacker you never gonna

486
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,460
catch ahead

487
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,210
before bringing hackers into the Hall of
jewish NCAA

488
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:35,150
CIO magazine reports are for items CIO
should seriously weighing

489
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:38,319
fledgling comments

been done if a hacker candidate has held

00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:50,040
other corporate positions in addition

493
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,270

499
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,510
is officially cation me most anguishing

500
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,069
actually illegal purposes would not take
the time to become certified

501
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:19,160
shore if a hacker can any

or systems network administrators
professional

504
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,490
it's a good sign hacker does not have
the legal

505
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:34,230
intentions came she

use the word hacker

620
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:17,240
quite liberally in this presentation
it's not an invention in the nineties

621
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,310
read in the eighties

622
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:22,840
term hacker goes all the way back to the
regional model train enthusiasts back at

623
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,640
MIT

624
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,450
who I guess you could say are
responsible for the creation of the

625
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:28,030
Internet

626
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:31,550
for the maintenance of the Internet for
the personal computer

627
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:34,700
in just about every other modern
computing device we have in the world

628
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,320
today

629
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,780
to vilify such a wide variety people

630
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:42,950
in a broad stroke as other people
pointed out is a grave injustice

631
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:47,430
and of course are criminals in all
aspects of society

632
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:51,000
even within the hacker community butter
cheese hacker in literature

633
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,450
sense is think a misunderstanding about
