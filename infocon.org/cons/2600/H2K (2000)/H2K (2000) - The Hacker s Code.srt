1
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,739
let's rock and roll what you think

2
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:41,620
so welcome to the 1 o'clock session in
the Paris room

3
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,720
I've h2k so we're not really in the
Paris rheumatism really wanna clock

4
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,370
are I think that I'm break newbie I was

5
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:55,550
this morning and what I'm here to talk
about is something that we've covered

6
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,530
really I

7
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,190
in almost every session to some extent
it's really got an earful love for the

8
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,640
last hour hour-and-a-half

9
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,909
which is basically ethics and as

10
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:10,060
some you might know the process for Age
UK was to send in a proposal with ideas

11
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,460
that you might have about to

12
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,929
about presentations and I said in a
presentation saying well

13
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:19,550
I think what I'm interested in is
talking about hacker ethics

14
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,570
but from the point of view are the
approach I wanna take

15
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,690
is this evening what we have in common
that we might be able to

16
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,759
to write down to say well here's here's

17
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,259
what is that hackers are here's what it
is that hackers steal and the

18
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,399
inspiration for this

19
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,280
was our continuing efforts to be

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,530
I I not vilified Tisei

21
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,360
to the press and stuff like that K
hacker is not a bad word

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,909
Packers are by and large ethical people
pursuing

23
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,170
goals which are maybe lofty maybe not
Salafi but

24
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,460
but often now I'm our goals that are
ethically

25
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,509
or on otherwise not motivated by malice
and and stuff like that

26
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,979
so if we take that as a starting point
the next question becomes well

27
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,478
you know what sort of code do we want
could could we actually write this down

28
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,070
to get something we might agree upon and
what I was really gonna do for this

29
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,078
session when we're going to be in the
old Paris room and if you haven't been

30
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,640
there

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,140
be glad that we're not are was actually
type on my laptop and do

32
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,269
mom the audience participation and
instead what I did was I since laptops

33
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:28,310
there and I'm here

34
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,010
West come up with some notes to artwork
us through

35
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,910
let me just to introduce myself
extremely briefly I'm not

36
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,340
a professor at the University North
Carolina in Chapel Hill

37
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,060
and I teach in the school love library
an inch knows information library

38
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,889
science

39
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:49,380
they reverse that so on I'm based in
information scientists I teach in the

40
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,250
areas assistance ministration duel in
exports to

41
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,209
information security for stuff like that
is this kind thing that I'm interested

42
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:56,540
in

43
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,970
and our are may have been published in
2600 magazine but not under my name

44
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,730
and have an interest in this %uh for
quite some time

45
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,820
I did get a cease and desist letter from
the MPAA

46
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,540
and have a page about that because I the
the University Council

47
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,850
at the University of North Carolina are
basically censored

48
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,030
my course they force me to take down my
DVD stuff that I was teaching

49
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,660
for my Alexis administration class so I
i've an interest in the side thing

50
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,720
right if we can not be depressed next
please

51
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,769
roll-on move forward to the to the next
screen

52
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,340
what I did as a starting point to sort
of disorder

53
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,260
a warm up your intellectual juices was
think about some potential sample some

54
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:40,858
some

55
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:46,440
that these these are more like God not
models for more like this things EA

56
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,079
thinking about the idea

57
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:52,280
other common code lol will look at all
three these in no particular order

58
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,459
and the first one is not ivanovo called
a code

59
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:58,959
but as a statement probably la did you
read it and they would go ahead to that

60
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,889
firstly I'm the hackers manifesto
actually did bring

61
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:07,900
on some printed copies lesser those you
that haven't seen it I will I'll leave

62
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,900
it on a table in the networking room
later on

63
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,919
we go ahead with the

64
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,959
with hackers manifesto in your chance

65
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,919
this was %uh ridin in 1986

66
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,680
by gentlemen who is spending some
unfortunate

67
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,680
to time as a were to the state

68
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,470
out yet you click Next please sorry I
wasn't there

69
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,720
thanks and now what we're doing nothing
to read this whole thing gives it'll

70
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,220
take a little longer than I want to do

71
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,840
but if you scroll down a little bit I'll
tell you when to stop there are two

72
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,190
paragraphs I wanna read

73
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,600
star keep going so keep going

74
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,600
more more MORE

75
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,330
on sorry do our is actually that the
paragraph that at the top

76
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:08,330
and let's go that in the the previous
paragraph was just read this

77
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,090
I'll read it to you in case well I wrong
to read i read it to you just think just

78
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,350
in case you can see it

79
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,210
this is our world now the world the
electron and a switch the beauty of the

80
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,130
baud we make use the service

81
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,400
Ave service already existing without
paying for what could be dirt cheap it

82
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,570
was a run by profiteering gluttons

83
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,630
and you call as criminals we explore any
college criminals we seek after

84
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,390
knowledge any college criminals

85
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,440
we exist without skin color without
nationality without religious bias

86
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,760
and you call us criminals you build
atomic bombs you age wars

87
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,900
you murder cheat and lie to us and try
to make us believe it's for our own good

88
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,360
yet where the criminals

89
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,810
as good as low morale get the next
paragraph thank you

90
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,480
yes I'm a criminal my crime is outta
curiosity

91
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,650
my crime is at a judging people by what
they say and think

92
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,100
not what they look like my crime is
outta outsmarting you something that you

93
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,610
will never forgive me for

94
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,610
this sound familiar sure if you read the
first part

95
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,090
this is essentially a kind of an angry
statement

96
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,700
that says hey you know I'm kinda doing
my thing

97
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,770
I'm I'm curious i has some skills

98
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,930
I'm trying to develop those skills and

99
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,720
I'm getting all kinda trouble for 1986
rights is

100
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:32,310
couple years ago there a couple really
good points in here though and in fact I

101
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:32,700
have

102
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,630
I in the next factor in their futures
lie to have a on

103
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:42,610
a couple have these points that come
back to us because what is he saying he

104
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,240
saying he doesn't think much

105
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,690
love are racial separation he doesn't
think much of national

106
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,850
identities he doesn't think much I love
are

107
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,540
corporatism and corporate greed gay

108
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,920
and is trying to get around all these
things trying to trying to come up with

109
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,740
his own way

110
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,770
and out this is the type thing that I
think maybe that and then this of course

111
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,960
as they're ready but I think maybe we
would like to you

112
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,480
put into a code to say here is are here
are some other things out that we

113
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,140
if not all believe that these can agree
are some of the important goals

114
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,770
being a hacker and let's see if we can
let's go ahead to the next one please

115
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:26,770
I'm not gonna read this whole thing
either although I probably live you've

116
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,100
never I read it

117
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,370
normally we think %uh the hippocratic
oath as the thing that doctor is sorta

118
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,510
pulled up and and say I sware to

119
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,880
do no harm right when they get there
there and the

120
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,800
a degree or their license or something
like that the actual

121
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,700
with other parties is quite a bit longer
and more involved includes a buncha

122
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,520
stuff that

123
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,680
to you know normally wouldn't apply

124
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,100
in modern times or Charlie be
questionable and resort that the

125
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,860
shortened version which is our first do
no harm

126
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,760
that's what we usually think others that
they have about a goth back at it a

127
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,880
little better research on this it turns
out that med schools is actually really

128
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,240
different than sort of different
processes that that Andy's go for

129
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,210
but check this out on if we scroll just
a little bit so I can

130
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:15,060
I can not touch upon what's in this
paragraph basically white

131
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,600
the hippocratic oath spends most of its
time probably about half its i'm talking

132
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,060
about.

133
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,880
is various ways in which physicians

134
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,490
act for the good more than for the sale

135
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,310
and this to me is one of the key things
we keep hearing about with the

136
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,349
with the hackers when the comments I
heard yesterday was

137
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,440
arm defacing a web page

138
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,640
is that activism for hacktivism well

139
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,580
if you choose the page to deface for a
reason

140
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,200
and then death they said then possibly
at sounds like it is

141
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,820
if you simply to face whatever page you
could debase because I was the place you

142
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,010
could break into well

143
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,300
you know maybe not okay and this is
typeof in 10

144
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,620
that I think the I'll the hacker code
might want to address

145
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,540
this budget stuff in here that they talk
about done are giving a border against

146
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,150
to

147
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,339
I two women they talk about pass through

148
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,440
a pessary to produce an abortion and I
don't know how many people even had a

149
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,970
pass re I'm not sure I think

150
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,480
I think I saw one in the hotel
restaurant but are

151
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,940
I you know that this is a little bit
archaic but the idea that out I really

152
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,700
want to emphasize you're not going to
one other example

153
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,950
is I spent a lot of time talking about
how

154
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,150
doctors at which is who this is for
positions

155
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:38,100
medicine nurse teach and that i think is
really a big piece

156
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,100
something we've heard a lot about with
the with the hackers

157
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,650
hackers tend to be individuals on the
one hand

158
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,750
and yet we tend to get a lot of our
knowledge about hacking

159
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,910
from other hackers for there's there's
this community

160
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,170
so yeah you know ultimately we're all
gonna go home will be sitting alone

161
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,349
again

162
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,280
you known for the computer late at night
or early in the morning or whatever it

163
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,800
is

164
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,770
not be incredibly social perhaps but
what are we doing we're sharing by email

165
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,280
Jack are I've group stuff like that

166
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,660
so this idea passing on knowledge is
something that i think is really

167
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,339
important and it has

168
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,170
as you see this is a the point here long
history with the

169
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,719
I have a credit growth I let's go ahead
and take a look at laws robotics for a

170
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,420
second

171
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,969
and these are these are little bit
arbitrary on to the next slide please

172
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,230
the these are a little bit arbitrary
that I i chose these particular examples

173
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,570
but I thought there are well known and
and kinda fun in each had a couple of

174
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,360
points that I wanna grab onto

175
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,050
arm Packers are now robots are not
trying to make this argument but take a

176
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,440
look at the zeroth law

177
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,459
a lot of people heard about the laws a
robotics I thought they were three laws

178
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,560
robotics and as mark came up with

179
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,420
and originally there were and on there
is a story

180
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,670
I i think that I had a couple a virgin's
this in fact but

181
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,439
robot's name buyer where to a father

182
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,820
as mobs robot characters were talking
with each other over a period of some

183
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,440
I recall hundreds or thousands of years

184
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,650
and they came up on their own with the
zeroth law love %uh

185
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:17,339
robotics a robot may not injure humanity

186
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:22,000
or through inaction allow humanity to
come to harm

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,320
this is I think sometimes pretty close

188
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,650
to white Packers use as a measuring
stick

189
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,579
what their what their %ah purposes that

190
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:36,660
maybe not thinking about the benefit if
the man im apnea

191
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:43,660
how many actually are benefiting
humanity immediately and directly

192
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,839
but the idea that for example well
anti-corporate

193
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,510
behavior may be illegal and I or
behavior could be in the good of

194
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,500
humanity

195
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,930
be for that right the idea that well
i'll know

196
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,930
email viruses our problem and we can
help you madly by doing something about

197
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,700
done

198
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,339
about email viruses may be releasing a
virus in the long run

199
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:06,440
non-religious virus is a way of
achieving that

200
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,660
to back all been good for the thematic

201
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,699
so that doesn't want to focus on there
was this the rose law which emerged job

202
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,880
are really after a couple of decades the
the robots books from asthma

203
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,220
and after that but sure they they apply
all that da all that directly to the

204
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,790
first line certainly

205
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,520
that you're not injuring human beings as
another CAS that we seem to have

206
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,189
as hackers is that well

207
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,800
what we're doing might be Misha might be
an inconvenience

208
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,910
might cost some one time or money and
that's that's really

209
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,020
I where some people I draw the line

210
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,589
between for the white hat and a black
cat by

211
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:47,800
there's a clear line I love are actual

212
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,589
you know bodily harm or more on or
injury

213
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:54,950
to other people and

214
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,360
that's something that I think most
actors would agree with his

215
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,860
very much if there's if there is a line
between white hat Blackadder

216
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,600
good acts bad acts or whatever it is
that the idea of

217
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,810
are hurting people really comes in there
so let's go to the next slide and what I

218
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,250
did

219
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:16,140
on as I mentioned what I really want to
do was sit here and and type on my way

220
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,660
out

221
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,110
on my laptop and get points from the
audience and

222
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,690
because I wasn't gonna be all the tight
I sorta dreamed up a few

223
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,950
and I'm not sure how much I like a man
what I did was I numbered them

224
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:30,439
I is that having a ball that lesser
something like that in order that we can

225
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:31,240
provide a little

226
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,140
a little the back are you wanted you
want to try to type comments

227
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,370
now the 5d like

228
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:44,160
let some are baby just work through the
couple of points that I have

229
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,000
and than that you know I did this on my
own this might be total bullshit

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,240
you know maybe maybe not maybe it's not
going to work that's actually a question

231
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,189
i'd like

232
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:56,680
people in the audience help with is
worthwhile is something we never

233
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,059
possibly agree with that

234
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:02,300
agree on and other of course it only
makes sense

235
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,670
if it's not just people in this room
that see this you know it only makes

236
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,540
sense if we get this publishing 2600

237
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,469
something like that WEA if we actually
reply

238
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,819
so one issue does is make any sort of
sense let's take a look at some of the

239
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:21,130
are some other points then maybe get a
lot of feedback and things and change

240
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,449
I I thought I in the in the true spirit

241
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:28,010
love your I Declaration of Independence
and constitution stuff like that in the

242
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,160
preamble

243
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,140
right so I put in the preamble something
about diverse the hackers are divers

244
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,230
from all cultures and backgrounds every
hackers unique yet we all share some

245
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,589
characteristics

246
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:41,110
well not every hacker follows this code
we're reading

247
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,650
many believe it is a fair description
ever share traditions goals and values

248
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,819
and up doesn't really say too much but
but the idea recognizing diversity

249
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:52,819
and common characteristics is something
that that

250
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:55,959
I think will come up again a stroll down
a little bit we'll just sorta breeze

251
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:57,410
through these

252
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,760
and and then go into a little more
interactive mode

253
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,880
hacker shared a willing to teach their
knowledge so I

254
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,750
are taking up a cue from the poverty is

255
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,860
teaching and sharing I seems to be an
important role

256
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,250
and and we know that there's there's
issues a right we know that there's a

257
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,339
lot of problems with our

258
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:21,030
you know being on a mailing list for
being in a chatroom someone comes along

259
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,670
and says they can you please tell me did

260
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,150
you know make viruses or %ah

261
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,280
I how do you make a bomber how to use
your phone service get free phone

262
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,829
service or something like that

263
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:34,949
and people that do that don't tend to
get a whole lot of answers

264
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:38,380
right so we know that and yet at the
same time

265
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,220
we know that those of us have developed
some sorta skills over the years

266
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,420
a really spent a lot of time interacting
with other hackers to

267
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,130
to tune those skills and share those
skills & Cheryl we've

268
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,400
only discovered okay hackers are skilled

269
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,800
are many are self taught her by
interactive that hackers hacker seek

270
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,709
knowledge number three

271
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:00,760
this knowledge may come from
unauthorized or unusual sources and is

272
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,819
often hidden

273
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:04,839
as information scientist by the way I
don't think too much

274
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,270
the idea that information must be free
and

275
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,579
it's not because I don't think it must
be free in fact the three-part I agree

276
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:12,260
with

277
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,870
but the information part I believe
information is something that you make

278
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,809
it someone tells you

279
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,040
what you know there's not a lot of
information there

280
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,069
right so the information value is really
in its on

281
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:27,750
in his uniqueness or his ability to to
contribute to our knowledge

282
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,170
in that sense I think information does
doesn't wanna be free but I know about

283
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,230
at work size and too much

284
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,819
hackers are tinkerers I like to
understand how things work wanna make

285
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:37,540
their own a proven

286
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,230
modifications five attackers often
disagree with authority including

287
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,900
parents employers social customs and
laws to name a few

288
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,630
they often seek to get around authority
they disagree with hackers disagree with

289
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,439
each other I think that's important to
note

290
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:54,349
different hackers have different values
income from all backgrounds this means

291
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,850
that what one hackers opposed to might
be embraced by another

292
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,150
let's roll down the end please are
almost the end

293
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:06,809
Packers are persistent and are willing
to devote hours days and years sometimes

294
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:09,149
decades for those either in the
old-timers

295
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,660
panel this morning to pursuing their
individual passions

296
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,660
this code is not Scott prescribe how
hackers

297
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,189
act instead is that help us to recognize
our own diverse the and identify

298
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:25,370
them and identity how bout every hacker
must make his or her own decisions about

299
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,059
what is right or wrong and some I do
things they believe are a legal

300
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:32,450
a moral or antisocial the Lord's you
might be something you believe is

301
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,559
illegal or immoral

302
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:36,850
as maybe parlance the rose law per box

303
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,639
Packers motivations are their own and
there's no reason for all hackers to

304
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,920
agree I think we need to recognize that
early prolly

305
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,210
are you doing this conference hackers
have a shared identity

306
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,080
identifying and however and many shared
interests and by reading this

307
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,260
code hackers recognize themselves and
each other and understand better the

308
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,300
group that they are apart a

309
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,090
and really that that actually almost the
purpose of having the talk here is a

310
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,970
well who are we and how to identify
ourselves and

311
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,540
and what are some of our shared

312
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,570
not necessarily things we all agree on

313
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,428
but shared things that we can say with
some accuracy about us

314
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:15,530
and I think what I'd like to do having
work through these points is some

315
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,000
assless at some feedback and input from
the audience on

316
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,679
as I said a is this possible may be
desirable

317
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,929
and then be what about some of these
points and money

318
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:31,020
I just the reiterate with a part of what
I said

319
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,200
at the very beginning which is

320
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,370
we get vilified right I hackers are
portrayed as being terrorists are

321
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,110
synonymous with harris et cetera and so
forth

322
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,510
this is a problem one other things that
I think might

323
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:51,250
help could possibly help is if we can
point at something and say no

324
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,540
no wait a minute you're talking about
someone else hear something about what a

325
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,870
hacker is

326
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:00,600
and what you're talking about is while a
criminal or terrorist sir or whatever is

327
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,440
and I think we're pretty good at making
that that distinguish distinction point

328
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:04,850
in

329
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,240
individual conversation and I can only
see it come up sometimes in the media

330
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,840
not too often that certainly and then

331
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,840
mailing lists and stuff like that but
wears a document you know where the

332
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,250
thing that's what explains this

333
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,450
and of what it's worth i won take a
crack at that

334
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,670
so please I said without maybe .1 and
appointed

335
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:29,670
and I'll try to read me go to try to
repeat your comment

336
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,440
yeah

337
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,600
yes not it's not as earlier code is a
dozen prescribed as much as more

338
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:51,050
describing

339
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,790
well you wanna put in a a I O not 90
write a code what we want to put in

340
00:19:54,790 --> 00:20:01,790
that might be a little different you
think

341
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:14,610
please stand up yeah for I can hear you
wat brother be

342
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:23,908
what I was saying was I don't believe
that this code actually constitutes a

343
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:24,849
code because it's

344
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,579
more describing how he feels Packers
acting

345
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:32,769
and doesn't give any direction how
hacker should act a lot of personal

346
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:33,690
statements

347
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,799
it is an all-in-one he believes is going
on

348
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:44,418
on and doesn't

349
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:45,549
hair

350
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:50,090
say close at

351
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,149
exactly on how should they act this is
how he believes iraq

352
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,660
now what about the utility the menu

353
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:04,660
you wanna see something a little
different Wireless

354
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:11,800
be actually

355
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,260
that up

356
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,760
up

357
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,360
there

358
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,340
I think the online

359
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,760
motivation going for as good there's of

360
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,720
to come up to code game duke

361
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,830
to prescribe on how you feel I they
should act

362
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,500
or perform to be ethical and this just
means a lot of

363
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,820
all his lawn work

364
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:54,350
be amazed what courage it takes to do
something like this hacker secure has

365
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:54,960
found

366
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,960
I there's another comment

367
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,100
or someone else but something to say

368
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:13,100
thank you or be given these guidelines
label

369
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,850
wiesel able so important issues that
many people are trying to escape a label

370
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,540
night trying to inflict in with yet
another one I like that arm

371
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,060
is not necessarily important and in fact
I A R as

372
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,149
I think some people do any audience they
interact with the media every once in a

373
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,630
while

374
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,770
as you know where these ways experts or
never I

375
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,270
and arm

376
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:40,970
the problem is they want labels we use
labels

377
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,090
right and so we can escape the label

378
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:49,080
except we can only escaped among
ourselves

379
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,889
you said hackers are vilified by giving
them a label it easier to fill hi them

380
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,680
by giving them a label as a hacker it
easier for the media to vilify these

381
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,100
people

382
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,080
I i agree. how close do this

383
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,899
then one blue is guilty you're guilty by
association with the sleaze

384
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:12,690
it seems like what hackers do is that
they're individuals

385
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,210
they will find the cause mean something
to them by grouping together you will

386
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,250
have disagreements

387
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,930
I don't think you could have one common
goal or guidelines

388
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,470
rules that will guide how people behave
or what they should do

389
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,350
well thank you the on a

390
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,280
let me mention one thing that

391
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,500
I where to go I don't know if that
wasn't arrive in the slides

392
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,200
that is we have a lot of power

393
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,310
I think and I think we might have more
power as a group

394
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:48,070
then individually and so that I think
that's my believe them really motivated

395
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,040
this is a well

396
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,850
if we can maybe get ourselves thinking a
little bit as as a group

397
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:57,000
then we can move forward perhaps more
than that as individuals and and I'm

398
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,430
thinking

399
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,730
my personal thing is is all this
activism going on thinking well you know

400
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,890
what would be different if we can really
get organized somehow and take down

401
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:08,870
the DNC you know that what jo sucking up
that's what the government is afraid of

402
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,980
is a group that they can label
identified

403
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,270
you can't stop individuals is too large
for instance

404
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,310
Rosa robotics unenforceable they mean
nothing

405
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:21,909
to robots and to humans yeah the only
way there forceful that there's

406
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,100
something that's called the

407
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:28,170
pagination laws are some things based
says all the new robots also have to

408
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:28,660
agree

409
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:34,420
can't do that with people right any
other questions or comments

410
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,610
well thanks for coming and

411
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,410
up with us up on the web pages I
mentioned and we continue work on a

412
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,000
little bit

413
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,300
and maybe just a crack throw it out
there for a public consumption or

414
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,040
destruction

415
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,680
as as indicated right will I get on with
the next panel and the

416
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,140
next couple minutes here thanks very
much
