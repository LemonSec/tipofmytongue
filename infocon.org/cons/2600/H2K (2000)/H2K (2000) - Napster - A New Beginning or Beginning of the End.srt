00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,140
I'm here i guess im not really a tech
person

15
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,210
I'll are just graduated from law school
and I'm

16
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,990
I did some research for placed on the
Berkman Center for Internet and Society

17
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,610
I'm at Harvard Law School we put on a
conference on mp3 is very

18
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,759
Anna prince in any kinda like open
source

19
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,150
and how it relates to law basic
technology marches

20
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,950
around check out there their sites I
heard outlawed at Harvard idea

21
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,990
you're interested anyway savers can talk
about I'm

22
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,730
not just the legal stuff I guess for big
picture on

23
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,450
but in general you know what can the law
do in the situation if anything he

24
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,770
should help should be more pro-consumer
should be

25
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,650
know or pro listener pro-army artist and
a

26
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,080
kinda back on question is is music
different and this I'm

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,660
in this context is it different from
other kinds of are

28
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,940
based on when answered a.m.

29
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,709
that projects which have the
palestinians I'll start here with that

30
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:29,320
seeing all my life hi i buy I'm see my
body and often

31
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,350
IIT Jimmy Department of Culture and
communication at New York University

32
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:38,049
I and I'm I'm basically a call for a
store and i

33
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:41,670
which means I've dealt with that whole
lotta pieces of paper and

34
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,720
not that many compressed electronic
files

35
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,109
until recently arm and I i have been
working on a history

36
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,640
copyright for a number of years I only
to find that the very end of my book

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,490
something exploded into the public
consciousness a at just the wrong time

38
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,250
because I'm not yet done with the book

39
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,319
I but that's the way things go I solve
some I find myself

40
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:08,450
I having to talk about mp3 and Napster
in terms of its effect on the copyright

41
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,090
system

42
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,140
in terms of its affect on creativity

43
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,530
commerce and democracy arm and some sort
thrilled with the opportunity the

44
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,170
attention

45
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,030
but officer overwhelmed by the whole
thing on and so if at any point I

46
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,170
seem like I a deer caught in headlights
because he's a really bright headlights

47
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,819
I'm often not that are adept attack
person

48
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,520
arm I I know the culture more than a
technology to sell

49
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,800
that hopefully what I will at going here
knows the law

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,790
and we'll see what also got going on you
know

51
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,590
was a unless low IQ working radio for

52
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,239
I guess about eighty years and

53
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,709
I currently hosts a syndicated radio
feature tech

54
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,720
news updates on about 300 stations
nationwide

55
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,020
I'm I'm will tack blur

56
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,870
and the news report since news reports

57
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,410
are about 10 seconds long these days um

58
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,030
I really don't think this is a tech
issue anymore in terms of

59
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,670
I mean these guys are saying you know
I'm not really tech person I I don't

60
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,140
think

61
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,280
it's about being

62
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,620
technically astute or whatever because
if your bike he know you can download

63
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,479
Napster

64
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,729
and I your I want you work for
university they won't let you

65
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:31,289
and Ray and so and since it is so easy

66
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:34,630
um I think it's kinda

67
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,419
grown into into a bigger issue than oh
this is just

68
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:42,849
tech geeks um we also have some music
artists

69
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,110
here and which I'm excited about because

70
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,490
a lot of the pro issues people say well
this

71
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,620
you know that this is going to really
help the small guys out but is jello is

72
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,490
saying today

73
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,310
is that really happening so turn it over
to these guys

74
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,479
a I'm James Hanna I'm in a band called

75
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,409
airwaves they a whereas yet unsigned so

76
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,979
basically it's a 75 percent of our
distribution

77
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:12,870
is through the web using our our web
page and I

78
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,300
mp3truck.com I really don't

79
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,520
I really don't know much about the
specific legal issues but a

80
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,320
it's that we had a direct and act on a

81
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,060
our lives in how much you have been the
most though and I

82
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,240
same and they waged a I'll we went
together for

83
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,600
probably six years around the area and I

84
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,960
that we are setting up the website and I

85
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,099
allowing people who download music for
free a has definitely a

86
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,050
given us many fans from all over the
place

87
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,470
a whether or not a arm allowed us to
sell our own records more

88
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,540
no story but pass to people

89
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,630
here in a music and having access to it
is is gonna

90
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,419
for now you're playing there tonight
right

91
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:06,740
we should be playing I believe you know
nine o'clock and I remove their

92
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,639
the alright the so I just want to start
with some some questions for the past

93
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,490
sorta kinda big picture and maybe later
we're getting a little more than kinda

94
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,570
not involved in the real stuff but are
basking Zeron

95
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,620
rethink do you think that is a good
thing generally and is the only good for

96
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,100
consumers is also good for us and who is
it

97
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,220
that poor you I think Napster is a

98
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,759
company is our would be almost
irrelevant

99
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,669
it orphans court case I'm in the sense
that we don't need anymore

100
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:41,120
i mean there are no other file-sharing
programs that work better

101
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,460
arm that will continue to evolve and get
better arm

102
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,180
and the are decentralized and not
subject to

103
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,590
legal action arm but yeah I think this
is amazing

104
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,280
transformative moment up for for world
culture and world music

105
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,300
arm it gives people an opportunity to
hear stuff they could never hear

106
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,380
anywhere else

107
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,680
arm with and he's never before imagined

108
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,850
arm and thats that only gonna be good
for

109
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,820
for the virtual are sharing which you
know from elementary school we should

110
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,430
have learned is very important thing

111
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,770
arm and a very valuable now hear
something keep in mind

112
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,190
arm a lot of his attention about Napster
as a company

113
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,919
and whether or not this whole thing is
going to be good for artists about

114
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:27,580
products are good for labels are bad for
labels

115
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,599
on ignores the fact that

116
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,639
this is a global phenomenon and arm

117
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,789
a CD bought in a legitimate store

118
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:41,349
in Bombay India costs about two hundred
rupees

119
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,720
on a cab driver in India makes about a
hundred rupees

120
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,590
a week arm there is no way that a cab
driver in India

121
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,430
can justify buying action leading a CD
collection

122
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,430
on there's no way that that cab driver
can ever hear Metallica

123
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,960
on but effect cab driver happens that
access to a computer

124
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,220
happen to have access to mp3 players um
and

125
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,870
electronic technology a lot more
affordable and India than the actual

126
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,759
items on then this cab driver has an
opportunity here music that he would

127
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,060
never hear anywhere else

128
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,860
on and so it's too early to tell

129
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,350
arm the extent a positive externalities
this

130
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,160
but they're going to be some serious
ones I guess we'll never know we hear

131
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,830
it's good for listeners but I'm

132
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,039
what about artists left already think is
a good for all artists why is it that we

133
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:29,449
have

134
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:32,579
be a ours against privacy bring up home
page at

135
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:36,360
I mean our sins against Arizona yeah

136
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,890
the I'm not going against president but
I'm I'm

137
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,710
plant full page ads in major newspapers
while we have people like Jackie

138
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,750
basically abdicating mp3 away it's
really weird several weeks I've been

139
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,470
working on putting this panel together

140
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:55,470
for for weeks and I contacted the RIAA
which

141
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,160
I've learned a lot about this company or
organization rather that

142
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,459
they are basically the sister and her
brother the MPAA

143
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,990
to same concept um and

144
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,320
as these guys can tell UN people that I
talk to at Yale and Harvard in

145
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,640
in terms of public discussion the RIAA

146
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,540
jumps out panels at the last moment

147
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,630
they would return my calls I started
down

148
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,290
getting really kinda vicious about it
and just calling every hour on the hour

149
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,480
I and lightly i since I work in radio
I've got friends

150
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,070
I'm they gave me the most direct phone
numbers at the High AA so

151
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,060
that mean I'm really happy I but

152
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,840
you know even up until Thursday they
just

153
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:48,190
really don't want to talk about this
because pardon me wonder they think

154
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,230
they're wrong if they know that they're
wrong

155
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,850
um in terms of the artists that

156
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,570
you'll notice that the artists that are
anti mp3

157
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,280
in a lot of ways are the ones they're
big enough to negotiate the contract

158
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:09,000
I have had major big bands come by the
radio station to do an on-air paying

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,910
you know they've got an album the
selling well not be talking to a woman

160
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,890
saying the other

161
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,770
get really great you know you guys kinda
came outta nowhere how's it going and

162
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,930
the guy looked one is good let me
straighten the face and set the time on

163
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:20,930
food stamps

164
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,290
any was serious any

165
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,520
actually had a copy this contract on him
and and and and showed it to me

166
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,960
and from just talking to these guys

167
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,930
you know even if they have a huge album
that sells

168
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,690
well most cases are not seein

169
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:46,140
hardly any of that money I'm i've seen.
let a record contract and having

170
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,140
10 percent huge

171
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,750
that is a huge huge deal most the time
comes down to four percent by percent

172
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,140
I'm so that's why you see the madonna is
a metallic is out there because they

173
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,760
have enough

174
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,530
pole with their and they've negotiated
new contracts for they get 25 percent

175
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,530
after they get forty percent

176
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,870
so of course there are more upset about
it from

177
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,500
but then you have guys that are unsigned
I

178
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,870
that are like whatever get the stuff out
there get me sign

179
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,430
great time and Jane to keep them

180
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,980
like hear from ya how earns a for is mp3
helping us they offer

181
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,040
food stamps and how it's a well a

182
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,160
as far as you don't really we haven't
actually made any money

183
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,740
any money that we get from it just goes
into like %uh flyering producing more

184
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,840
CDs I mean

185
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,510
we're not selling like 1000 records or
anything like that but

186
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,990
it is allowing us to generate fans I
mean people writer Mike

187
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,030
Singapore in Italy and South America

188
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,930
and something we can never do for
everyone on a label basically

189
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:55,690
the I'm okay we just words we're just
now joined by

190
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,270
Joe the operatives sat in here I'm liked
it

191
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,810
by saying anything go ahead but I guess
but it sorta I'm not sure why

192
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:07,040
quite where we are and I would be like a
baby on the way we caught a nap through

193
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,199
panel will start shortly and I got here

194
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,470
started very shortly I'm sorry that I'm
I'm

195
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,100
I guess we can just a ask you where you
stand on that really think it's a good

196
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,790
thing for us

197
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,699
in general they fed earlier today I have
not made up my mind

198
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:28,230
at all what I wanna get away from is
this black and white

199
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:35,050
vision that Napster is the big bad major
labels who rip off everyone make a and

200
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,770
from the artist Claire down to the Panda
summer their own employees

201
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:44,740
than from cases verses the little guy
who just want to check out the music for

202
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,500
free

203
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,230
there's a lot in between their two

204
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,420
arm I'm not against mp3 anymore me i
mean the

205
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,650
the majors are seem to be terrified
because they don't understand it but

206
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,990
didn't fit into their plans to introduce
yet another CD format the buyer

207
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,860
collection yet again

208
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,670
and this time it would go through thick
speakers instead of to remember quite

209
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,880
stereo a any

210
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,870
Jorge her to me it seems like mp3 would
be no more damaging to music

211
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,710
big and small than video rantoul was to
the film industry

212
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:29,480
and if you recall the MPAA who is suing
the organizer this convention in the

213
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,250
trial starts Monday

214
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,060
originally tried to stop the rental
videos

215
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,030
and thought it would be the end of the
film industry and instead it seems to

216
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:42,100
double their incomes so up

217
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,560
mp3 I don't feel too threatened by to me
it's a weird

218
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,170
that people wouldn't be interested in
hard goods that maybe I'm just stuck in

219
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:50,950
that mind

220
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:57,630
that because I'm a record collector and
have been since I was about 13 or 14

221
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,570
and tho but then when you get the
Napster it blurs

222
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,900
because it not just Metallica and doctor
dre /a

223
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,950
verses kids in dorm rooms

224
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,840
not a that not everybody who makes music
make that much money as Metallica or

225
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,440
doctor dre /a

226
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,710
the problem is there's many many other
people who'd like to be able to even

227
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:26,420
raise enough money to record another
album or another song let alone quit

228
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,730
their job that they hate as much as most
of us ate our jobs

229
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,140
and care because they can't make any
money on their music

230
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,640
and they're the ones including myself by
my dad

231
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,030
who may I'm not sure but may stand to
get hurt the worst

232
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,339
by this one friend of mine who are might
know

233
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,470
about seventh grade he was with such a
gifted guitarist he could play Hendrick

234
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,180
that aged

235
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,680
well and eventually involved in the
progra

236
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,800
rockin new AG stuff but now world fusion
music we've got interesting again but

237
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,950
anyway he's always done is

238
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:04,180
own paying strictly to his own vision

239
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,520
does not have any jackass at a major
telling him what to do

240
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,490
the price he pays is he scared shitless
he may be kicked out of the rent control

241
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,060
apartment he's had for almost 20 years

242
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,320
because he can't afford to pay the bills
anymore

243
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,170
so he's put out a website for his band
ancient future dot com

244
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,580
and says for every 900 here

245
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,100
that website get one person actually buy

246
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,970
with the D from him and he is quite
scared of Napster whereby you he might

247
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,710
even lose that extra one hit out nine
hundred I don't know I don't think it's

248
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,110
that

249
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,330
drastic but

250
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,740
may be part of the problem is that the
major labels are so damn greedy

251
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,670
that tho ni originally announced okay
okay we'll make some stuff available for

252
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,000
downloading

253
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,200
50 thongs that are vast catalog most of
which stinks

254
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,880
will be available to download an mp3 for
a generous

255
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,050
three dollars and forty ninth at the
fall

256
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,770
you multiply that by about 10 thong
Thunder thedi here fifteen what that

257
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,810
the virtually equivalent other thirty
five dollars to fifty dollars

258
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,680
CD when you could go by much cheaper at
the store they don't get

259
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:24,010
in other words and the debt everything
I've ever done is downloadable through

260
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:28,460
mp3 thumb up it's free the rest i think
is like a dollar 14

261
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,880
trackers something which is less than
the price of a 7-inch singles

262
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,750
like may be driving the price down will
help have also been told by Napster

263
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,270
enthusiasts the thumb

264
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,490
don't mind paying if they know they're
supporting them but you need the money

265
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,610
and the price is the little bit more
reasonable than three dollars and forty

266
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,630
ninth at the thought

267
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,740
but a lot of them don't tho

268
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,060
I double what the solution to that is
except to ask people to think about the

269
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,100
artists

270
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,310
and for the art is who are rolling and
Metallica money who just trying to

271
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,540
scrape by in my case I got in the park
so early I never finished college only

272
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,859
work for two months

273
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,320
and if I lose my livelihood I'm
unemployable

274
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,609
well I think it's yet to be seen whether

275
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,770
people do or don't want hard goods arm

276
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,859
and there's a lot out potential for

277
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,110
this whole technology being really good
for the sale of hard goods

278
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,520
on perhaps and different distribution
methods

279
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,139
perhaps are that point for different
price structure arm

280
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,730
if you if you look at the report that
%uh professor feder from

281
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,450
arm from Universal Pennsylvania Business
School submitted along with

282
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,990
the the a filings that Napster a

283
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,050
filed I guess with two weeks ago on he

284
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,909
very clearly argues that are a good
number

285
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,020
Napster users arm are using this

286
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,129
technology the best possible way for the
music industry

287
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,250
everybody knows the CD sales are up this
year versus last year

288
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,130
are the most frequent number we hear
about 8 percent when you compare the

289
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,090
first quarter fish

290
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,230
up this year where the first quarter
last year on so no one knows

291
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,440
where this illusionary losses coming
from

292
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,400
from and the the survey that freighter
dead showed that

293
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,440
arm most the people he talked to you use
Napster to decide

294
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,700
whether to buy a CD in which CDs to buy
some becoming

295
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,290
more educated consumer better consumers
so if you believe better

296
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,168
this can only be good for the sale of
hard goods and might even be really good

297
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:30,270
for major labels

298
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,540
arm it if they would stop panicking
about it now if you was in a chatty

299
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,550
truck he says this is going to be the
death made major labels and he's very

300
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,700
happy about that

301
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,800
on and he actually is trying to
represent the interests love

302
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,940
above emerging artists artis you can't
get on radio

303
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,950
artist who can't get on on Warner
Brothers

304
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,130
records on and if you follow his
business model

305
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,190
it might be good but chances are um if
Napster survives as a company

306
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,390
arm the results can be somewhere in
between these two things

307
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,030
some artist are gonna be able to figure
out a business model owada

308
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,290
to make a living with out actually
producing a piece of plastic

309
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,290
and then other artists are going to have
I a lot of success

310
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,879
putting out arm a document which people
so appreciated

311
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,340
still know that sergeant Pepper's a
document that sounds that document

312
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,389
arm and sticky fingers a document even
though the zipper doesn't go up and down

313
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,000
on the cover my CD anymore

314
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,280
arm but you know that's important thing
people appreciate it

315
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,530
are people value in they don't pay $18
bucks for it

316
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:33,190
arm n if if the price the city's would
come down to a reasonable point

317
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,510
a whole lotta what we call piracy would
probably

318
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:42,669
go away I'm but the mp3 movement is a
rational revolt a passionate fans

319
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:46,300
but it is entirely rational arm min
people aren't

320
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,480
reading up a a record store the broken
window

321
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,140
under actually becoming better consumers
I'm so

322
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,900
we'll see how it all breaks out in terms
of dollars on but music still gonna be

323
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,560
music

324
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,740
and people are still gonna be poured
some way the rich might not be as rich

325
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,630
as they are now

326
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,280
but hopefully the low end up the income
stream I get a little bit

327
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,050
better now banks have you got an article
coming out in

328
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:16,060
nation right that Rd and it's coming out
and Monday and online

329
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,620
online at a nation that I'm

330
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,140
anyway and that you write that LED
copyright system works best do you think

331
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,410
is copyright law relevant here is there
a role for and how the hell about the

332
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,290
artists and

333
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,760
its own what the what it it really I'm

334
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,140
it actually has a lot to do with the the
DCSS case

335
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,010
and a DVD case because on one of the
reasons

336
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:43,310
that the major labels are freaked about
the proliferation mp3 is a format

337
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:47,030
is that they can't put it under wraps
they can't

338
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:51,540
control access to this stop anymore and
controlling access is one things I've

339
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,040
been dreaming of for a long time

340
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,110
they hate the fact you can get you CD
they hate the fact you can borrow your

341
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,179
friend see

342
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:01,370
they hate the fact that you can check
out CDs from wipers

343
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,390
they hit the back and check out books
from libraries alright because these are

344
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,800
all losses to them

345
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,810
their dream is to have a metered system

346
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,610
up delivery a any cultural material that
would be great for them and

347
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,560
what when they panicked in around 1995
to 1997

348
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,639
screen to the clinton administration
scream to congress that

349
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,870
I digital digitisation up cultural
products

350
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,190
was gonna lead to massive piracy what
they're really saying is

351
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,990
this is an opportunity for us to encode
all this stuff

352
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,110
in in not in the electronic locks

353
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:38,330
arm and be able to deliver it in streams
and me to rate

354
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,480
are and if everything you paid for me
dirty everything was

355
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,429
part about jukebox that comes into your
home on then they not only control

356
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:50,730
every time you look at it and charge for
every time you look at something I read

357
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,340
something

358
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,879
on but they can also get rid of this
whole idea

359
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,370
lending or arm even

360
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,460
arm parity I mean they could actually
shut you down if you started causing

361
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,230
trouble

362
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,770
out to any other product at the
potential for cultural control

363
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,690
is overwhelming they don't see it that
way because you know they're not

364
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,929
thinking far had enough to think about
cultural control

365
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:16,290
up what they want is economic control
and has a very strong arguments for that

366
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:20,210
on so the beautiful thing about Napster
and a beautiful thing about the CSS

367
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,800
is it poking holes in their plan it
pokes holes in the planet up trouble

368
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,330
wrapping

369
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,240
every piece of culture in copyright law
and electronic locks

370
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,330
and contract law like quick rack wrapped
were you agree to a contract that you

371
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,720
haven't even read every time

372
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,730
quick access a particular site arm so

373
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,870
copyright law is I not neces-

374
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,419
the foundational copyright laws not
under attack by this technology

375
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:47,580
arm thoughts on the plan

376
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,110
a big media companies to be able to meet
her off and cultural expression is

377
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,570
definitely under attack

378
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:58,629
and I can ask her a question for jello I
when you found out that people were

379
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,350
were consuming your art without paying
for it

380
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:09,179
did upset you I am it's been going on
for so long in various forms I mean it

381
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,210
often can be a bigger problem trying to
police

382
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:16,660
that been letting it go I mean I was
actually a muse and I found out that

383
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,090
Kennedy's that was being

384
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,990
bootleg behind the iron I la make
curtain

385
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:27,210
in Indonesia and the way it was
identified as rock music was they put a

386
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:27,820
british

387
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:33,090
flag on the cover the cat that I know if
I was cool to crack the Islamic curtain

388
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,860
I thought it was funny

389
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,040
they also knew in the day the communist
regimes that were specially repressive

390
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,500
in czechoslovakia

391
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,980
former Soviet Union east germany there
was no other way to get my stuff but

392
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:51,080
tooth lot but on tapes under the secret
police is no

393
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,199
and my thing was are you serious he said
something to the effect

394
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,110
I'll there is no is that on this pager
not have my little notes I don't see it

395
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,030
here

396
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,700
or do I arm but the

397
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,780
such a good quote i really wanna hunt
for a second I

398
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:14,970
there and that is that I'll try to
paraphrase that I'm spacing here

399
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,530
the fine mondo 2000 tradition I guess um

400
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,040
and that that is the it is impossible
the control

401
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,530
the flow of non-physical good form they
can be so easily and

402
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,300
infinitely copy Napster even a bad

403
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,380
crack down on something else is going to
take its place

404
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,169
thong bored teenagers somewhere is gonna
find a way

405
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:41,669
to get around all the lot from the toll
booth

406
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:46,429
and though again I don't have an answer
for that

407
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:50,140
the thaw it like it but I get that the
pair when they were with my stuff is

408
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,960
weathered

409
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,510
I mean if it than organized mafia

410
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:59,760
bootleg I get pissed off especially when
chain stores stock it won't stop the

411
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,200
real

412
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,700
stuff that was a big problem in the
mid-eighties Raleigh

413
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:09,130
pirate pressing the Dead Kennedys come
helms coming through the mob oversee

414
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:14,020
and the stores and under selling our own
and we were when we were broken but I'm

415
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:18,290
like time at bat up that Mia like about
going to the wrong people as far as

416
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:23,120
people parading live tape and everything
else I didn't care I traded him to

417
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,380
in order to get all the home I have a
confession when I was in high school

418
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,590
I had all night that carry on front
apron France

419
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:33,919
thank you money a free music is always
been part economy I mean that and that's

420
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,340
and it's true that the good and why and
in the back hallway heart

421
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,070
I'll the way that a lot of emerging
artists and emerging generous

422
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,149
have built them their fan base on both

423
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,880
long before anybody who's signed a punk
band to a major label

424
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,660
on punk bands got their stuff out there
through tapes through friends

425
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,880
through communities and that's exactly
what happening on Napster

426
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,550
communities listeners are getting
together so you gotta hear this is

427
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,590
really cool

428
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,080
which is exactly what my friends did
with me with that Kennedy stuff

429
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,030
I really should but the office later but
abided by all those other

430
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:10,899
time well we want her exactly 100 but
right now I'm

431
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,260
that figures in debt because the other
former band members

432
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:19,030
dude me an attempt to steal the
copyright that my thong

433
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:23,180
which so far they succeeded at trial and
I have to appeal

434
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,920
because I would let him put holiday in
Cambodia levi's commercial

435
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,560
I mean unless opens the weird scary
question

436
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:36,100
what up some really noxious corporation
like cores or the gap

437
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,120
takes 10 my thongs put that on a
commercial

438
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,660
says well we downloaded it from Napster
so not only do we does not need your

439
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,680
permission we don't have to pay you

440
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,770
a for your thoughts and your voice is
being used to sell a product by

441
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,170
corporation that

442
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:56,510
folks with you so there example then
when copyright law can help out the

443
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,280
little guy and I kinda situation

444
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,500
everything yeah yeah okay and

445
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,570
see value you've made an outing to to
trading takes a friend like meeting once

446
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,740
a week and swapping mixtape think that
kinda thing

447
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,750
that's pretty much been out at the
National Defense free

448
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,640
relies on at least one part in it do you
really think it's the same kind of thing

449
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,280
because it seems to me that

450
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,990
I I think that's true to a certain
degree but and

451
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,250
is in control Parliament also yes some
punk band start out in like hip hop

452
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,430
stuff starts out with

453
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,710
people getting their tapes at giving
away for free but they're doing that by

454
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,470
choice right

455
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:31,930
is there a difference there natcher bomb
well

456
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:35,920
issue control works on two different
levels one is copyright law

457
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,150
does grant creators some limited control

458
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,280
under limited circumstances for limited
time arm

459
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,560
over the duplication up there of that
works and that's considered a good thing

460
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,190
it really is because it does provide an
incentive

461
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,310
to create and to publish and distribute
widely

462
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:56,110
on and so the middle how this whole
thing breaks down with mp3 the Napster

463
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:56,920
and Gnutella

464
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,360
there has to be some sort of system that
retains thats

465
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,610
arm that incentive to create I

466
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,240
and it's hard to say how that system
going to work

467
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,490
I'll but a lot up this argument over
control is based on a really

468
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,850
from inappropriate Romanus romantic
attachment

469
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,820
to to the to the the active creativity
in a sense that

470
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,629
a up saying on I you know

471
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,990
a third they're playing with my soul

472
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,110
or they're playing with the product of
my soul and there should be a law to

473
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,060
restrict that

474
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,490
and I we actually don't want to
restricted by copyright system

475
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,740
arm that prevents people from I'll

476
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,440
using and sharing and and rewriting and
commenting on calling from

477
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,880
previously produce material I'm cuz that
actually is where cultural creativity

478
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,180
comes from

479
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,690
think that your money them in jello and
James and Keith maybe I can answer this

480
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,520
on

481
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,320
do you feel that way that it's use a
course XY or something

482
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,580
uses Internet is didn't feel like I have
a moral

483
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,600
I'm transgression against you visit

484
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,140
I think all rape would be a better word

485
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,770
would you date picker and I for term yet
quiet now

486
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,950
buying this lawsuit from people I
thought were my friends

487
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,630
a were you saying before that you think
it's a good thing that

488
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,150
artists don't have complete control over
their distribution because im

489
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,520
will might motivate them to create more
well

490
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,550
is that we said cutlery loss was to be a
balance arm

491
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,740
and you have to take into account the
yet to give artist just enough

492
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,220
incentive to produce a while to
distribute that works but you don't want

493
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,800
to completely close system

494
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,180
because every artist builds on the work
a previous artist now that doesn't

495
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,250
include course

496
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,280
if callers were to take jello songs I

497
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,290
and and even tweet them a little bit
that would be a purely commercial act

498
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:57,420
arm and I the way the copyright law
works is jealous that some claim to that

499
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,610
arm depending on the contract he signed
with back in the day and all that kind

500
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,190
of stuff

501
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,309
are but so it's not the answers not
simple either side

502
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:08,500
are but we have to have a balanced
coverage system that has holes in it

503
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,490
that lets are a kid in his garage are
sample

504
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:15,490
some classic material and put it out in
a new way

505
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:19,280
on and also lets people make fun of
previous material

506
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,680
arm and lets people use cultural
material is copyrighted in a classroom

507
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,500
of a research or in news media to be
able to comment on it

508
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,660
I'm and all those things are under
threat right now but I don't understand

509
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,960
how that's more you mean it's motivation

510
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,390
the young black male like people on a
that very well very

511
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:40,520
I'm glad you made it when she signed to
a major label they can by

512
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,010
use what rights they have to your music
against you to create more

513
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,629
ona I i'm not think that without some
church usher

514
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:51,040
I i mean the the basis for the very
existence the cover system is to

515
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,110
is to give offer some sort of financial
award to creators right but

516
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,480
arm but that's not a complete level
control

517
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,150
over ever use that the music in all
cases there there these very specific

518
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,750
holes poked in the system

519
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:07,410
up by Congress by users by courts a over
the

520
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,980
the last two centuries that sorta allow
for certain level the freedom

521
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,860
and that's what we call we talk about
their use that we're talking about on

522
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,190
but

523
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,730
core using a commercially produce on in
a commercial is not fair use it actually

524
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,580
I an overtly commercial act and
therefore requires permission

525
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,110
I would also add to that that some
corporation

526
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:30,360
after being denied permission by the
artist put a bette Midler song on a

527
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,260
commercial with somebody who had a dead
ringer for her voice

528
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:40,890
and Bette Midler suit them and one

529
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,840
lesley Anne schism good from the ethics

530
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,950
standpoint have Napster and downloading
stuff

531
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,480
um I read an article in a audio
production magazine

532
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,110
about there's all these companies that
develop add-on

533
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:01,130
software for Pro Tools basically what
most radio stations

534
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:05,059
stations use for production and there's
all the small companies that write these

535
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:06,330
add-ons and

536
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:10,929
people use them every day but what
happens is two or three people and the

537
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,040
audio production community radio
stations and

538
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,530
production houses by it and then they
swap it

539
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:21,260
online and there's been several cases
where

540
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,410
these companies end up going out of
business because

541
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,750
their stop this you know basically
pirated

542
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:34,920
and people the use those add ons love
them they use that saw for every day

543
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,929
but they're not supporting the stuff
that they love and it's

544
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:43,450
and in it kinda sucks because there's
really cool creative people out there

545
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,150
creating stop

546
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,250
any I kinda feel like if you enjoyed

547
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,990
something whether it's gels music

548
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,690
or written add-on Pisa software or
whatever you should put your money where

549
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:56,970
your mouth is

550
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,870
and support that person financially says
unethical

551
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:04,390
assertion right what you think what you
think the law can do to to enforce that

552
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,510
if anything

553
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,850
well I mean I don't at your the longer
do you know

554
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:14,650
and after I'm just a hippie I'm

555
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,660
I think you try to enforce it then
you're gonna get into some pretty

556
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,929
draconian

557
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:23,220
stuff a and every time you

558
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,750
every time you come up with okay what
they would think we shut down after

559
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,480
tomorrow

560
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,500
at to relevant there there are

561
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,580
masters under different names on the way
or already out there

562
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,700
with the new hello from portraying

563
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,309
what I i think is also like some kinda
strange better spread and

564
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:45,490
Europe a minute

565
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,510
coming up so shamelessly play to the
crowd if

566
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:52,710
if everybody used open source software
free software and

567
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,170
almost all cases are we wouldn't have
this problem but that's not gonna happen

568
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,600
I i mean we needed

569
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,300
there will be always commercially
produce offering some it can be great

570
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:06,470
are summer's gone especially in
specialized industries

571
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,790
be

572
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,560
while 00 I we were talking about supper
Paris in this case

573
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,918
right I'm using parities what this is
all things about thats

574
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,989
that's different arm but not nonetheless
arm

575
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:22,310
and that's why it was just that I'm
gonna start like router

576
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,449
for the second loss I don't get enough
to my business questions to applaud me

577
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:30,109
arm but a I

578
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:34,250
a

579
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,760
however I'm a there there're

580
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,910
to you proposal I mean really two
solutions to the idea of software piracy

581
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:45,659
one is I encrypt it into such a degree
that its

582
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,699
difficult to get around arm the

583
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,179
the electronic locks but everyone is
wrote room knows that won't last very

584
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:53,020
long it just

585
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,770
it just rate you know it's like an arms
race and nobody gets

586
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:00,680
get paid at the and arm and then the
other is

587
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,270
arm is really be at the mall answer and
that is some have

588
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:07,759
a community ethic about software and
about piracy

589
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,520
and probably about music as well a man
have a healthy

590
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,180
I attitude toward the toward this as a
commercial system

591
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,960
now here's the the thank me every time
um a company like Microsoft or company

592
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,030
like time warner

593
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:24,900
arm ratchets up the arms race tries to
take

594
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,990
control over big chunk of the culture or
tries to take

595
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,840
control over their product to the degree
that their

596
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,820
you're forcing you to use a particular
system for a particular use you have no

597
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,300
choice

598
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,520
you have to play a Sony DVD on a sony
dvd player

599
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,350
on that makes people angry and they feel
like it okay

600
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,839
to arm trump the system ruin the system
fight the system

601
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,860
matter who gets hurt I'm and thats a
shame

602
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:54,870
arm but so the only way that people are
gonna stop trying to

603
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,299
a throw the whole system at a black on
is it

604
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,460
all these companies were able to lower
their prices to the point where we all

605
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,810
appreciate what we were getting

606
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:06,799
for the dollar arm that's not an easy
answer I mean it is something that's

607
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,670
going to have to sort a

608
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:12,100
I grow up by through communities and
that that's how ethics works on

609
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,230
it people talk to each other about
what's right and what's wrong on

610
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,430
but it's always important to remember
that if you introduce law

611
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:22,120
to enforce affects your often asking for
more problems than your solving

612
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:27,049
be to be a little under I have an hour
left at like to open up for

613
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:34,050
questions from the audience I'm couple
good

614
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,710
be are are on now I a comment and then a
question

615
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,960
um one think that's really great about
the internet is that you can have

616
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,090
the dysentery mediate the the whole
process the retail chain meaning that

617
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:51,040
you take out the middleman I suddenly
instead of having

618
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,570
the artist and the the listener having a
few couple

619
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,680
you know maybe distributor and
publishing company in the Middle he

620
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,660
suddenly get where the middle to and you
can go directly from one to the other

621
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,830
my question is um

622
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:07,130
if you couldn't control

623
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:10,490
the copying process is mainly for for
jello and James here

624
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:14,270
if you couldn't control people copying
your music I

625
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:18,640
this cap to affect making money and
music in one is the CD sales are the

626
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,540
music sales and the other is the
performance

627
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,040
fails could you do you think you could
survive just on the

628
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,370
on the the performances I mean talking
about in the Middle Ages we had

629
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,220
wondering minstrel going around

630
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,350
we take and they were here poor remember
the first right people to be executed

631
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,490
when the game got boring

632
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:42,590
a there's a lot of wandering minstrels

633
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:47,520
out there who would like to be able to
like get their teeth fixed at the

634
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,420
dentist

635
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,710
or have a place to live that isn't like
a toll

636
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:57,370
fucking hole and stuff and don't wanna
and the rest of us don't especially

637
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,600
who who are right on the press the first
the falling into that

638
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,890
don't wanna fall into that because
people rich enough to be able to burn

639
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,359
their own CDs in their dorm room

640
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,720
thumb their nose at the idea of paying
the for the music paying the musicians

641
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,840
who make them happy

642
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,880
them know what wandering minstrels are
not the answer but an idea just came to

643
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,480
me

644
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,120
is there is already movements to by you
know abuse the workers in third world

645
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,450
sweatshops for both clothing and other
goods

646
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:30,280
people like global exchange have stores
that fell

647
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,920
only Fairtrade merchandise

648
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,420
and so maybe one playing to do

649
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,040
would be for the artist per per Miami
really underground one

650
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,520
to form some kind of reunion or
distributor

651
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,220
whereby if you get this from us that a
reasonable price

652
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,730
you know the artist is getting paid and
you know that

653
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:57,770
you know succubi major labels and
management and law offices are not

654
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,270
getting any p for the pie

655
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:04,640
because the the free distribution and
copying is unstoppable

656
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,220
that's never gonna stop at this point I
don't know how

657
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,610
though the only thing the artist can do
just say hey you like iced up please

658
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:16,420
give us a little human respect at the
same time

659
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,920
all thought that a site 10 July get
nobody mentioned yet

660
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,470
speaking of the major label greed Sony
and crew just lost an anti-trust action

661
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,710
by the Federal Trade Commission

662
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:33,200
who ruled that their CDs were priced
five dollars higher than they ought to

663
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,920
be

664
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,510
in other words if they priced them at
the same price that I sell mine for it

665
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:42,400
never would have happened to them

666
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,960
that okay what i won to say if all to
make sure the tree in a statement and a

667
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,040
question

668
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,610
I think a.m. over the the last two years

669
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,930
I am Leonia talk about the thing a

670
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,540
Hall I could get my money

671
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,700
yeah but isn't it more than only
thinking about the

672
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,910
how I got my money in the old way I
think we have a

673
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,810
to molest think about the idea how to
get

674
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:12,660
good generally so the question as

675
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,850
Hall did to the distributed

676
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:19,089
a all about him um

677
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:22,370
what's the question of money in the
future that the way we should

678
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:26,549
a stop to talk about in my hand and my
makes no sense for me to thing

679
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,670
on all we talk about musicians know we
talk about some up with no we talk about

680
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,420
some software engineers

681
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,380
no question s we all Inouye work

682
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,170
not only on the web on the net we look
more than that

683
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:44,340
and death some some people ok on told
them that

684
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:50,450
why can be all stand up and say hey come
on w3c of some terrible writer

685
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,980
I work for you up on thumb box II

686
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,120
a program some script I have to get
money from you

687
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,310
and then we can talk about but I do with
10 percent of his money

688
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:07,490
I can give it then to that net that can
give it back to

689
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:12,230
1 percent for the militia and so on so
there's more than only a question of

690
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:15,830
how to get real money or credit card
money

691
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:18,950
it's a question of how

692
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:23,160
I think this abuse in all who in the
future

693
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,830
and that's not only questions out of the
side of musicians all

694
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:29,950
artist generates a the thing everyone
had to

695
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:33,140
think about because the net as

696
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,330
its it's like it relaxed feel like a
machine

697
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:40,390
and we were up for this machine it seems
to be very is stranger crazy to think

698
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,520
about this

699
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,140
but in a way at is we are the employer

700
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:49,029
open that so I am

701
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:52,100
50/50 should be well for kind of Big
Brother thing

702
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,550
control but did you muck systems which a

703
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:00,020
you walk around on the window and there
yet a time you on your t-shirt

704
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,700
and the window popped up and said all
come on you had a Walkman in your hand

705
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,340
and you listen to a track

706
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:09,530
but you weren't hadn't reckoned record
for this all all the next day a GPS

707
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,380
system good controlling me

708
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:17,210
all my my I get and I scanner because I
look too much on a picture our offer

709
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,940
terribly up I a t-shirt or whatever have
you have to think more

710
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,740
yet to use your pension deal with what
what what what could happen

711
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:28,690
if you say okay no interest I'll never
know down there down upon a bit so

712
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:29,130
you're

713
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,660
your basic question was why are we cut
is the kind of false distinction between

714
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,339
music

715
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:38,270
and other kinds O intellectual works is
that kinda what you're getting at

716
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:42,100
yet that about the future money that
they talk about the future

717
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,470
yeah thing I think up the ECA economic
redistribution generating

718
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:51,480
so in the meantime against

719
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,130
okay I'm you pick your people yet it
felt very socialistic but my own filler

720
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:00,040
another P professor told me a
capitalistic

721
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,200
in a spiral I think way that the thing
is I think way

722
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,820
the perfect speculate on real quick to
than online expression by the capital

723
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,920
and I think that that

724
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,660
the comparison between like coaters and
musicians is tough because

725
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,819
I think that minutes there's a lot of
parallels but

726
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,270
on cutters can give back to the net help
build the net and you know make it a

727
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,750
better machine but

728
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:23,030
I don't musicians and music is a much
more purely aesthetic code

729
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:27,260
is is that it also is functional and so
I think it's that tough analogy to make

730
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,460
but anyway next question

731
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:36,460
a swell try to make this is our quick as
I can but

732
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:41,710
arm a like it has a line behind me but

733
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:46,830
anyways are I'm not allowed to say too
much but sent I talk to my house and

734
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:51,130
tall a company check a day it gave me
permission it's more information out but

735
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:55,850
I'm currently beta testing you know a
new sort of music distribution like

736
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:56,880
Napster

737
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,330
the code names called artfully but they
plan it Cain shit official name sometime

738
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:02,810
down the road but

739
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:06,770
anyway so this is like it unlike a
Napster client is still allows you know

740
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:10,310
person the person the communication up
mp3 files

741
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:13,570
I'm they're still you got all mp3 or not

742
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:17,510
so St Elmira like call sodomy protected

743
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:21,900
right time and anyways I'll

744
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,410
the system well basically every time a
files changed

745
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:29,080
will display a couple a banner ads we
don't know what's coming 15 yr

746
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,270
whatever the official it but it just
kinda I'm getting rough layout but

747
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,880
ill display banner ads the advertiser
pays for those abs

748
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,460
percent goes to partly company and then
the rest let me know goes to the artist

749
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,210
um unsigned artists as well he'll sign
record companies condemns

750
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:49,540
met registry into the database

751
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:53,490
but anyway some other terminals with
this so system that's been brought up

752
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:58,500
and why it's probably going to be too
late for a while coming out

753
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,730
and I guess I can direct that question
to

754
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:05,150
too many artists on the panel how would
you feel jello and indicate about

755
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:08,370
having you know that meant getting paid
and you know you're going to get paid

756
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,960

a AZ I i can claim such more

772
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:07,129

773
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:11,200
per day the artist is I cut a certain
amount of money

774
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,110
based on the %uh place so but still his
laptop based on some sort of a

775
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:19,580
sponsorship program where somebody's
like sponsoring like

776

website min

777
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:26,470
why

778
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:29,580
gathered specific question when is move
on to the line

779
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,740
okay on it style online I have
questioned of

780
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,920
okay well let me get her one quick
question

781
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,580
yeah well the thing with this music
software is it's also going to have on

782
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,590
my question yeah

783
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:46,420
it's gonna be a have this John Rhys
system in their work gets down the more

784
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,210
detail but

785
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:50,260
a thing as as what another thing to
worry about us

786
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,460
what do you think the idea that pretty
soon there's not going to be any like

787
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,910
major top bands name or any other pretty
so you know everybody's gonna other

788
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,549
customize music collection and you know
it's like okay

789
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:03,930
one band has like 200 advanced gather
around the world where you getting this

790
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,220
idea from

791
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,680
where we watchin TV advert when you put
your channel felt like that but there's

792
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,040
back in the big bands that by everybody
listens to and then Mike

793
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,029
a small group of people that has more
the first case there's always going to

794
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:20,360
be pop culture and and you're never
going to get rid of the Britney Spears

795
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,410
and the hell I I we know we know that
for a fact but but you're saying that

796
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,170
like being out big time you're always at
LA

797
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:31,150
millions of albums if we get back to
wandering minstrels for a minute I think

798
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,580
you're not gonna see left the

799
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,710
that you may theme or because the

800
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:40,550
the the culture corporations figure well
we can't make any money on albums

801
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:41,520
anymore

802
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,870
so we're only gonna push makeup pop
stars

803
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:48,620
and in order then what people are
conditioned to desperately wanna see

804
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:53,140
these make a pop stars in order to make
back the money we would normally make up

805
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:57,190
the days after all major labels now own
concert venues

806
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:02,440
to universal concert is part of the same
universal they don't then CA editors go

807
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,180
well because of that we decided to raise
ticket prices to a hundred bucks

808
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:12,020
and only the hundred people they all the
bad people willing to fuck up at only

809
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:12,770
about 100 bucks

810
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:16,610
the theory are the only ones anybody's
going to be able to see

811
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:21,430
that is the the nariño I would not want
a theory on top of that they might

812
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:24,460
also cut the lead we've got for youth

813
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:28,020
good to give a shit about their music or
we've got somebody pretty

814
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:32,350
all we can do 100 dollar cut third and
market dolphin action figures

815
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:36,160
which cannot be downloaded through
Napster let's go with that

816
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,950
doll come on Britney here we go get all
the money that either

817
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:45,310
next question the next Hicks idly I make
your questions in the form of a question

818
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:49,500
alright yeah up to a clever at

819
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,400
streaming across her I

820
00:48:53,400 --> 00:49:00,400
continuing I continuing with the banner
ads I issue

821
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:06,030
I go ahead please better at will call
you know more pretty soon after dawn

822
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:08,110
Marty my partner in crime and I get
through

823
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:12,600
I he actually has a a proxy at the DP
.org

824
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,180
I a way to block all double click ads
and

825
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:19,240
on krajina write a book like 101 ways to
find the owner

826
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,150
and a question for a question is some I
think that people still buy it like what

827
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,450
does the hard goods

828
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:28,010
and Mike with a red hat box that's free
software and bookable by

829
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:31,240
do you think that people's will

830
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,850
'em drop-off in growth mp3 become the
definitive

831
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:38,370
a I'll you non making me

832
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:42,140
magnetic media format not visible why I
can't speak for everybody but

833
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:46,330
I don't think on a bus stop by and
cities for a long time I really like 'em

834
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,569
on and I've already invested several
hundred dollars and

835
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:53,500
the machines the plane I only have one
machine plays mp3

836
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,700
arm and it weighs eight-and-a-half
pounds I can take you to the Gen

837
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,780
I hope you like dropping a few hundred
bucks for another machine the place them

838
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:03,360
on and i also do think that that liner
notes a valuable

839
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,750
I think cover art valuable arm and I
think

840
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,800
an album actually works together if

841
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,210
it started as an album now I never
listen to

842
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,900
on insane Kalmar the way through but we
wanna bet it's not actually an album I

843
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,880
do wanna bet its

844
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,500
two or three a singles and a bunch of
filler

845
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:25,520
arm on the other hand you know
Springsteen's Nebraska is an album

846
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,140
and if it came out today arm it would
only be valuable as an album

847
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,290
we reach new york is now much
effortlessly from beginning to end

848
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:37,370
on and you can't really pick a single
out a bit every some cops to itself so

849
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:41,720
I mean to live in in some sort of all
our I made up for that just cleared

850
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,940
music fan speaking

851
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:46,510
every other kid in America may have a
completely different view of albums

852
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:50,770
but albums became the that choice for
distributing

853
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:54,970
music be out singles in not the way to
succeed early seventies

854
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:58,740
because people really like the idea such
a paper Quadrophenia

855
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:03,290
I mean that really move people arm so I
mean I don't think it's gonna go away

856
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,320
for a while

857
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,770
although thank you when not today 20

858
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:11,830
twelve-year-old become tomorrow's
20-year-old comfy nor even

859
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:16,130
ever to buy a CD player let alone a
turntable that

860
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:20,630
could change I'm yeah this is in
response to what Joe

861
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:24,690
same for about strand doesn't have a job
and he just

862
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,740
works on his music is a really talented
musician

863
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:32,520
and we haven't address the independent
scene so much but I'll

864
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,520
I've been in and out a pop-rock band and
just all kinds music for years

865
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,790
and you should know that if your gonna
do that not have a job you can be living

866
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:42,820
off food stamps no matter what

867
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,010
but as in terms of Napster spreading I'm

868
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:50,280
the music throughout the US are you
gonna make your money

869
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,810
you gonna have to go on for just putting
up a website and just trying to sell you

870
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:54,180
see

871
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,230
CD again so many hats or whatever I

872
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:01,060
you're gonna have to life-giving well
this is just the response I don't have

873
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,910
that almost finished up for

874
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:06,240
but up yet you're going to have to go
out on tour

875
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,380
a supposedly naps are probably get your
CD hyped up if you have one out

876
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,540
and there's no way I'm just gonna make
it just by not having a job

877
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,950
you can be really out in that really sad
but

878
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:21,950
you just not gonna make it just our you
should know because you know

879
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:26,150
you have your own label about pancho pop
rock band rose know and everybody on

880
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:30,250
that label would dearly like to quit
their fuckin shit chop

881
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:34,380
and play do what they really love whole
time

882
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:38,150
sure what up some those bands don't
really tore how many of them

883
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:42,460
ours do how many CDs that up buzz kill
cell

884
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,100
um not as much as I wish IIIi

885
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,170
thanks very much here's why i'm I guess
at some that are

886
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:53,340
yeah when the biggest thrills as a
musician is performing

887
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:56,470
performing live so i cant you really
just can't %ah

888
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:59,740
sit at home and not try to sell your
music over the Internet or

889
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:04,140
through your mailbox and really be
satisfied as a musician

890
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,529
I think there's another issue 2 is it
are you creating art with music or

891
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:08,170
whatever

892
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:13,300
to make bank are are you trying to
express yourself

893
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:17,380
and maybe introduce a new concept other
people

894
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:20,900
and make people think about things I
think punk rock and a lot of activist

895
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,830
music

896
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:25,730
um it may not just be about the docket
it's about

897
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:30,520
social change sky

898
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:35,570
the next question um I really like I'm
what does heard about

899
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:38,960
I'm absurd have a union or a

900
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,780
million online independent label that
every musician that was interested could

901
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,170
be a part of that

902
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:48,360
I'm unit so that the the consumer are
the listener

903
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,770
would R&B buying it for for a reason

904
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:56,120
and I was also I was thinking about time
we talked a lot about what might happen

905
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:59,150
are a little bit about what might happen
two major labels but what would happen

906
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:00,040
to independent

907
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:04,410
labels a if the Napster type thing it
was really big

908
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:07,440
and if we didn't have some kinda union
or

909
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,720
other kind of cooperative met so I just
I was instead of just

910
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:16,860
have people talk about that again we
might not be able to afford to pay our

911
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,410
bill

912
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:22,160
in the halfcourt do you need labels for
well I don't want to have to do every

913
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,569
got damn phone call to every radio
station every press person in every

914
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:28,700
letter that comes then myself

915
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:34,580
I don't have time I K create anything
anymore by do so I MUST hire somebody

916
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,470
else to help me with that

917
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:40,720
and at this point the label has nothing
at all to repair decal has five people

918
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,510
working there doing various things

919
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:48,170
and the reason other people come to
wanting us to put out their stuff

920
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:52,600
is that tho those five people can help
get their stuff out there

921
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:58,770
too far more than that then people who
would find it random browsing on the web

922
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:03,720
so the 182 or somebody might have heard
above and actually show up to ring that

923
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,140
do a damn bit a good if nobody goes to
see you play

924
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:11,710
I think they've also bull the it'll be
harder to have an independent label if

925
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:12,820
announced that thing is

926
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,850
never it'll be different it'll be like
some independent labels are gonna be

927
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:16,600
able to

928
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,680
grass the stuff really well and run with
it Tom

929
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,800
I know a well my that supply I don't
know I don't run away but I think what

930
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,090
money the Broncos any different cuz
label on is probably going to do really

931
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:28,670
well

932
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:31,830
because it has such a strong are fan
base

933
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:35,000
I people who are deeply loyal to her and

934
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,250
and the bands that are with her on and
they don't have a website yet

935
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:43,900
and have there something like twelve or
fourteen span based web sites for

936
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,980
and they all point she they'll give the
address up where to get the season where

937
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,120
to get the t-shirts

938
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,200
arm and you can get her stuff on mp3 all
over the place

939
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,800
but people are still buying her CDs
whether it's in the back up concert hall

940
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,580
or it's out there they're sending her a
check are and

941
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:03,480
if you can work that out i mean overhead
might be lower might be higher you don't

942
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:03,730
know

943
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:07,790
been the web changes all those questions
on on the other hand there's there's a

944
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:11,350
II truck is repetition that com is an
independent label

945
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:14,990
arm and itself at space and that I would
generate revenue

946
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:19,720
on it also are likes to I think the
church dollar song I am and what I want

947
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,460
I'm pretty sure HR two dollars on

948
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:26,230
for download and and thats truck do you
think it really shows you what labels

949
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:26,920
worth

950
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,670
arm away ball is a gatekeeper it's
making an editorial decision

951
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:35,600
for you and saves you time if you wanna
hear on artist

952
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,150
that that chuck dee dee eggs arm and you
don't want to have to wade through

953
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:44,040
300 mp3 downloads for $299 again be crap

954
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,070
I'm interested in a calm and his people
have a

955
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:52,140
sorry given it a stamp of approval and
you like everything else you've heard

956
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:52,670
their

957
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:55,820
the gatekeeper function works and that
can save everyone a lot of time and

958
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:56,280
money

959
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,320
and maybe distribute a little money
within that economy as well so that

960
00:56:59,320 --> 00:56:59,860
these

961
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:03,680
folks who can't get on major labels and
certainly can't get on radio

962
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,150
can make a little cash I in addition
want to get touring

963
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:12,730
get another question arm I well maybe a
little more about the

964
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:17,810
possibility that happen Union I'm I
wanted to just hear what other people

965
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:21,640
are thinking about back kinda pasady

966
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,589
I know that s maybe that's 12 to think
about afterwards I guess out of the top

967
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:26,320
of my head

968
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,960
that came to your Yahoo 11 all

969
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:34,360
though make me run it I already got to
my you ok

970
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:38,470
what to do anything about us to move on
to the next time question please

971
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:41,550
I'm I have a at two questions one based
on

972
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:45,010
the response to that last question the
first question is

973
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:48,800
that everybody I says all these
wonderful things in the beginning about

974
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,640
how Napster is going to be used to get
you know people in India access to

975
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,020
Metallica or people in this country
access to independent songs that they

976
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:57,910
don't say

977
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:01,960
but all the software from what I see is
you search for so long

978
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,800
and in my experience that only only use
Napster once

979
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,910
and I did a search for Devo internet one
copy with it

980
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:13,210
I did a search for bin will they might
be Giants and turned up nothing

981
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:18,530
and found a million copies love whatever
Britney Spears in Inglewood

982
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:22,360
why I tell you what and I'm just sayin
that

983
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:26,400
people are searching for what they want
so is added

984
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,440
really gonna be that you just had the
most popular music on there

985
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,340
in a way but for stopping what they
might be giant city music dot com

986
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:37,520
II I black inferno me that has set and
they

987
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,890
they might be dances totally down with
any sort of new business model the deals

988
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:43,379
electro music distribution

989
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:46,480
because they they hated that they got
the short end the stuff for years from a

990
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,170
joyful

991
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:51,240
however are now but that's really the
question and the solution to that the

992
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,570
one the only way that

993
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:56,650
that emerging bands marginal bands are
going to actually win this game

994
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:59,900
is if communities of listeners operate
the way they should know where they

995
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,240
always have I think they well

996
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,460
on one of the great things about Napster
is I you can talk to other people

997
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:09,220
who share your musical tastes are and
you can do to Gnutella to order that

998
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:13,060
their massive traffic can you tell is
really sort of that poor right now

999
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:17,610
arm is in a gene Hart army I thought
that she was supposed to be hard

1000
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:21,990
and maybe this happen pressures newshour
it's like new resin

1001
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:25,200
PG&E roomies II thats

1002
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,040
yes it's like me it's like they're
writing about water so anyway

1003
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,290
by animal fragmentary but the arm

1004
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:35,750
hit communities that listeners are
allowed to

1005
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:39,440
I give each other taps I tell people
what's hot what's good

1006
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,880
which is how much music as always work
arm then

1007
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,020
then yes you can find stuff not gonna be
able to find evidence you like bill

1008
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,560
fight back catalog stuff that well

1009
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:51,310
I'm actually surprised that you know
someone else hasn't decided some major

1010
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:55,029
develop and as a but every device on on
there maybe they are there somewhere but

1011
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,160
you just get lucky

1012
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,330
I think this is also a reaction to to
what happened the radio

1013
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:03,400
um radio has changed dramatically

1014
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,340
two or three companies own every fucking
radio station and that's no lie

1015
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:11,340
there's companies that own 8 100 radio
stations

1016
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:16,830
their I is one guy to decide all the
music for k-rock New York k-rock LA

1017
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:20,400
and live 105 in San Francisco out with
the computer

1018
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,980
and its and I'll and in a lot of cases
some

1019
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:27,350
it a it is a the software

1020
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:31,240
is called selector I and

1021
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:35,280
and it's getting to the point now where
actually have a colleague that works in

1022
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,200
Denver

1023
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,640
and they have a a little farmer DJ's
there the DJ's

1024
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:43,620
read the computer they say there's a
Metallica song in a van Halen sign they

1025
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,560
go it alone without a doubt Van Halen

1026
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:50,380
and that voice file shipped to radio
stations nationwide and placed in

1027
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:54,030
between those songs and those songs are
displayed of a server

1028
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:57,830
at radio stations in those markets
that's what happened a radio and I think

1029
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:01,210
that's that's why Napster and the
Internet music community is a reaction

1030
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:02,310
to that because

1031
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:06,710
the radio really really sucks had

1032
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:10,440
in

1033
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,529
don't get another crack yeah

1034
01:01:13,529 --> 01:01:16,750
maybe last photograph playing music
during the techno file

1035
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:21,240
as well they should you know I'm jealous
said a before about the labels that it

1036
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:21,700
was

1037
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:25,589
the artist finding something to work for
them but because they couldn't do all

1038
01:01:25,589 --> 01:01:26,288
the work

1039
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:29,890
and is not part the problem that the is
in the current system now that the

1040
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:30,970
artists are working

1041
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:34,440
the labels on working for the artist the
artist working for the labels in most

1042
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:34,980
cases

1043
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:38,680
major label yes independent label

1044
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:44,170
hopefully not all that does not count
the independent labels who are wanna be

1045
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,359
major labels

1046
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:49,359
they were shall remain nameless below

1047
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:54,230
a I was wondering if you think a stuff
like the Napster is gonna cause more

1048
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:57,809
horizontal and vertical consolidation
integration in the industry for

1049
01:01:57,809 --> 01:02:02,019
perfect I'll stop where you're talking
about like a company owning not only

1050
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:06,260
a Becker companies but also doing like
the concert and stuff like that

1051
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:09,470
is you know sup like the Napster going
to change that

1052
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:13,059
or its gonna make it worse at go ahead
I'm

1053
01:02:13,059 --> 01:02:17,869
Gophers I have no idea I like anybody
that's what's going to happen to that

1054
01:02:17,869 --> 01:02:21,240
with that but another thought that
occurred to me up here as

1055
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:25,390
imagine if Metallica and Napster go to
trial

1056
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:29,690
and the ruling is that not only Napster
can do what they're doing but anyone

1057
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:30,599
else can

1058
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:34,079
to so immediately Microsoft moves then

1059
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:37,599
Sony moves then Oracle moves there and
and

1060
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:40,900
weep Napster clear out the door the site

1061
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,549
finally will be just like the fifties we
don't have to pay

1062
01:02:44,549 --> 01:02:48,059
anybody anymore that I would hate to see

1063
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:51,789
competition question also because that's
a real wealth

1064
01:02:51,789 --> 01:02:56,670
doing and one other wanna claims in a
countersuit by up to get lawyerly per

1065
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:57,710
second but it's good news

1066
01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:00,759
I'm and want to claim the countersuit by

1067
01:03:00,759 --> 01:03:03,930
natural lawyers against the RIAA is that

1068
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:07,609
can obscure claim call abusive copyright
know basically saying that the

1069
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:10,880
RIAA in the labels that belong to it I'm
are

1070
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,920
base for making this suit in bad faith
in order to keep out

1071
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,339
this format that they see the threat so
that can address that

1072
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:20,640
that question hello I was her

1073
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,730
overall wondering can you stop it I mean

1074
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:29,029
can anyone they try the government right
they went right to stop technology

1075
01:03:29,029 --> 01:03:32,910
but I think the problem is that they
don't realize that you can stop

1076
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:33,519
something

1077
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:37,170
because its never it's always changing

1078
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:41,380
I mean you have Napster and Gnutella you
have cue that Mac you have all the

1079
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:44,880
things I mean you have mp3 she has asst
up movies

1080
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,920
I mean shut down mp3 it is going to be
something else

1081
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,859
I mean and you see Lisa better people I
mean

1082
01:03:51,859 --> 01:03:58,730
metallic like doctor dre /a Eminem to
the really have a right to be better

1083
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:02,930
and then go apostle these are the
poorest people in the world

1084
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:07,150
or were considering a that now i mean
dali you can even do that well

1085
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:11,119
and there you really Carphone dali
really well

1086
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:16,279
than any girl however is exactly what
I'd hate to see aspiring musicians wind

1087
01:04:16,279 --> 01:04:16,970
up like

1088
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:20,099
her the crowd at

1089
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:24,579
same question is about at I mean like I
my I suppose my question is that

1090
01:04:24,579 --> 01:04:27,650
I mean what's really the point I mean

1091
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:32,559
the about in taking the RIAA against mp3
that common after

1092
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:36,000
I mean is can anything really be
accomplished well

1093
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,009
that sinister question i mean the for
small there's nothing

1094
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:43,069
thats arm the RIAA can do

1095
01:04:43,069 --> 01:04:46,769
about all the mp3's on everyone's hard
right right now they're not gonna sweep

1096
01:04:46,769 --> 01:04:47,589
through an attack

1097
01:04:47,589 --> 01:04:51,078
I users although Metallica likes to
attack users

1098
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:55,920
are the RIAA does not because it's bad
business to alienate your

1099
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,680
your potential customers and deep in our
hearts they know that the people who are

1100
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,779
collecting mp3's

1101
01:05:00,779 --> 01:05:04,559
are the biggest music fans in the world
so going after

1102
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:07,809
boss me included would be really bad
business are

1103
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:10,539
that's number one so they're not going
to what you just said you re not gonna

1104
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:11,400
go after users

1105
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,410
is are as previous operate cases have
shown

1106
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:19,420
are when the motion picture industry
tried to go after people

1107
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:23,779
for time-shifting for recording a shows
at eight and watching a bit

1108
01:05:23,779 --> 01:05:27,230
at midnight on congress and the courts

1109
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:31,059
always stand up have always stood up for
what for a

1110
01:05:31,059 --> 01:05:34,640
a for what mister and missus America do
in the privacy of their living room

1111
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,970
unless their inlet harried conceptual
potential effect between

1112
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:42,410
people of the same I'm have the same
gender that's that's a totally different

1113
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:43,089
issue than

1114
01:05:43,089 --> 01:05:46,319
however arm a so

1115
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:49,569
so no they're not going to bottle up
that the reason for going after after

1116
01:05:49,569 --> 01:05:50,329
Napster

1117
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:53,950
a is out of frustration and arm

1118
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,329
ultimately it's not its yeah purity I
know but it's all

1119
01:05:57,329 --> 01:06:00,589
it's a strange thing cuz I mean they
gotta know that if they get an

1120
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:03,130
injunction against Napster on July 27

1121
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:07,079
on July 29 all the staff to use and
Romney tower

1122
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:10,259
and there's nobody can sue at that point
arm and

1123
01:06:10,259 --> 01:06:14,039
I mean it's just going to be in amazing
shape everyone knows what's up

1124
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:17,390
arm and and there's really nothing they
can do except

1125
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,759
except that deny all these venture
capitalists are I

1126
01:06:20,759 --> 01:06:24,029
all the money that they've invested in a
company that basically have a good I'm

1127
01:06:24,029 --> 01:06:24,670
convey

1128
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:28,119
don't charge for anything anyway and I
guess one last question is that

1129
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:32,430
what is I haven't heard one response
when the

1130
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:35,730
reasonable reasonably acceptable
response to

1131
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:39,520
the claim in the pac-10 record still too
record sales are up

1132
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:43,690
are up a per set and I listen to the
Senate Judiciary

1133
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:46,720
work hearing on natural isn't like

1134
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:50,700
everything on the news and record sales
were up till

1135
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:55,009
what it what the big deal and a problem
is control they would love

1136
01:06:55,009 --> 01:06:58,609
to get secure digital music it would
love to be able to wrap everything and a

1137
01:06:58,609 --> 01:07:01,170
well would love to be the way that they
deliver this music

1138
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:04,750
and they want it delivered through your
cable box are into a player that they

1139
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:05,869
supply for you

1140
01:07:05,869 --> 01:07:09,609
and their dreams are being dashed
because a couple other a

1141
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:12,690
a couple a very creative programmers
decided

1142
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:15,920
to to make a few simple leaves and the
system are

1143
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,599
and thank goodness for creative
programmers because they're the only

1144
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:20,109
ones protecting

1145
01:07:20,109 --> 01:07:24,700
I us from a completely sealed system

1146
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:28,009
kaelin like I am

1147
01:07:28,009 --> 01:07:31,240
take one more question what am I talked
about right now is we're little bit over

1148
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:31,759
time

1149
01:07:31,759 --> 01:07:34,880
as it I like to comment first the every
type

1150
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,200
seen more control IC market

1151
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,630
not grow him shrank I so the real issue
i think is

1152
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:46,940
how a relief I think is isn't the whole
distribution channel

1153
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:51,319
for music movies 6 Adara controlled by a
small number people

1154
01:07:51,319 --> 01:07:54,529
and what they're really fearful love is
looting back troll

1155
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:58,400
and are we really talking about changing
the whole business model

1156
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:03,910
in such a way that who knows how it will
actually change the long run

1157
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:07,829
but I think I disagree that people are
gonna stop buying

1158
01:08:07,829 --> 01:08:10,980
CDs at all I think that the whole market
is just think it

1159
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:15,349
huge just gonna grow more but it's gonna
be a different market

1160
01:08:15,349 --> 01:08:18,460
it's no longer going to be controlled by
a small number people

1161
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:21,969
is gonna be controlled by a larger group
of people and more independent for

1162
01:08:21,969 --> 01:08:23,989
example will be able to get into the
market

1163
01:08:23,989 --> 01:08:28,120
more be and will be able to get the and
and if the result will be more music

1164
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,229
bought not less

1165
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:33,350
metallica is pissed because a song that
you can't are you couldn't even buy at

1166
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:34,230
the time

1167
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:37,900
was really some years ago unfinished
rarity or something

1168
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:41,130
is an hour that well I think a lot of
people use an app for that

1169
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:45,460
finding some like obscure parking German
b-sides or something like that

1170
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:49,080
not just from the album versions and
that was that I can make a difference

1171
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:49,979
man if you want your

1172
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:53,589
if you like the band you want the album
you want now it's not going to change my

1173
01:08:53,589 --> 01:08:56,899
butt is that bad I mean look at all I
think Madhubala metallica which it

1174
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,929
believes is sponsored by some large
record company

1175
01:08:59,929 --> 01:09:03,290
the Metallica fans are out there looking
for more metallic music they should not

1176
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:06,250
be glad I like it how it should be
flattered that some want to hear

1177
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:09,370
something that might impact unfinished
and now you're gonna find pick up your

1178
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:10,080
gonna disagree

1179
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,229
power but only have one more thing that
some rather have been

1180
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:17,130
way the most socially significant song

1181
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:20,259
up this here maybe this entry

1182
01:09:20,259 --> 01:09:24,469
you wanna to this entry start already up
was American skin by Bruce Springsteen

1183
01:09:24,469 --> 01:09:27,920
which you can only hear an mp3 arm he's

1184
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,199
he's not recorded it he probably won't
record it the guys been a business

1185
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:32,080
twenty five years

1186
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,738
he's released two live albums if you
don't wait for a live burden

1187
01:09:35,739 --> 01:09:40,000
Americans can you be waiting another
15-20 years to get run to another one

1188
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,219
but American skin is about important
public issues

1189
01:09:43,219 --> 01:09:46,750
arm and a and there's been so much
public discussion about because the

1190
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:47,859
police reaction

1191
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:51,239
because I'll are various journalistic
interpretation there's a lot of good

1192
01:09:51,239 --> 01:09:53,779
commentary going on in various
publications

1193
01:09:53,779 --> 01:09:58,260
about what that song actually means and
two but without mp3 there would be none

1194
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,239
of that public discussion

1195
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:04,750
or more question isn't a Napster just
the directory service

1196
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:09,099
I mean if it get shut down because it's
providing a directory services all the

1197
01:10:09,099 --> 01:10:12,409
other directories should be shut down
also

1198
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:16,219
right and that's that many other women
who had will grow in its place

1199
01:10:16,219 --> 01:10:20,210
the next day that's that's why the
argument that NASCAR's gonna make in

1200
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:21,679
their loss or they have made in their

1201
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,690
brief is that it's simply a director in
them person and in writing

1202
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:28,909
to list the stuff against it the other
side that is with the IAEA's planning is

1203
01:10:28,909 --> 01:10:29,848
that

1204
01:10:29,849 --> 01:10:32,639
that its they're contributing copyright
infringement it's not just the

1205
01:10:32,639 --> 01:10:33,820
Directorate said

1206
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:37,199
it's a place it to step up to the mike
get some say

1207
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:41,310
I'm it's a place where you know people
come to share files and so that's

1208
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:44,780
the other argument anywhere last
question lol couple other things

1209
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:48,780
gotta get that the I yet I is not number
one

1210
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:52,230
on the eight percent rise in thedi fail
the third

1211
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:56,650
only news to me I hadn't heard that I
have to question

1212
01:10:56,650 --> 01:11:00,730
what percentage a bad 8 percent actually
came from

1213
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:05,730
independent and what percentage of it
came from the skyrocketing fix

1214
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:09,770
bath and think and and others failed
with

1215
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:12,920
well that one thing that might be
skewing that

1216
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,099
figure and another thing that skewing
the bar that independent for

1217
01:11:16,099 --> 01:11:20,460
automatically growing and will
automatically grow

1218
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:25,130
that is not necessarily true and I mean
fail the money

1219
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:28,130
at least independent rock label: have
been going

1220
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:31,969
deadly down over the past few years

1221
01:11:31,969 --> 01:11:35,370
and party but maybe because more and
more people are listening to hip-hop and

1222
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:38,519
electronic music is another generation
comes up

1223
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:44,219
but another reason is that especially
after the Nirvana explosion and then the

1224
01:11:44,219 --> 01:11:45,860
Green Day explosion

1225
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:50,230
way more people wanted to be in band and
do it themselves or

1226
01:11:50,230 --> 01:11:55,440
and portly trust fund babies also began
starting labels for the wrong reasons

1227
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,980
but the point being more and more cool
bath

1228
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:02,480
more and more cool label but the
audience

1229
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:07,360
did not grow anywhere nearby the same
level

1230
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,598
for the flight to the the pie for those
artists

1231
01:12:10,599 --> 01:12:15,540
get smaller and smaller and smaller and
smaller and smaller

1232
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:19,040
that if not death there early growth

1233
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:23,489
up an individual independent artist
there maybe more artists that the fight

1234
01:12:23,489 --> 01:12:26,610
the Pirates deadly get lots more

1235
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:31,699
okay one more quick question okay it
seems to be a way you're saying is that

1236
01:12:31,699 --> 01:12:36,330
what pisses you off isn't the little guy
just

1237
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:40,889
downloading music to sample and stuff
but when

1238
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:44,940
people take your music and then make
money off it

1239
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:48,370
while you're not making so what's your
question

1240
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:52,389
and while masking you think you'll be
helpful ever copyright

1241
01:12:52,389 --> 01:12:55,840
a audit is Semoran

1242
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,690
to been new I'm

1243
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:04,050
license where it can be distributed

1244
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:07,480
and people still live CDs they are but

1245
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:11,130
company cannot take your music and make
money while that I can then

1246
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:15,770
night taking music and clearer
commercial make money often

1247
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:18,820
well tech technically they can't do that
now I mean I

1248
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:22,280
yeppers course couldn't take someone
signed play on their end without getting

1249
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,309
soon lose and

1250
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:27,280
I mean like we're staying up for yellow
that I've already

1251
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:30,659
but I'm more like coming

1252
01:13:30,659 --> 01:13:33,650
healing but like a licensing scheme
kinda thing right the way the way open

1253
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:37,170
source work yeah exactly right with me.
there already is a kind of

1254
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:40,719
compulsory license for if you want to
version of someone else's song

1255
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:44,670
I say like wet Van Helden cover

1256
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:47,710
you really got me however the picture to
recover winter long by

1257
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:50,830
annually on you have to let the other
band cover it

1258
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:55,070
but that's a different thing from
copying the song but anyway I guess on

1259
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:58,500
would wrap it up through every time it's
like to ass gotta thank me and I'm

1260
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:05,500
ok helped me thank the palace rather and
in

1261
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:14,400
in good

1262
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,500
also thanks to Glenn who came all the
way from Washington DC

1263
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:23,870
to have this panel in

1264
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:25,830
