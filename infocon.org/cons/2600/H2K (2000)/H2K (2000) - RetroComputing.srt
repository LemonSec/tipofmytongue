1
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,020
picture okay

2
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,930
idea this is the richer competing Palin
we will be talking about pressure

3
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:47,850
compute a

4
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,410
I we ever few panelists I'm gonna

5
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,730
give a very British that presentation on
the day

6
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,589
trs-80 color computer two minutes maybe
show I can

7
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:03,960
have more time for other people I am
sammich burger

8
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,850
as Matt bachelor's and master's degrees
in computer sciences

9
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,009
airs presently pursuing his PhD in
Computer Science

10
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:14,899
his work for ten years in software
engineering and security field with

11
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:18,340
multiple national international
publications in presentation matters

12
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,880
related to computing security in ethics
he may be contacted at San

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,710
I am Sandakan and its website is WWW dot

14
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,590
I am Sam dot com he'll be speaking about
the Apple to any interesting things you

15
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,710
can do with innovation and okay

16
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,240
yeah the night stalker

17
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,130
was born in Bridgeport Connecticut 1951
and currently lives in Boston

18
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:47,420
is important she DC for over 10 years
Commodore user since 1985

19
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,289
he'll be talking about the c64 and why
it's God's gift to humanity

20
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:58,050
skin

21
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,120
graphics is some kid I met in an IRC re

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,390
yeah integration stuff so I i

23
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,460
guess I just led him to speak anything
you talking about

24
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,560
the legacy that the systems have today
and

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,860
I am mister armey known to most people
like mister

26
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,160
and that's it so Inc night stop

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,640
thank you thank you hang hi

28
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,640
homework again would begin arm I decided
to start with the Commodore 64 because

29
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,900
it was damn cheap

30
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,470
the Apple the time was retailing for

31
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,370
are corporately Nexus 5000 dollars
whereas the economy or was in the

32
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,780
four hundred dollar range I

33
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,750
if you bought a brand new I bought my
system used for about three hundred

34
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,250
dollars at a Commodore 64 a monitor on a
disk drive

35
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,220
I also came with a printer interface and
the dataset drive

36
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,709
today I still use the commenting system
I have come under 128 which has been

37
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,340
heavily tricked-out hardware hack to
Helen gone

38
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,480
I'll and the only bits the remaining
original system where the day takes a

39
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,959
drive in the printer interface

40
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,220
everything else has changed a

41
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,980
64 was in many respects

42
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,690
a I an entry computer for a lot of
people and that again was an expensive

43
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,250
and surprisingly powerful for could do

44
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,590
you would think that you know this day
in age a machine that runs one maker

45
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,450
john is a whopping 64 kilobytes of
memory

46
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,900
you know that's that's a keyboard buffer
but

47
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,300
through clever programming and

48
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,239
you know literally getting down there in
hammering on the air so account for some

49
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:48,940
language

50
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:54,170
64 and with 128 could do things the
dishonest people even today

51
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,510
I for example announced text editors

52
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,549
no now will text editor if it's
well-written

53
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,299
and women well-crafted me but I code can
do virtually anything that the

54
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:11,130
you earlier versions were perfect could
do but you don't need a whacking big MS

55
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,820
DOS machine American actor do it in

56
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,089
I am now I know well as several

57
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,269
PhD dissertations the original Commodore
64

58
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,270
notes the the only thing that counts as
one looks

59
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,690
with what looks like on paper not how
you do it I mean the

60
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,590
in the good old days we had a a good
nature snobbery amongst us computer

61
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,639
users to the Commodore 64 people bash
the Apple people

62
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,580
the Apple people and bash the Atari
people and everyone would dump on IBM

63
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,250
day I so today

64
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,380
people ask me what the hell can you do
with the sink their doorstep the

65
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,170
monikers

66
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,490
again with clever programming

67
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,160
and all of you harbor ditions getting on
the internet is not a problem

68
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,730
a even at high speed demon 56k modem

69
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,639
there is a marvelous company in
massachusetts called CMP devices

70
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,889
I website is www CMD web

71
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:10,070
dot com I believe but Webster to wider
for you and they produce a variety of

72
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,139
hardware

73
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:14,580
and firmware accessories for the
Commodore I

74
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,520
they have a gadget call the turbo

75
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,590
232 interface lujan cartridge see

76
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,610
get the same of not much bigger than
this 1200 baud modem

77
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:33,130
and a plugs into expansion port on the
back of the computer here

78
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,990
and 140 thing but the calmer was their
wires

79
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,210
everywhere so you have to have to bear
with me

80
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,270
so those things cardboard our expansion
port

81
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,549
most people used for game cartridges and
what not but this is a bus that goes

82
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,540
directly into the system bus

83
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,870
and with the RS 232 October 23 to card
rather

84
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,949
which is I believe and a CIA adapter

85
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,490
I you can have the Commodore 64

86
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,690
I'm second in and sport not data at
upwards of

87
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,360
think 200 kilobits per second

88
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,250
which is a pretty darn good

89
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,990
I which means no 56k modem is trivial

90
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,760
other things unseemly produces

91
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,000
well hard drive for the Commodore 64

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,410
yeah yeah

93
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,660
what they do is they have an interface

94
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,220
but in a box I am which turns

95
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,760
well bed space is a translation
interesting interface the

96
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,570
a serial dater the comes out on the
counter serial port to this big ol 20

97
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,349
disk drive

98
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,970
goes in the SEL converter and comes out
as parallel skizzy

99
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,320
Carlos cuz he comes in as well

100
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,990
serial for Commodore and Commodore
doesn't notice a damn thing it just

101
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,860
things that say

102
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,490
really big floppy drive

103
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,640
so I they started all 20 megabyte hard
drives and now are my Mandarin

104
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,340
you can put his no whatever the largest
skizzy drive is today

105
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,390
you could put into this thing and a
commoner would just sit there happily

106
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,900
user

107
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,600
I another one other thing um

108
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,900
all there there some some this man is
the combo I'll one was atrocious lease

109
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,320
loan disk access I i mean this thing

110
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,849
this thing doesn't reader/writer uploads
and downloads for the district 300 baud

111
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,310
yeah so after the

112
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,030
the very first thing than 90 percent
over counter users bought after they get

113
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,660
the Commodore 64 was the epics Paslode
cartridge

114
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,560
this the small software degree poker in
speeding up this guy a pretty pretty

115
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,690
good

116
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:51,750
I am and also had a built-in machine
language monitor

117
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,670
and been giving up giving a monitor to
some people it's like giving whiskey and

118
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,650
car keys a teenage boys

119
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,800
and a from there be we came into what
was called the demo seem

120
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,230
with Commodore something her call the
picture to deal with a friendship

121
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,090
a programmable device amazing depth and
breadth

122
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,300
that if you know how to do it you can do
things the most honest people

123
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,390
I'll come under has a screen resolution
0

124
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,830
320 by 206 all the high res motor which
means you can have a background color

125
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,330
and a four-run color

126
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,760
that said usually black-on-white

127
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,799
in the medium rose mode is 160 by two
hundred

128
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,089
what that means is the horizontal
resolution image pixel is

129
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:42,860
double arm because you had to get around
certain limitations remember back in the

130
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,459
good ol days Ram was expensive

131
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:48,910
amendment to her for a moment I back in
the

132
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,990
mid-seventies 8k

133
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:57,760
RAM if I recall correctly would cost
approximately two thousand dollars

134
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,019
and would come on a card

135
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,450
I about yeeee big will plug into a a a
big

136
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,560
big old expansion cage now

137
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,019
try and find in a kilobyte ship now so

138
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,839
Rams expensive so you had to offer too
clever tricks to get around it

139
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,310
and the pic ship was pretty clever
device you know what it was supposed to

140
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,269
do

141
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,850
but once you got people who were
interested in programming industry in

142
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,760
finding out as much as you do with this
thing

143
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,269
they were getting this thing to jump
through hoops that were never intended

144
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,519
to be june thru

145
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,870
I am know the story I

146
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,950
countries to have they called worldcom
overexposed in westchester pennsylvania

147
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,399
where their headquartered

148
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:42,740
and people come from all over the world
and set up their computers

149
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,680
himself things to them straight whatever
so there's a demo

150
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,370
writing crew from Europe there they had
a demo going on

151
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,160
and the screen was doing stuff like you
wouldn't believe you know you see the Z

152
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,600
the borders

153
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,709
are theoretically nothing go there well

154
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:02,519
be all good demo or can put anything
they really make the screen expand and

155
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:02,920
just

156
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,760
go text scrolling all four sides to
Mason things

157
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,000
saw an older gentleman is looking at
this and he's looking at is peering out

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,940
from

159
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,930
saying he's looking at the computer any
family asks okok had a

160
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,410
how did you modify the commoner to do
that and again so we can come back and

161
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,110
do not solve all software not migrate
you tell me

162
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:26,820
no just between us guys how did you how
to hack the commenter

163
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,470
now total software tall we're all just
remove the picture

164
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,770
and his as well you know I designed a
picture

165
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:41,010
it can't do that a

166
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,050
so they apparently set all oh wow great
cracking up sites like meeting you know

167
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:50,020
p.m. steve wozniak somewhere I know no
one heroes love the computer revolution

168
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,310
and you know they that they should look
own everything the pointing out that way

169
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,820
into the guide the design the picture

170
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,440
how they made his baby do things missing
amazing

171
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,000
so are it today me that there are people
that get on the internet will come a 64

172
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,770
or 128 I think nothing other

173
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,949
it's it's not that difficult from a
hardware/software standpoint the hard

174
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,840
part

175
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,820
is just finding an ISP that'll give you
a dial-up show account

176
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,000
everyone wants to go I know TCPIP

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,890
when you gonna do well right now there
are experimental TCPIP stacks the work

178
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,600
on the Commodore 64

179
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,410
they do take a bar room is not a whole
lot of space left over

180
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:34,089
blot it is being worked on and I will
prophesies that within two or three

181
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,390
years

182
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:39,120
there'll be a PCP ICP application

183
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,540
for the 64 and 128 the will let you do
virtually everything

184
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,990
that Pinot mainstream computer can do
today

185
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:52,520
we'll perhaps the exceptional graphics
your view that 16 callers on this thing

186
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,660
I which was a consider pretty good back
in the day

187
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,829
and thank you you know I'll

188
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,750
with the the picture began you get you
get into that and you can do things

189
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,560
YouTube page flipping you can do up be
no

190
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,020
restaurant corrupts you can get thirty
two thousand dollars on a counter 64

191
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,670
screen

192
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:21,069
if you don't when scrolling a
back-and-forth you can get

193
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,279
be a large images on a commoner screen

194
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:29,500
in that will 320 by 206 I'll

195
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,860
if you don't mind hardware hacking your
cum over 128 in putting a second century

196
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,839
for Sun interface device

197
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,680
with all software you can play mp3's

198
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,410
a course you need to have the hard drive
to do that

199
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,029
it's damn hard to put you know mp3
annable floppy disk that has

200
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:51,670
soon the Kyle you forget how much

201
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,520
forget how much is a hand he's happens
and so on it's not a whole lot

202
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,100
it's not a whole lot yeah I

203
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,710
and other things that were done with a
comment or were clever

204
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,390
you know stupid districts you could do
things were bad there was one marble

205
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,770
gimmick

206
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,890
because the comer to strive

207
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,610
this so this big clunky beige box

208
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,180
the wind power supply is an intelligent
peripheral

209
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:25,610
as a city 510 processor Nick in other
words it's at least as smart as an app

210
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,120
no offense intended so and has 2k

211
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,570
RAM in it so you can program the
Commodore 64

212
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,520
I rather the Commodore 5041 to strive

213
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,120
I was gonna bring a program with me but
I was and I i had such a a I'm

214
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,890
weird a Thursday getting down here I
left my discs at home I really read it

215
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,980
there's a program if anyone has a
Commodore 64 and confined

216
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,460
call 1541 Music Machine

217
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,810
and what this I let me get the program
is he musta been on crack or something

218
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,160
a what it does

219
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,949
it turns the Commodore 1541 destroyed
into a sound synthesizing device

220
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,020
by the do we think when I listen to be
terrible things to the

221
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,890
to them to the motor the moon's the
read/write head back and forth

222
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,939
thing plays bicycle built for two

223
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,810
and at em don't do it Hannah

224
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,760
for I swear I so I'm not making this up
I'm not on drugs

225
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:36,279
true I does another and another stupid
destroyed Trika

226
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,689
again programming at I have you read
really red light on the front here which

227
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,140
is %uh your power

228
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,470
indicates you have things turned on/off
are what you can do is you can have

229
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:52,529
the power on light slowly fade all off
and on all of a non

230
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:56,040
and you you YouTube you run this on
someone as a prank

231
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,029
and say oh my I think you drive broken
man

232
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:03,120
and that free guide to turn onto trucks
truck

233
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,180
I am

234
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,029
the other two stripe uploading and
downloading the three newborn what the

235
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:11,580
heck is that about

236
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,700
well because it had to be compatible
with

237
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,370
the vic-20 which was designed around

238
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:23,570
a tape drive now the eye or teens and
computer are not that bright

239
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,589
and was intended to be used for a
cassette deck cause

240
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:30,660
to strive to get these things for us or
six hundred dollars when they were new

241
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,560
now who pay six hundred dollars for a
floppy drive the today's

242
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,850
so I there were clever software tricks
for this too

243
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,339
increase our ISP and are these good
folks it seem'd decided well thats

244
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:48,550
that's kinda still will do better may
have something called you feed us

245
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,620
Mizoram a question sir which a

246
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,700
speeds up disk i/o by

247
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,020
think fifteen times was pretty darn good
an awesome show the things you can now

248
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,260
some young simple to to keep your
command

249
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:09,660
UK and print a file to the screen much
like the type command and ms-dos

250
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,949
I you can direct the printer I

251
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,490
you have what's called a wedge that is
simply a little

252
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,290
software the widgets off into the OS
that allows you to really simplify

253
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,529
keyboard commands

254
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:26,680
know for example I wanted to do
something with the drive

255
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,950
be open 15 come up fifteen

256
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,790
no open 15 come by 8:15 Colin

257
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,740
command to initialize the disk I close
15 return

258
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,730
you know what that's like ms. stop for
god sakes are

259
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,520
whereas with the wedges like and I
return and your disk is described as a

260
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,939
lysed

261
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,839
which made life a lot easier for people
I am

262
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:56,300
you wanna swap cum or jeans and
Pinterest arms I said can be you know

263
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,240
users on the internet we the people
doing today

264
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,189
I which can spark a resurgence in UNIX

265
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,850
learning UNIX among people people by by
the Commodores

266
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,688
and you learn all the ins and outs of
%ah the Commodore and then wanna get

267
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:13,390
online and then discover

268
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,770
algata have learned is you next thing

269
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,459
and then discover what unit is not
difficult kinda fun actually

270
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,339
going to all the stuff on a host
computer

271
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:27,500
was going to with UNIX she

272
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,450
missus Linux I hear about in and they
wind up getting a 46 box and the

273
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,200
wonderful learning Linux

274
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,630
and up you know another another customer
lost

275
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:43,240
from Microsoft payout yeah

276
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,529
and some I mean I know I know people
that the star 164

277
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:51,159
121 online learned learned unix/linux

278
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:54,490
and the discover the hey I can make
money with this

279
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,090
and they're now administrating units
machines and unit in the limits networks

280
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,970
for huge amounts of money but they still
home to the Commodores

281
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,470
because thats machine they they were in
its machine they know arm

282
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,620
I use commoner 128 that's my main
computer

283
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,700
I have a Mac 2s I which is solely for
internet access

284
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,539
arm I have won all my games are on the
Commodore

285
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:22,690
I and i think that they're a lot better
than what we have today on

286
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:26,679
help end in threes in Big Macs I know
Doom and Quake in that lot that's all

287
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:29,390
very nice in a really cool graphics

288
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:33,279
but it's basically no point in kill I

289
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,600
know when when is the last time I know
some company released you know

290
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,370
adventurers orc

291
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,640
and I'll you know P

292
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,870
that he had what fast-twitch enough s
muscles which games are all out there

293
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,789
but a game we have to sit there in

294
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:53,690
in a stare at the screen thing okay now
what is this me

295
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,940
you try something me try something

296
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,380
and eventually get an ad that that's for
more satisfying than

297
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,830
you know killing monsters you taking
their guns

298
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,330
because it is hope it didn't teach him
it makes you think you know that's a

299
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,590
good thing

300
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,709
I no not the blowing wage a little
monsters in Quakers and

301
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,720
is isn't fun you know there are times
when you just got to kill stuff

302
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,900
K I and that's good

303
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,610
I also said I want him to run that I
love adventure games a lot of thinking

304
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:24,980
and

305
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,160
try to have a couple shoot 'em ups and
there is a dum clone for the Commodores

306
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,150
call mood

307
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,820
yeah I the graphics are really primitive

308
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,639
given the limitations but I've seen it I
I fooled around with it and

309
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,049
as a in horror as a dum clone running on
a one megahertz machine with 64k a

310
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:47,540
memory in a bad

311
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,928
I my text editor something called BB
writer

312
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:56,370
herein by one guy that lives in arizona

313
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,049
and coupled with a good point reyes
Panasonic 24 print printer

314
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:04,429
arm my output is just as good as any in
terms of a laser printer

315
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:07,730
and that's all that matters you know it
it's it's doesn't matter what kinda

316
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,450
printer is as long as it looks good

317
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,320
that's what gets the point across so you
don't need

318
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,370
a and m3 orgy for a laser printer

319
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,710
to have your station you're not sure
whether your correspondence come across

320
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,520
looking well

321
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,740
which show leads me to another thing
these things

322
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,299
come use commoner system is incredibly
cheap

323
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:34,290
are you can pick them up the MIT flea
market in Massachusetts

324
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:38,540
you know what I got sitting in front of
me much twenty-five dollars

325
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,139
your computer a modern a disk drive and
our

326
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,970
what I what I do occasionally when I
only have the money in Indian can do it

327
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,510
or someone needs needs to help arm

328
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,580
I hope all's people in organizations set
up

329
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,510
things using a comet or know they can't
afford to you and we haven't lost me a

330
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,190
lot

331
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,630
some reason have a lot of haitians in
Boston now you don't think

332
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:04,280
you mean you think haitians wanna live
someplace warm oster the hearing

333
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,559
I'm of two we gets knocked armpit
sometimes but that's the way it is

334
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,570
so all of these folks are just dirt-poor

335
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,580
and the organizations that try to help
the murder poor

336
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,299
and they think you know what we can
afford a computer would rather spend the

337
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,090
money

338
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,480
to help our people so you show up when
these places were

339
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,250
monitor computer drive in a printer

340
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:32,030
and a couple discuss software new got a
freeware text editor freeware mailing

341
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,500
was program

342
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,309
I'll freeware %um print shop

343
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:40,520
and suddenly hears his poor group lookin

344
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,910
send out letters they have a mailing
list

345
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,429
they can print up flyers they can do
newsletters

346
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:51,630
and they can do them in haitian which
has lotta back critical marks based on

347
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,440
French

348
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,350
because the Commodore 64 you can load in
new character sets

349
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,780
you're not limited to what spilled into
the ROM

350
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,620
so yes you can have custom character
sets with all those little French a

351
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,799
back remarks the people good people
speak

352
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,389
patient real can read and suddenly

353
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,799
is no longer a person to person you know
one person is how one person told one

354
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,970
person

355
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,530
they can mail out stuff to their fellow
Haitians

356
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:23,139
or the fellow Jamaicans or other fellow
Ukrainians are the following questions

357
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,190
whatever and this puts them on equal
footing

358
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,299
with any in the larger organizations

359
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:33,879
because you know the data doesn't care
what it's on

360
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,240
the only things important is how you get
on paper and how you get it on the net

361
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,850
and how you get people

362
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,940
and you can do all that with a Commodore
64

363
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,679
up can be in these things these things
will be running

364
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,910
until there are no more parts available

365
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,700
you know when when the last comment or
is been cannibalized

366
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,309
to fix the last working Commodore
that'll be it now be sometime

367
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:01,540
well into the next century I

368
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,629
and I'm sure the same thing to be so the
Apple though the ferry

369
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,730
and we have an apple person right here

370
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,020
who died lightweight like to take over
cuz I'm gonna emerge saying

371
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:20,020
Khan subject thank you

372
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,700
today here

373
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:29,070
okay you can be good

374
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,580
okay moment talk a bit about the Apple
in general most particularly makes

375
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,260
reaches the Apple to model

376
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,460
I 1976 the first Apple one kids were
made available

377
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,290
basically handle machine five-course
Wozniak and jobs

378
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:48,170
arm the first batch only 50 were
produced and I understand it total

379
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,730
numbers only in the few hundreds

380
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,840
arm the Apple to in two-plus

381
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,520
were mass-produced dinner technically no
more interesting

382
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:04,570
whitetails a the Apple to really took a
stride 1978 missing I believe is it

383
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:04,970
yours

384
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:10,220
ATP in product in its sales that's also
when the visit Cal

385
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,570
special program came out I'll 230,000
Apple to seoul

386
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:19,810
by a september 1980 25,000 specifically
running visit Cal

387
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:23,260
solo sail directly helped by business
aP's

388
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,990
are after the Apple to the Apple 3
emerged

389
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,280
let's just say that in the village
promise yes

390
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,050
back then you are the same laughter when
people so and so the price relative to

391
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,710
what you got you from the Apple to as
you just heard a moment ago

392
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:42,110
a had weak sales Apple to see came out
later

393
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,580
I am

394
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:50,070
I don't know off hand I i was thinkin
making notes on a Lisa but

395
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:55,240
IIID in Canterbury know where the tree
was in an interesting machine personally

396
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,610
arm failure yeah here

397
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:05,450
yeah army you just him every dollar gyd
image child

398
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,060
yeah it really

399
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,780
lil the Lisa really

400
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,780
died in bed death and I'm not sure had a
very enlightened birth either

401
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,710
okay anyway I i'm gonna move right along
now

402
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,880
on the upper to see was portable had
more memory more capabilities came up

403
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,940
briefly after the Apple to we will be
hyped up the two of us kindly

404
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,220
to on steroids he was something she like
he comes to do

405
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,180
some nice word processing little more
memory 64-team actually card got tired

406
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,310
28k

407
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,629
chicken were with got more data arm

408
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:44,720
now one thing I seem very interesting
the apple two series

409
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,340
was that you had a very interesting for
shadowing the IBM PC hardware interrupt

410
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,530
request problem

411
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,620
that only in country since almost the
whole USB port situation

412
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,450
not yet 7 slot snapple to cart yet 48k

413
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,840
you base RAM generally speaking we put
in a memory card

414
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,740
inside 0 it when you bring a controller
card yeah did you describe card

415
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,950
but the copy discs a whole lot multiple
drive controller cards

416
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,370
zoned out to drive and controller yes
your card

417
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:19,140
and a modem card your econ card well you
down out about two spots remaining

418
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:24,150
you have ninety said he was nice normal
capabilities now

419
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,900
3120 faster process well the 6502

420
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,130
processor was the basis for everything
for the Apple that was the heartbeat

421
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,350
and we had was a whole lot %uh logic
trend low-power Scott

422
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:39,410
devices 74 LS series chipset 74 L 00
chips

423
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,960
very simple reason work with you know
what ship goes bad

424
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,410
the poppy put another check but not sure
which it is replaced couple chips nobody

425
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,690
really cost about 50 cents at the time
maybe two dollars

426
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,520
most ships was nice arm I'll mention

427
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,700
a reckoning when do this was a cute
little gimmick Apple drops a great

428
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,250
warranties one or two years

429
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,090
well what happened is what if you had
five drives one bro

430
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,480
well the warranty informations CEP a
sticker on the back and we'll talk about

431
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,510
the case

432
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:11,980
yet internal warranties was kinda nice I
would recommend doing such a thing and

433
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,550
if I win on the warranty now but

434
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:17,780
yeah it was done quite a bit and a
beautiful of service policy

435
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,800
now you do homemade 151

436
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,420
it drops rating tool assembly to put in
machine contractions you want to put in

437
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,150
a machine programed member dress your
300 index

438
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:32,110
he died in 0:03 00 colon nuclear issue
with hexadecimal numbers

439
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:36,810
and it goes in as machine language
coating I'll

440
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,919
the Apple to itself not the plus
actually had a built-in in many a summer

441
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,660
as well

442
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:45,600
UN carnegie 151 give the address at the
many a summer at 666 G

443
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,750
and it did the G goes invokes a menu
somewhere

444
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,110
arm and it really encourage you to play
with the system

445
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:56,110
in in that regard you got assembler me a
seller

446
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:00,510
machine code access all built-in are you
likely does something

447
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:05,660
again a lot of the environment was wrong
but you don't like it then see seller's

448
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,070
summer talk it seems to take multiple
discs to load

449
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,629
you can also hear on basic into too long
you compile basics

450
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:16,950
suffering interpreted welcome powerfully
in bed excusable code are you said some

451
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,740
fun things like fourteen others we have
total graphics which

452
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,570
are I never really using into too much
experiment really was because he thought

453
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,970
other paradise for computing even then
encourage you to think

454
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:30,490
about how you can represent things now
that you have to be when

455
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:34,520
in one method with your site somewhere
languages and mom to comment or oh yes

456
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:38,820
arm often offering systems you wanted to
Pascal University of California San

457
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,950
Diego Pascal

458
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:46,590
taking with it a listen by Armin fortran
is based on the same environment to

459
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,240
are for business purposes people guess
he PMed car you caress you can maybe

460
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,630
beautifully on your Apple

461
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:58,000
now in that request another expansion
slot I

462
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,340
at same from you have India IBM's now

463
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,890
there was really open computing I think
foreshadow modern open

464
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,810
competing thought made to ride around
this time period but

465
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:13,580
the scene's changed to see I've got a
card here gated copyright 1981

466
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:18,669
has eath if I think that's a good one
maker chipped in a compassionate 6502

467
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:22,760
and it has a whole lot a little LSU
recent logic chips in your very simple

468
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,570
logic just

469
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:28,129
gates as I stop it out what's
interesting is who want to 20 p.m. ET on

470
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,000
your Apple

471
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,400
who is this leader this morning a little
thought it would be great to run

472
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,570
multiple environments on a computer

473
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:41,210
well this product is a Microsoft
consumer products of card

474
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,660
things changed that churchill

475
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,160
film clinton also can you go to talk
thing

476
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,230
terms accused your at that still
Microsoft logo

477
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:59,230
if they will if anyone can do it later
became close up no

478
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,379
absolutely yes yet he a chips the chips

479
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,810
me mom now

480
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,629
to me most interesting thing that went
on was where the security issues with

481
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,570
the Apple TV lot legal security things

482
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:16,370
are now like other machines at the time
yeah no password protection by us but

483
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,570
that's not a big deal

484
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,790
you can lock your door get to the same
effect

485
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:25,280
Valley no big deal now again
illumination play with for example the

486
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,790
game

487
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:32,790
local Castle Wolfenstein you went around
shooting the bad guy spacecraft

488
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,190
that was fun yeah now you can hack that

489
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:45,190
now I'm not even mention cattle smirking
steamroll the bad guys in places I i

490
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:49,010
I a estar to let them to music in

491
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:53,500
now to open letter there were drugs time
yeah

492
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,910
that you can put in a little read write
toggle switch on a drive you did

493
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:01,090
toggle the right naval alright protect
sensor mmm some drives everyone is there

494
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:01,920
an assistant

495
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,910
you push the button in rate nablas
protect was a invoking over in

496
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,870
let down as you go to counseling to
remind us what she thought the desk open

497
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:14,360
never write to you die

498
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,440
so you get killed you know goal is back
till beginning at the whole

499
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,110
cannot remove your sizzling might remove
the thing you come back any rate we

500
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,380
entered that room

501
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,260
so we have to play version castle of st.
long time and this drive

502
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:31,850
door hinge yeah I play is I

503
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,300
could hit you can overrated the whole
time can't keep the disclose all time

504
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,770
cuz want to serve the test do mystery
whole game

505
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:42,620
now we had sought sector desks which
made for other games

506
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,240
T oldest love the CPM systems love you
eight-inch

507
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,290
disk systems you had a whole in addition
we suppose the dist

508
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,860
but really shone a light through and I'm

509
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,990
not necessarily always use shit
presently but

510
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,500
know he was shining through an
essentially let know that's when the the

511
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,540
moment

512
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,190
the whole was passing through it tell
what track in sector rather which oddly

513
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,700
track you looking at

514
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,970
which track identify going passively
track 0 every time it got at all

515
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,040
paying well heart check your discs

516
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,270
knows where it is and he's timing other
tracks sub-sector just young do that you

517
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:20,389
put in address headers other pieces of
information to let you know what you're

518
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,730
looking at

519
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:26,659
well with this led to his copy
protection schemes

520
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:30,960
tip immediately having suppose using
Donelson do not interesting

521
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,460
now what we could do is a a company like
a Tory with their charges of product and

522
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,630
we could change the address headers

523
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:42,800
if you copy software is looking for d5
AAA 7965 AAA

524
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,890
be you to copy protect you copies of
2010 was copying

525
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:50,659
to attract editors you can open up the
file ok look at tragedy

526
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:54,620
well where the using is headers where
the using his other

527
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,880
important parametric information and
this encourage deal

528
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,650
well I'm used to encourage to think
about the environment what it takes to

529
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,250
copy things

530
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,320
arm in the stragglers looking
information

531
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,620
tell we wanted how to change primers to
copy you could

532
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,870
single-step drive Miller perhaps debt

533
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:17,140
so you could rate uneven patterns the
distance at the tractor you want you can

534
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,740
rate of

535
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,890
at beyond what should have been largely
nm the disk based on how was defined

536
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:25,440
and this led to a lot of his really play
I at some point though

537
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,020
always got made into parameters for
copies of three just put it into a

538
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,418
program you had

539
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:33,720
before one can really learn a lot by

540
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,650
thing I had a copy discs could be aged
action Chicco breaking

541
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:41,570
to network to put a close analysis
immediate get great opportunities to

542
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,450
think I'm with about 25 minutes

543
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:49,429
okay 3 I'll do what I can I

544
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:52,880
okay now %uh the Apple cat modem

545
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,820
was produced by Novation things was
interesting products ever produced

546
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,790
it allowed the time to hook up your
Apple cat modem to your machine

547
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,770
with a little ron shipp it could
understand touchtone codes

548
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:09,570
are it produced there was soccer calmly
available

549
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,500
that would produce very many interesting
tones I believe that would produce awful

550
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,000
close

551
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,370
you have your 139 have you can use your
own you're startin

552
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:20,319
I believe those his tone a through E
needn't

553
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,270
you want to start the running things
that they can do there is another Costa

554
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,929
now are you can also produce different
onto that built in programmable d/a

555
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:29,109
converter

556
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:32,989
you can make almost 821 you could boost
way 600 headstones

557
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:37,060
part hit me EMF DTMF

558
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,020
yes it did those you could use all kinds
a chance arm

559
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,520
you cannot abuse our caller tones nickel
tones dying tones

560
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,580
and I was all very reason interest in a
magazine article How to Train Your Home

561
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,069
phone to a payphone you wanna confuse
your friendly local %uh

562
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,980
telephone company turn your home phone
into a pay phone and get the quarter

563
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,620
tones

564
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:59,600
in are it also could produce as a
centrist undertone

565
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,660
I should let me bring in a cab
incredulously when he wants you a little

566
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,609
town like the

567
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:10,540
cave in to block a whole were premature
right one but we both just make sure I

568
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,759
hit

569
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,570
and God only on one side and look at
crunch on the other

570
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:23,300
yeah K

571
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,250
yet yeah

572
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,290
and you're now under arrest for
possessing a mischievous device

573
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,860
you okay anyway I'll conclude rapidly

574
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,560
I saw the Apple to has been very
interesting machine to learn from

575
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,100
and it all had a will provide a
wonderful bases tapping respect

576
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,029
understanding

577
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,130
for fundamental security issues

578
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,510
but was also just great to play with the
available temperate technologies the

579
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,110
time

580
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,200
is we can really do with logic chips and
simple process

581
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:57,370
thank you yeah

582
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:00,880
5300 like to say that virtually
everything he said about the the Apple

583
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,500
to also apply to the Commodore

584
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,750
their their sensually cousins I'll so
that it wasn't so much you know an angry

585
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,770
rivalry is more like a family feud

586
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,759
between Appleton comer users yup I'll
just mention that all the fun in that

587
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,160
Apple's encounters with respect each
others are

588
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,310
choice in computers but the end the day
that he sat down had such as talking

589
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,090
pictures were good friends at really

590
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:26,000
yeah

591
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,720
day

592
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,790
a get the picture kinda running it on
your show I'm gonna make my day

593
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:37,440
Coco speech even shorter than it was

594
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,460
and we're going to go into graphics a
speech and then we're gonna have very

595
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,680
brief question answer and then we're
going to

596
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,299
if we have time we're gonna auction of
an IBM workstation

597
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,640
and Coco chill 10 so

598
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,029
hopefully we'll have enough time to that
okay so I'm gonna be talking very

599
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,820
briefly that the charity coca

600
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,690
your time Bay I

601
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,820
if you're wondering why this kid up
you're talking about computers that were

602
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,900
made a

603
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,520
10 my years before he was born doesn't

604
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,560
question the answer is I was always
interested in computers when I was very

605
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,290
small

606
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,520
and the type computers that I'm

607
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,090
talking about here with leaders are
around it so

608
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,430
I just became very interested in finding
out

609
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:27,700
what was around before me and for

610
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:32,400
RAM when I was born so in the process
kinda having a history lesson I became

611
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,380
very interested

612
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,760
in these computers because am

613
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,210
there's a lot of things it are missing

614
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:44,630
from your computer chips that they have
so

615
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,480
mission uptown start talking about this
um

616
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,370
I found the Miko go to store for twenty
dollars

617
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:57,190
I had no idea what the hell it was and I
and twenty dollars I won by an old

618
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:57,910
computer

619
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:01,359
it was a lot cheaper than the Atari 800
they're selling so I bought it

620
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,020
I I didn't really know it was buying
them GLaDOS

621
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,000
bought it because it I gotta much more
unique system

622
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,510
I'm gonna got a little time in the
history of the

623
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:17,700
Co a as many of you know in 1977

624
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,960
10 corporation you release the terrorist
eighty which is their big day

625
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,470
in my computer market and there's a one
fan way over there

626
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,470
this is lovingly called Treasury

627
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:32,690
for for many reasons and it was a

628
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:36,670
third of the first three consumer ready
home computers

629
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:41,160
I unfortunately or fortunately the Apple
to

630
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,029
defeat in the market 1978 actually

631
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,280
pretty much in late 1977 mom

632
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,880
that same year Taney

633
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,240
began talks with Motorola to create a
very inexpensive

634
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,580
home computer and I am

635
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:03,430
nothing really came in at first but can
use invited

636
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:07,169
to make the computers for and
agricultural project which was

637
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,030
code-named project green thumb

638
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,440
it was meant to give

639
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,210
data to farmers three terminals

640
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:22,000
I at the end project green thumb
motorola's ready to make processor

641
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,420
that could be used inexpensive home
appear that could be plugged into on

642
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,660
television so

643
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:32,490
three years after the trs-80 the first
Coco was

644
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:36,310
released it was this is actually
cockatoo

645
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,560
came in this still in box this chick lit
like keyboard

646
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,810
very awkward looking and no it
originally came with

647
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:47,930
4k ran a cane rum basic and it was

648
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,319
there's like that big and a

649
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,480
people I mean it enemy team success I
couldn't

650
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,600
the Google one could do very much but
even with those humble beginnings

651
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,150
on that Coco a lot of amazing things
were created

652
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:07,090
on the

653
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:11,390
the heart a little Coco was a Motorola
chip

654
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:14,970
the six 809 eat and this

655
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:19,210
it was quite remarkable at the time
because when most you can only you

656
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:24,050
8-bit processes it could do several
sixteen-bit processes

657
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:28,780
which was unheard of personal computers
at the time um

658
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:33,220
another thing it was quite small for
Michael Clarke processors at

659
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:37,380
screwdriver kit open it up and show you

660
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,460
yeah nm it's really fachet

661
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,540
a CPU am to it it was

662
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,840
it was light years ahead Motorola 6502

663
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:54,120
yes got he got me her she went home I am

664
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:59,509
they came in the Apple it but it never
became quite popular Seattle to

665
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:03,210
I am

666
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,630
a few years later the co 2 was released
which is this

667
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,780
which slightly smaller came with the
Better Keyboard what was basically the

668
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,960
same

669
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,270
real revolution didn't come until 1986

670
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:21,540
go play I am that's when the cocoa 3 was
released

671
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,900
that was a really remarkable machine
because

672
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,300
it had a processor well another chip

673
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:33,020
it took strain of the processor by
rendering the graphics

674
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,890
so basically you how to process your
free do many things

675
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:41,190
and it didn't wasn't what held down by
the graphics

676
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:46,210
I think the thing that makes the 03 very
very remarkable is that

677
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:50,090
fact that is one first multi tasking
home computers

678
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,350
ed became more you could buy

679
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:56,990
I should say an operating system called
OS 9

680
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:00,530
on it came with the a girly

681
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,790
that was kinda light when does expose
more like me DOS

682
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:10,230
but it and it was you could run multiple
windows at a time

683
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:13,650
and then this was

684
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:17,480
I'd like you to know that early
incarnations village nine came out

685
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,230
at least two or three years before
Windows and Mac OS

686
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:26,040
because they wish being used in small
quantities ok ok I want is

687
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:30,310
so basically this kind of technology

688
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:33,930
they were the first to use Skype
technology I think a

689
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,529
got almost stole it from Xerox as well

690
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,960
so on the coca 3 can

691
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,350
in 722 TV can be pulled into an RGB
minor

692
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:50,080
I am although it could still be fun to
do a TV shows

693
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:55,100
slightly more popular on it came with
512 K

694
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,510
but it could be I'll she can 128 K the
upgrade

695
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:04,120
520 K and some companies even offered
upgrades up to two megabytes

696
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,529
own at sea

697
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:11,840
it also graphics resolution of 640 by

698
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,340
255 has a

699
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:20,280
and it was actually could do that you
know that bouncing ball demo

700
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,320
she appears that the media could do it
much higher

701
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:28,090
resolutions in fact it outperforms you
need an online thinks

702
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:31,760
even know the meat is consider the first

703
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,840
multimedia platform

704
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,250
I don't agree I think the cover three
was on

705
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,910
another fascinating about it was a great
BBS machine

706
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,910
you can run with Coco 3

707
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:48,190
iNOS night with ocean I need to run Tues

708
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,640
to lie to get three callers kid points1

709
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,859
one local and a I

710
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,220
this I saw could still run tasks at the
same time

711
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,790
even if they the people on the PBS for
accessing files and things like that she

712
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,230
can run a lot on it will

713
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:08,050
machine own

714
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:11,620
yet so I

715
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:15,100
personally I have a four eight-six I

716
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,550
I find that my Motorola which is
something at one point

717
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:24,250
987 megahertz or something like that is
smoother and faster

718
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:28,080
taking the same workload proportionally

719
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,650
because my when you

720
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,950
tight on this you can take

721
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:39,440
get no delay but when you type 486 your
386 something like that

722
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,550
fish there something stinky about it and
it's why I really hate those chips

723
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:48,580
and I think unfortunately

724
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:53,910
moral chips more expensive the cocoa did
not get very popular it's kind of gotten

725
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:58,790
revolution that I think it the cocoa had
been used

726
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:02,380
they had become more popular I think we
have a much different computing world I

727
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,690
think there'll be more understanding

728
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:08,490
technology because I mean they give it a
home computer you can at

729
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:12,150
a look at your TV as a unix-based
operating system

730
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:15,930
that and imagine what that would be like
today

731
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,560
everything's running like that I think
the environment

732
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,240
technology will be slightly different
more open things like that

733
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,510
on yes so I'm gonna

734
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:32,960
cut very short and going to graphics

735
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,369
its

736
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,000
okay %uh since we're short on time

737
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,450
I'm of China PMI summarize mine um

738
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:48,230
acquiring the machines almost time as we
were he said

739
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:52,570
you can funding really cheap I'll much
my machines I I use your car

740
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:57,560
free I'll my Apple to and my able to GS
is I got them from my school he learned

741
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,140
from way

742
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:02,230
so just ask around are usually family
member

743
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:06,560
friends for school or even workplace
they tend to have machines at the

744
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,690
having a closet that's going to go away
arm

745
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:13,240
you can also just checking local key
markets or here fests

746
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,920
n if you let him pass sometimes you find
machines that have already been modified

747
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,670
I'll you can check goodwill but usually
they tend to be older more pricey

748
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:27,770
in restoring the machines that's fairly
simple

749
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:31,990
because since you can free you pry don't
have to be storage get another one

750
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:35,830
by misuse way to go about but I mean if
you like

751
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:39,210
messing with the hardware you can
pipeline one

752
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:42,970
one boy has something of the night with
another and you might be able to swap

753
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,130
something up

754
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:48,450
arm the versatility of the machines

755
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:52,089
you can so do a lot of stuff there with
them are bought more systems

756
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:57,060
evening dollop and there's even there's
even a project with the Commodore 64

757
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,310
where when the clock radio with

758
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:06,359
a clinics a box and you can have a
taquito net

759
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:10,460
you could tell NAT into color 64 rain
BBS software

760
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,839
arm you can so use the

761
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,119
congress for the Amigo or whatever you
on the Internet

762
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,380
if is not TCPIP already 48

763
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,060
you can just basically find an ISP if
you're lucky in your area

764
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,799
allows shell dollop and then you can
just use

765
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,920
the unix/linux with PBST whatever
they're using you can use that

766
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,490
show from there arm and

767
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:41,200
sometimes you can find things to do with
machines that you didn't really think

768
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,339
didn't come out ahead all

769
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:47,599
at the last year as I picked up a whole
bunch 8088 with

770
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,290
no 24 bought modems and

771
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:55,690
museum house various things aren't dumb
terminals

772
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,170
by monkeys turns to keep recipes online
I mean

773
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:03,280
basically can you get bored enough
define interesting things you can do it

774
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,130
or machines

775
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:10,830
arm yeah

776
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:14,330
so basically I mean while you think
mostly she

777
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:17,630
issue I have the snow 66 you know

778
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:21,109
600 megahertz 26 makes ran

779
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:24,400
you know what I want to do with an old
college for me go or

780
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,480
Coco um there's a lot of enjoyment in
the older machines

781
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,910
I mean there's something about them
because we have so much to go on G

782
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,060
behind us today

783
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,420
that shouldn't these aren't as
impressive yet to I mean when you think

784
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:37,900
about

785
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,980
when they started out computers

786
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,280
they were for the company's the big guys
and

787
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,330
to be a burden have a computer in your
home that

788
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:50,400
you almost everything at the big
machines could do

789
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,400
that was pretty impressive and if you
are Linux or Unix tan

790
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,290
I'm not sure about the attention span of
the congress when isn't quite long x

791
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:05,140
arm it's basically a you expand

792
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:08,240
become a 6-4 did you have the two
triangles

793
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,619
and be sweet split screen wanna top one
bottom all

794
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:17,170
yeah me with that we haven't

795
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:20,540
user okay of this year

796
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:27,540
Q&A ok alright

797
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:34,869
so if anyone has any questions they can
line up for up

798
00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:41,700
you there K repeat that please

799
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,250
me Maxwell

800
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:50,700
I don't know that is your problem I have
following I am

801
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:55,260
music I have no idea

802
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:59,130
I I was like 65 tenn.-based or or what

803
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:04,500
by Weezer real

804
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:09,300
all I don't believe whatever

805
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,900
that that that's from the said things
about I will community is that

806
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,810
we we tend to be kinda vino centered on
a wrongful conduct in our inner turbine

807
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,400
where what's going on overseas

808
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,850
out briefly I comer 64 is considered
business class between germany

809
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:28,000
IBM's your head hideously expensive so
rapid tunes but cameras were cheap

810
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,359
so it was not uncommon to see a
Commodore 64 sitting on an executive's

811
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:32,130
desk

812
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,290
and the hackers in Europe decided they
wanted to do things

813
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:38,970
and when the really cool hacks was as a
graphic scanner for the Commodore

814
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:42,030
you know it works it will scan

815
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:46,400
graphics helped one big black and white
but it doesn't

816
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,500
a midsummer for the capital in the same
thing

817
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,670
and even at all see after the Apple to
use the hand scanner think

818
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:56,900
back up

819
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:01,670
your re:

820
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:04,740
on

821
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,190
gravy she is right against

822
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:14,350
crazy really the local atari guy who has
BBS when asap please on itself

823
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:18,089
my intention limited at Taree I here

824
00:51:18,089 --> 00:51:25,040
play day re:

825
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,050
up in mid-may in the air

826
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:31,500
I think I think ima yet they making
sense a

827
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,609
thre was superior in any way I sent

828
00:51:34,609 --> 00:51:39,770
but true by I don't think it's on the
more business applications it was

829
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:43,810
as good as the c64 from I think one
thing interesting the Tories are members

830
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,930
at 400 model in eight hundred model

831
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:50,170
any theory actually came out with 12 or
16 are modeled using more sophisticated

832
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:53,570
in I think the big problem is marking in
time yeah I

833
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:57,910
generation that became a leading nice
product they're always maybe six months

834
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:59,140
to 15 months

835
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:03,230
there right then what would have been
his I will get early market entry

836
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:07,000
to to getting up base where the games
that is in the business at

837
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,330
that into it rent I want the problem was
looking for was whistled and toys R Us

838
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:16,960
period and it was considered a toy
computer

839
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:23,960
you there

840
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:30,040
i've heard rumors about that and I

841
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,210
I'm not even sure I think I know just
very as much as you but

842
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:36,550
I know that there were some rumors are
providing the Amiga

843
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:40,400
I think what they're going to do is put
smacking me go on and have a

844
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,890
a PC that run some shorter windows like
operating system I don't think it's

845
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:46,319
going to be truly in Amita

846
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:50,470
one thing that they can mention very
briefly is a duet any leaders now for

847
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:53,650
example for IBM PC platforms and brother
but want to see me

848
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:56,720
almost any these old machine oh yes if
you want to meet Apple to

849
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,340
too close to E he got modulo delusional
all what were the wrong she

850
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,830
and you can do Apple to close work on
your lap to app lets

851
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,630
a just about not Apple is being rolled
out just fine

852
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:12,700
money PT class machine I Chinese before
making this is actually gonna help

853
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:19,700
beechwood revival using retro here it
did

854
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,280
here

855
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,839
okay the the starting point for any in
this is on Usenet comp sys

856
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:50,720
CBM I'll that is the final ball coming
to our knowledge there people on there

857
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,770
that no more about the common or then
got himself

858
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:58,099
because they built the damn things are
Fred Bowen a an engineer

859
00:53:58,099 --> 00:54:01,480
is frequently and here comes the CBM

860
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,619
I'll swallow sure the people from the
good ol days a Commodore are from there

861
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:06,480
you can get

862
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:12,480
%um you can buy manuals ya the place
over in Finland that has just hines of

863
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,349
stuff available for download

864
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:18,690
I so if you if you want to start comes
the CBMs

865
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:22,079
which begin I think we're good to go
over actually

866
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,250
I had model comic books I have up over
there

867
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:29,210
has command X and also cuz you all the
great things in all did you can come get

868
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:29,490
a

869
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:34,980
you can happen so scouting gonna take a
look at all

870
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,980
we're going to take one more question
got a hacker ethic man

871
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:44,980
IBM up action of the idea

872
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:58,400
oh I'm idea

873
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:04,130
injured planet especially large coke I
and II any any search engine Yahoo again

874
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,410
comes a CBM

875
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:09,269
I and they're all downloadable I think

876
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:12,960
camp and you got or Garcon think I was
one they have pretty much

877
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,059
any emulator you anything machine E Coco
emulators they come

878
00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:22,019
usually Coco to me. lawyers I have yet
to find a freeware called 13 emulator

879
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:23,049
unfortunately

880
00:55:23,049 --> 00:55:26,900

881
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,049
plenty of places quiet me demolition
software like that a lot of games

882
00:55:31,049 --> 00:55:32,920
