5
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:58,930
I very

6
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,530
on this is the a legal panel because
we're in legal trouble

7
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,940
and know we have a legal panel because
that

8
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,110
are so basically I'm we have rubbing
breasts and morning artists from mom

9
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,320
much I Frontier Foundation and from or
our legal foundation

10
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,320
in in order its

11
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,080
and we be in a hollow trouble if they
weren't here because we'd be

12
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,300
getting sued by the MPAA with nobody to
defend us aren't so basically

13
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,710
this panel is to update you on that
situation

14
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,530
as well as other situations in that are
related in

15
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,450
the hacker world in are in a community
so are basically I'm gonna head over to

16
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,670
not to run for Santa morning to study
people on where the case stands now why

17
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,990
the case is important and will take
questions as well

18
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,600
I guess I settled himself I

19
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,760
Electronic Frontier Foundation felt
really compelled to get involved in this

20
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,450
case

21
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,070
when it was first filed and the reason
for that is obvious

22
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,720
our first amendment right our civil
liberties are

23
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,970
attempted to be wheeled away here with
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in

24
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:14,980
particular this

25
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,420
very narrow interpretation of it and
shell

26
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,410
what we're here for is to ensure that
the same rights

27
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,380
that we enjoy into traditional space the
first amendment fair use

28
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,810
reverse engineering things like that
we'll continue to have

29
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,590
benefit up in the electronic ground
swell since

30
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,410
that is where we're all headed whether
we know it or not and so

31
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,500
dad is why just we took on this case and

32
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,330
in our ten years up defending civil
liberties on the net this is by far the

33
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,190
biggest and most expensive project that
we have ever

34
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,370
faced so I'm gonna happen didn't do my
shameless membership like here

35
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,410
and encourage you all to lead with you
all to join the Electronic Frontier

36
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,470
Foundation

37
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,620
and donate money to the cause because
this is very important

38
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,670
and this isn't just about Emmanuel
Goldstein this is about all of us these

39
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,260
are our rights that we all rely

40
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,069
planning will need he was to start it
wanted the first exercise in this way

41
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:17,150
just a sacrificial lamb shift so we got
a booth set up

42
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,550
out in the exhibition area and we've got
materials

43
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,300
lot more information and you can join
their you can also join our website

44
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,590
and again please do join because this is
a very important case

45
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,790
and its it's incredibly expensive were
up against

46
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,010
billions and they're fighting for their
lifestyle

47
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,899
they're using it morning darkness has
defended people

48
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,800
I'll threats such as Spike Lee and Lenny
Bruce alcanza

49
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,250
call people that the defending a one
point or another are so I'm

50
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,989
I'm very happy and proud to be partners
are part of his his

51
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:55,220
list of clients arm morning only be here
for the first half hour this panel saw

52
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,459
gonna give you every chance to add to
speak to the importance this case and

53
00:03:58,459 --> 00:03:59,720
answer any questions you might have

54
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,180
about two dozen that my murder clients
for excuse all

55
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,250
okay by should have told you that

56
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,380
hungry by

57
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,600
yes unlikely but not out of the question

58
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,010
i fix %uh the trial starts on Monday

59
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,950
the trial is one of the most important
cases

60
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,900
that will be tried for a long period of
time although it

61
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,850
relates to DVD's it relates to form one
it relates to the right

62
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,160
of a journalist manual goals me

63
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,850
a hacker quarterly and

64
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,200
a website to report on an incident in a
way that it sees fit

65
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,310
it relates to his right to say what he
wants to say

66
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,580
about the CSS hacking it relates to his
right to say what he wants to say that

67
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,150
the open source community

68
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,030
it relates to his right to say what he
wants to talk about the monopoly power

69
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,470
%uh Microsoft or any other social issues

70
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,040
so that's one part in the case which is
very separate

71
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,640
from other course second port which is
significant is that

72
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,729
manual course these defended and it is
not an axe

73
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,310
that you have one defendant in the new
york Southern District

74
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,110
and you have nine movie studios allied
against that

75
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,590
send it the fact that he looks like a
manual ghosting talks like Emmanuel

76
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,360
Goldstein

77
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,410
and looks like I'm a little steam is one
of the reasons he is defending this case

78
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,340
where he does exactly in his quarterly
is with the new york times does when we

79
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,650
first stories

80
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,669
and we first other hand other sites

81
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:47,909
that nearly the CSS San Jose Mercury
News

82
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,070
has come in on site is manual calls

83
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,729
in this case the New York Times has
filed an affidavit

84
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,120
in this case or manual steam

85
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,220
at some preliminary hearings
times-mirror in the village voice

86
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,290
came inside manuals the so its
recognition

87
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:11,750
up the very substantial and complex
issues involved in this case

88
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,280
the third significant thing again and
not to denigrate DVD's was not about the

89
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,039
DVD's

90
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,200
it's about how you will communicate in
the future

91
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,740
the DVD format the encryption for metal
relate

92
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,979
books movies audio absolutely everything
so what happens he will determine

93
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,690
Hanau the new technologies will adopt
and how they will adapt to the law

94
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,419
in what you can and can't do can you for
example

95
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:41,479
if you wanted to do filme let's say

96
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:45,080
what do a classroom lecture on kevin
Mitnick

97
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,840
could you take two minutes at every DVD

98
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,419
and use that assuming main goals is
wonderful movie

99
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:56,549
ultimately becomes a smashing commercial
success

100
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,960
along the line is Star Wars and people
then I went to

101
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,120
n/a people want not the last one yeah

102
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,120
you should know the main goal seen
already has toys gadgets & calendars

103
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,090
is being developed with respect to the
movie in any event

104
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,849
can you with respect to the kevin
Mitnick movie

105
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:24,360
was Star Wars or the schindler's list
can you walk into a classroom making the

106
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,729
teachers say I want to take a minute to

107
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:30,590
added this DVD because I want to teach
my class about

108
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,840
under the interpretation movie studios
have this law you cannot

109
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,950
can use to your child or your friend

110
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,640
go into a classroom make presentations
and say I want to take two minutes

111
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,490
out schindler's list kevin Mitnick film
whatever gone with the wind

112
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,550
to show you something about sale
something about america something about

113
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,110
anything

114
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,669
the answers you cannot can a librarian

115
00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:00,250
take people railed in the librarian said
listen I want to show you something that

116
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,690
excites me the book

117
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:07,080
or from a DVD or something else and the
answer is if they interpret the DMC the

118
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,240
way they intend to the

119
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,900
turbidity you cannot now for the last
two hundred years in this country have a

120
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,650
constitution which still exists

121
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,990
which talks about a copyright right
namely people have the right

122
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,130
two-out make money and do things for the
levers

123
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,289
menu has something called First
Amendment free speech and for the first

124
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:28,370
time because this technology

125
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:34,089
the copyright holders his so it and the
whole sphere use concept which Robin can

126
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,729
talk to a great great lengths

127
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:38,810
is one of the most important ports

128
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,640
the first amendment so I think that with
this case does

129
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,990
it presents a multitude of issues the
expectation is on Monday when we start

130
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,980
trial

131
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,920
because judge Kaplan has already
rendered his view of the case

132
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,990
this is a case frankly the could be
tried in 12 minutes

133
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,270
given his you the case he has agreed to
allow us to make a

134
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,310
appellate record a more substantial
trial

135
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,830
ultimately this case will be one in the
2nd circuit

136
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,350
in the court of appeals it will not be
long before judge caplan

137
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,230
unless I'm very unless I'm wrong and
unless he's far more flexible I believe

138
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,150
he is

139
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,779
he battered the hell out of dropping
grows

140
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:26,510
who appear the first time in january 13
twitchy store to stop have an injunction

141
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,819
imposed

142
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,770
on Emmanuel goals be he made his bias is
very very clear

143
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,380
he refused to allow Robin to make an
argument he refused to allow rotten to

144
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,510
put documents into evidence

145
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,230
so it is very clear that he perceives
that this is a case for copyright

146
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,300
holders

147
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,339
or threatened very seriously he now
understands

148
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,440
what he did not understand when he was
yelling

149
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,890
and Robin grows that there have been no
downloads to the DCSS

150
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,350
it that has been no pirate downloads
people's looked at it

151
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,970
but there has been no piracy a and that
it is a fair use utility

152
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,540
coming in on side main goals the you saw
it

153
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,839
times Mary various newspapers or centers
from

154
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,080
berkeley Horford and other places in all
this stuff is up on the net

155
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,930
by their own Emmanuel Goldstein site on
s fork

156
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,029
Robin grosses site see you can see
exactly what's going on you can see

157
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:31,230
decisions you can follow it it's in a
way the first internet trial

158
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,020
is you know federal in the federal
courts cameras kicking in

159
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,810
but the internet it's in so so the stuff
that goes there

160
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,230
so you can watch the trial as it unfolds

161
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,410
on the Internet on the site's both mani

162
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,980
and problem grossed site

163
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,330
do you have any questions

164
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:59,110
home first laws like to say I do have
the 12-inch main local teen rape recall

165
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,850
so secondly has spent many many hours
poring over the documents have been put

166
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:05,750
up on that

167
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,149
on a sitter website they're fascinating
yes

168
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:13,180
they are I am in fact my my mother came

169
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,050
down one day and the she said shizzle
what have you

170
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,210
you've been doing that's meant hang up
the phone lines

171
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,710
daisies days been reading all these
documents aired

172
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,300
actually passing my question however is
at because it I

173
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,930
after reading over these documents I'm
wondering the what the hell are these

174
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,730
people even doing in court

175
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,480
because they get up there on the stand
the cold I don't know

176
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,700
absolutely not I haven't seen any in
this I don't know anything

177
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,920
I don't know I don't know the consulate
here saying they don't know

178
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,279
what is this case still doing in court
do you referring to the jack valenti

179
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,790
testimony I SM

180
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,699
will not just that but it seems like
everyone who's ever testifies as

181
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,730
all I don't know anytime that

182
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,730
a person has turned a movie yes you a

183
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:02,390
fuel bowl thing and download it I don't
know anybody who's who is done did I

184
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,120
haven't seen anything about it

185
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,420
have very many if you read the documents
in 2010

186
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,939
good stats that impresses Tom well

187
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,709
I think it's very relevant house using
unusual how many view here had ever

188
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:18,930
used the ECSS

189
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,470
how many you here as ever succeeded

190
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,290
in through the use if the CS the
encrypting

191
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,680
went looking at a DVD movie

192
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,970
how many one person how many how many
people before he tried it let me say

193
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,990
for help people couldn't get it to work
so in other words about one

194
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,670
what had a is grossly about one-eighth
25-30 was able to make it work is a

195
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,670
right

196
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:51,700
and what happened to you free sample you
try it

197
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,100
him anybody

198
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,290
you'd make this make like a a pirate

199
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,439
video like you know DVD anything like
that you did

200
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,640
which it you very much

201
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:11,640
scratch we mean you write it

202
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,240
me rewrote the CSS Wow domestic really
legal

203
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,740
the its

204
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,269
analyze the MPAA gonna come after I
wrote the CSS issue

205
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:28,829
arrest that man let me ask you this

206
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:34,250
with so I it

207
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,920
that strip it's Joe

208
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,920
me

209
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:45,780
well

210
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:50,280
so i i think maybe a some history is in
order to some people have a sense a case

211
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,390
there are people here don't know the
actual history a how things came about

212
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,020
base this all started back in was in
November

213
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:01,120
where r I some sites had posted the CSS
code

214
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,490
and that the CSS code was went down

215
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,240
defeated CSS I CSS is

216
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,290
running crips DVD's and it's not for
copying uses for playback control

217
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,120
it's what tells your DVD not your DVD
player not to play something from say

218
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,650
europe

219
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:23,199
I it tells your DVD player not to skip
commercials at the beginning of the DVD

220
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,550
that that you may rent restore are and
also since

221
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:30,390
people have Linux machine status they
didn't sign the copyright agreement or

222
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,760
whatever and pay millions dollars

223
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,480
there is no way without DCSS to actually
play DVD analytic system that's

224
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,050
there was the main reason for trying to
figure out a way to

225
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,000
make this work clinics so some people
figure this out they posted the code

226
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,560
and all the sudden they started getting
threatened and harassed by the DVD CCAA

227
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,540
the MPAA

228
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,709
and we watching both these develop its
first ball

229
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,720
d the cracking CSS was an interesting
story

230
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,220
but then the intimidation after that was
a fascinating story that people can

231
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,930
actually be

232
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,990
intimidated into taking down website to
being kicked off the net

233
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,140
simply for publishing source code that I

234
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,520
you know what wasn't even a copyright
infringement because the person who

235
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,360
public who wrote the source called
that's only person I can say take it

236
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,290
down my eyes

237
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,980
so basically we thought that was an
interesting story we put up on our site

238
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,490
we put a link to the to the at source
code

239
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,240
and with its worst on our site and that
turned us into the problem

240
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,910
in the eyes the MPAA the next thing
happened was they came after us

241
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,290
and brought us to court so I just I find
the whole thing incredibly scary

242
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,689
how all the sudden simply by linking to
something

243
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,710
that we didn't even write just analyzing
a program

244
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,940
all the sudden we're being dragged into
federal court and it's something that

245
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,280
you really can't let stand

246
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,470
doing everything right here in the fax a

247
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,530
overlooked at glad

248
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,560
Sep 10 ani: every hearing that a
suggestion plead guilty

249
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,730
okay enemy the state

250
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,350
the speak into the mic

251
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,470
I have a cursory knowledge the issues
except from what was just said

252
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,800
and accepting what might sign tells me
by

253
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,880
one thing that occurs to me is s15 is
too old to

254
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,780
at this point really hellish Seok what
hands

255
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,920
my is the intent of publishing

256
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,250
if you see a get the intent

257
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,740
of publishing hold West share from

258
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,280
then can't be right more the intent

259
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,350
in my mind that dat can still violation
law

260
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,140
haha I think critical is proving what
the intent lost

261
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,210
EU published poll on your website

262
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,640
and the sole purpose of publishing neck
called

263
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,270
is T E be used to circumvent a law

264
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,840
and in my mind that almost

265
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,790
text t2 conspiracy yet you he at
eighteen years my

266
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,710
any in Ft people getting anything we're
gonna he get

267
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,110
we're gonna and looking at the site
through this K

268
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,209
and and put it at market to enable

269
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:11,980
small harpist enabling I think people to
circumvent

270
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,610
copyright law the region just if I can't
exactly

271
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,550
we have it relevant to the deposition
now when most dangerous than Al

272
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,079
I'll just spahn to it when most
dangerous things in law

273
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,319
whether it be this or political cases
who would ever

274
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,730
is to establish liability on the basis
content

275
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,220
because if you establish liability on
the basis attend

276
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,150
forgetting about what happens than what
it really means is somebody is deciding

277
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,120
what is your mind when you did something
without also really means to diverge

278
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,570
if it's a judge or jury that they can
decide anything

279
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,139
that they want you about what's in your
mind now

280
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:55,230
with respect to this particular case
decs was developed by people who were

281
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,090
interested

282
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:01,209
in creating a Linux operating base
system that would allow for the playing

283
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,190
those DVD's on that system

284
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,310
the way the lawn now functions and also
be very very brief

285
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,629
the DVD Control Association has a
license

286
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,550
they give that license to Universal
Pictures Universal Pictures makes it

287
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,370
makes movie

288
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:22,220
which the input on a DVD another company
that takes that impresses that DVD

289
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,920
and then it is ultimately played let's
say in a Panasonic machine

290
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,930
cetera et cetera so which is then head

291
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:33,390
the very anxious mean which is enhanced

292
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,790
is a closed system with respect to who
can play

293
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,470
that DVD enough if someone has a Linux
operating system

294
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,620
he goes out an open sewer system egos at
he pays $25 dollars

295
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:52,070
he PE is the DVD company with a want
list entitled to health

296
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:58,010
and any that plays on his machine now if
we're talking about is protection DVD

297
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:02,420
if we're talking about a competitive
system initiate the other companies

298
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,600
other than those that rely senses tool
on that has always been

299
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,070
absolutely clear happen Opole issues

300
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:14,320
you have control issues question is
whether DMCA

301
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,450
has changed a law that's an issue to be
decided in this case

302
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,510
yeah I kick in this case of sensed
something leave

303
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:27,290
that I think with the other gentleman
said that is your intent to pirate is

304
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,850
intent to do this

305
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,060
are you trying to given the new
technologies

306
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,480
just push button on a DVD and then

307
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,880
if not today but three years from now
have four million people get a DVD for

308
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,030
nothing

309
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,820
that's an issue what that has to be
discussed it has to be discussed

310
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,530
in a complicated sophisticated way
that's not this case

311
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,570
and no one says he is issues

312
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,720
you know one's know if the you see

313
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,480
sea-change happening here in that for so
long that

314
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,680
in the hacker community has been looked
at on the fringe

315
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,850
years ago manual got all that to

316
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,540
at Marquee any procedure to you know
within the new one

317
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,060
I very and justly and fairly but now

318
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,830
wish the maybe the MPAA thought they
could come in and they could scare

319
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,580
calling

320
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,699
a bunch of little kids and push them
around is there

321
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,790
a sea change happening here you think
that

322
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:31,120
with this suit going for Nicholas it has
that corporate America

323
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,490
is going to think twice about you just
kinda scattershot trying to

324
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,990
to scare people off the well let me
answer in this my last personally

325
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,910
a man you mention something the other
people I had represented

326
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:48,360
inline mic point better Lenny Bruce
Henry Miller DH lawrence woodham

327
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,500
these are key galesburg these people who
were headed the culture

328
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,720
these are people who are outside the
culture he's a people who s certain said

329
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,220
its social values

330
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,310
history has proven with respective
nearly all these iconoclastic eclectic

331
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,290
people

332
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,930
that they were right and that's where
the culture was gone Emmanuel Goldstein

333
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,840
stance on the issues

334
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,360
and so what you have here is a culture
clash between

335
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,840
KS and where it's going the OPP the the
optimistic the question you're asking

336
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,740
someone optimistically

337
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,140
is is this going to change anything how
is it going to change anything what's

338
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,110
going to happen

339
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:29,150
congress is is is influenced two ways
either by money which was the people in

340
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,490
this room don't have

341
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,840
or certainly not in the way the movie
studios have it

342
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,330
or with respect to votes to the extent
that this case

343
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,500
whether it wins or loses becomes a
public issue

344
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,320
and people focus on it it becomes
extraordinarily important

345
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,679
this is a case the requires community
involvement

346
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,290
the next the case is easy people
understand it this case kinda gets lost

347
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,790
it could conceivably be something like
the current flight case

348
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,399
a case that's lost but then least
dramatic changes

349
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,040
his people realize that it's inequitable

350
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,379
thank you one thing I would add to that

351
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,370
is in many ways large corporations can
look at the situation right now and

352
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,240
think that it's

353
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,400
it filing a preliminary injunction a

354
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,240
request is it was really good thing
really good way to get what you need

355
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:27,240
in his case as I think morning for
coming to take TriMet its

356
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,600
he's actually heading back now to deal
with another deposition in this case is

357
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,320
going right down to the wire sets

358
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,450
unbelievable amount of work silent yes
but what I was saying is that

359
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:49,870
in this case and in the California case
we had DVD CA we had the motion picture

360
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,630
industry just rushing into court

361
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:55,420
and you know trying to sell the court to
spill into riots in which they got an

362
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,470
injunction issued immediately and it's
been months now and

363
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,660
speech has been squelched on the net as
a result

364
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,080
a bit and so in many ways I think that
the current situation looks

365
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,360
tiny good and some ways for large
corporations because they've been

366
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,250
successful

367
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,300
and getting this preliminary injunction
against the defendants

368
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,670
that's fine quick question

369
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,820
how similar is this case to some the
encryption export cases like burns

370
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,870
in another's free speech was in fact the
issue

371
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,200
and the exiting the MPAA with the US
government

372
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,250
involves for Sprint spots that speech
yep that's a really good question

373
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,490
because these cases

374
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:37,190
is really a direct cousin if you will to
a different scene case

375
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:41,060
in that that that's the case in case
you're not familiar that the effect

376
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,909
sponsored in the mid 90's

377
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:48,200
on where AP encryption professor wanted
to put in corruption code on its website

378
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,960
Andy

379
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,810
the administration came down against him

380
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,350
and staying that encryption is a
munitions control and there needs to be

381
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,110
export

382
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,880
controls on them and so he by his
posting disco to the website he was

383
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,830
violating the explain caption controls

384
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,280
and the Electronic Frontier Foundation
sponsored that case is well

385
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,139
arguing that computer code is expressive
speech

386
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,680
worthy of protection under the First
Amendment and

387
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,210
last may the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals

388
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,350
upheld that ruling and

389
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,690
a few months ago the Sixth Circuit Court
of Appeals also

390
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,070
held at ruling as well and so where this
case comes in is

391
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,600
somewhat similar can DCSS is computer
code

392
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,350
it is expressive creative expression

393
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,560
and is worthy a first amendment
protection just like when you read the

394
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,419
newspaper

395
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,980
or a book or listen to me music it is a
creative expression where the first

396
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,960
amendment protection

397
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,680
and if you're going to bar some wine or
ban someone from distributing this

398
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,720
information this creative expression

399
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,210
there needs to be a First Amendment
analysis and

400
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,790
done up the situation and First
Amendment principles must

401
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:05,220
come into play think we got here with
this case

402
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,470
is America often thinks own since that
whereas

403
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,490
this the CSS was written by Norwegian

404
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,560
because the MPAA Congo after

405
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,230
dispersed write the code they're just
going off to everyone who plays

406
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:23,330
up on on the instep in america but they
did manage to get somebody in no way

407
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,179
arrested

408
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,190
yeah I know impressionist next

409
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:32,240
today police here today cash anything
here that we just don't tell the fed

410
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,090
slash

411
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:37,540
John Johansen and his father pair were
both indicted in Norway

412
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,940
for company's computer code on the web
and

413
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,160
the motion picture industry is going
after them very strongly there

414
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,170
and they've recently filed a motion to

415
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,690
add me on as a named defendant to the
California case

416
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:55,430
and as a couple days ago they had sent
him a notice to deposition subpoena

417
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,290
in that case is well going to question
printing

418
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:04,450
I think it's also important to note
though that we

419
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:07,850
have but much like your new york in
Norway we've hired

420
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,360
some in the Best Lawyers over there have
an excellent track record against the

421
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,990
Norwegian Economic Crime Unit

422
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,160
and so they're representing Yunnan and
his father there's

423
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,130
II to just a touch on the point Ansmann
mentioned earlier that

424
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,250
intent on and I think you can you can
pretty much gauge our intent by just

425
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,310
looking at our history

426
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:31,300
are we did not publish were put up the
CSS code on our site

427
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,650
with the intent circumventing any
particular

428
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,250
Copyright Act we put up because
information and as we've been doing

429
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,120
since 1984 is publishing information

430
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,840
are what is done with the information
after we publish it that's

431
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,790
you know it it's not under our control
are but we believe that by putting it

432
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,520
out there before

433
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,129
one thing we're talking about something
which I'm gonna fiction that got

434
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:51,660
defeated

435
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,030
what is the point have not telling
people about that was the point of

436
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,090
having bad encryption out there that's
been completely compromised

437
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:01,730
and then pretending it didn't happen man
at I have to wonder when these people

438
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,400
thinking

439
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,770
so obviously by putting up there where
we actually helping them to develop

440
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,050
something a little bit better next time
maybe

441
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:12,159
for the open source community you know
when they start developing things so

442
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,880
that day

443
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:19,880
we won't be you know torn apart by
somebody in kindergarten she

444
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,690
in response what you said about unions
being added to the help when he's isn't

445
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,540
there yet

446
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:32,330
big matter jurisdiction act there's a
huge managers dictionary

447
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,199
and I'm one of the defendants Matt
Pelech is actually filed

448
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,410
a motion to quash the Kate complaint
against him based on jurisdiction

449
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,730
and am I would encourage all the other
defendants named

450
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,110
I'm named defendants are outside the
court California to

451
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:51,220
also file similar paperwork eats well we
haven't

452
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,410
compare ruling yet on its motion to
quash bass singer's texan

453
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:58,300
but we expect one in a few weeks and E
if it's positive

454
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,840
i'd like church everyone who's an
independent to file similar people

455
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,800
working at themselves trapped on the
case

456
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,340
as the day goes on

457
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,510
at a question but my understanding is
that on Tuesday

458
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,150
and congressional committee orrin Hatch
people who brought the DMCA

459
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,340
heroes I V RIAA

460
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:25,230
and a satellite is being applied
inconsistent with the congressional

461
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,430
intent behind it

462
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,620
I was wondering if you feel that might
influence score and future

463
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,240
are our future courts and down also

464
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,800
he what links they might be between that

465
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,530
the hit the music issues under the DMCA
and at

466
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:43,889
MPAA issues well i think im they're very
much linked

467
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,980
on because the DMCA is is a tool

468
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,610
that the Recording Industry Association
of America MPAA

469
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,650
fight very hard they spent a lot of
money to buy an act and

470
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,220
ironically however day what they thought
they were getting

471
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:03,040
is is airway like this case is about is
what they thought they were getting and

472
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,780
not really what they actually got

473
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,320
there was a few there was a carve-out
for for fair use terrorist

474
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,110
specific language in the act asking to
protected first amendment

475
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:16,320
and their specific language protecting
reverse engineering computer security

476
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,490
encryption research the sort of thing
but what this case is about

477
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,510
is an attempt to even extend what they
did get

478
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,860
which was helluva lot to something even
more

479
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,480
more agree just and than that and I
think that's what the congress

480
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,150
for the Senators were expressing their
dislike for is the fact that now this

481
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,460
act is being tried

482
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,340
is try to use to extend even with the
DMCA granted them

483
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,300
I think a lot of people had the wall
pulled over their eyes as far as this

484
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,550
particular

485
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:49,350
act goes are when when the case was
first announced against us he probably

486
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,650
saw some

487
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,580
some some press that made it seem like
we're a bunch of pirates

488
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,320
and that jacqueline day was at the head
of the EPA was right there saying how

489
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,290
now we're out there basically ruining
the whole movie industry and

490
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:05,980
causing all kinds of damage by by doing
things like what we do it's funny

491
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,850
because it only goes up on the stand is
no idea who I am

492
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:14,010
and as a young teachers with his face
and that's all I did shop

493
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,800
you have to wonder who's really running
iOS press release one thing but that's

494
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,950
that's only one tiny part of the whole
point

495
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:23,410
I the the major issue is that they're
basically misleading people by making

496
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,050
this seem like it's

497
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:28,850
about copy and I think as as we've
demonstrated

498
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:32,570
over and over again it's not about
copying you can

499
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:36,040
you guys understand history most people
don't understand is people in the media

500
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,230
don't get it people on the street don't
get you have to explain it in very

501
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,230
carefully

502
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,520
but basically you have an infected file
any copy it

503
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,770
you can still be cryptic copy easy as
long as you have the critter and the

504
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:49,010
crib to exist in every DVD player

505
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:53,320
right simple right well that kinda thing
is is lost on the media

506
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,730
and they stink that by decreasing and
that means that we can simply copy it

507
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,130
and its

508
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,350
it makes no sense because decreasing it
doesn't make it any easier to copy

509
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,260
what it does do it allows you to bypass
things like a

510
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,129
the country restriction that forbid you
from watching a DVD in a different

511
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,410
country that allows you to

512
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,140
wash a DVD on a Linux machine bypassing
the access control their

513
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,340
it allows you to skip commercials
bypassing that access control

514
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,630
it's not about copies about this thing
called access control which is a fairly

515
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,720
new

516
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,820
typeof the tax concept when applied to

517
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:30,090
to consumer electronics for instance
imagine if you burn a CD in London you

518
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,400
want to play it here in the United
States because

519
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,950
well there's a restriction on it you
know it's these are restrictions that

520
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,670
we've never had before

521
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,730
and they're trying to make it seem like
that's part of what copyright is

522
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,530
and I think the reaction orrin Hatch
showed the other day

523
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:49,129
pretty much true that that's how they
met when they drafted this law that

524
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,160
you know they just pretty much hand
everything over to the Raad

525
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,260
the MPAA where they can pretty much
right out

526
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,020
rules how you play back things you've
already bought a mean

527
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,360
you bought a DVD player I signed up for
DVD on a Linux machine

528
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,430
yet you breaking the law to try to make
it to the work together same

529
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,590
yet they try to make this out like its
piracy like it

530
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,730
arm about copying and we have a hard
time explaining that it's not an

531
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:19,290
to one thing that we found this helpful
is to just tell people this is about

532
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,940
buying the DVD Terry watching the DVD
state you purchased

533
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,140
on the machines that you are home that's
essentially what this case

534
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,320
spell

535
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:35,050
immunity some people the BX get it okay
everybody to me is get it but

536
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:38,960
uphill battle area I'm Robin the
question I have for you is about access

537
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,480
control the think this

538
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,540
case look at broad and it all to make
attempts to

539
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:48,310
clear a discrete lot to make access
control elicit or

540
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:52,530
actually make it legal right now d it'll
turn around a little bit

541
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:56,700
I'm sorry dis all right now is the DNC a
mix at SAC

542
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,370
access control putting a fence around
something whether or not it's a legal

543
00:32:59,370 --> 00:32:59,980
use

544
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,260
up that me right now you know the fight
is not exactly but when you

545
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,870
I'm in your hood legal you see what he
was doing it's more that he

546
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,890
excuse me that John Johansson and the
people who create the

547
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,000
DCSS it's not about them

548
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,940
doing it for fair use necessarily it's
more the violated access control

549
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:24,150
well there's two parts to the DMCA are
relevant it to this discussion one is to

550
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:27,550
the prohibition against the active
circumvention I think that's what you're

551
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,399
talking about

552
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,550
and the second is and what this case is
about which is the prague

553
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:36,240
mission against distributing tools that
can be used to circumvent

554
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,290
and am it's important that the first

555
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:43,379
provisioning the prohibition against the
act as a convention has not yet gone

556
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,250
into effect

557
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:48,420
so it's not illegal to use DCSS for
Kerry's purposes are

558
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:52,660
any other legitimate purposes and budget
revision against distributing

559
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,180
tools that can be used for I
circumvention

560
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,190
that went into effect immediately on now
the Copyright Office is currently

561
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:04,350
going to a rulemaking provisions a study
whereby there trying to determine

562
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,130
whether or not particular

563
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:09,730
a class is it works will be adversely
impacted by the prohibition against the

564
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,070
active circumvention

565
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:15,490
and day will be issuing some rulings as
to whether or not their classes

566
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:19,110
works that will be exempt from that
prohibition and they'll make that

567
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,740
announcement October 28

568
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:25,379
currently going in it going to study I'm
what the Electronic Frontier Foundation

569
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:26,149
has

570
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:30,918
requested again is that the exact DVD's
protected by CSS

571
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:34,489
from the prohibition against the active
circumvention

572
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:38,780
and essentially people be completely
denied their fair use right

573
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,730
if DCSS is not allowed to I'd be
distributed

574
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,740
and people are not allowed to use DCSS
to circumvent

575
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:51,879
DVD's isn't that it though putting the
issue of a little bit I mean

576
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:56,179
precinct gonna have STM Iowa for music
answering have another access control

577
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,279
technology there

578
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,670
I'm area cable boxes people circumvent
so the question is a circumvention

579
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,090
against fair use itself I mean is there

580
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:09,440
is there a problem there that you see
his

581
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,480
future yes I mean it's it's an
incredible problem you just mentioned as

582
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,250
TMI

583
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:18,390
and imagine if Sony decide that in order
to you

584
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,609
listening to Sony Music you have to
purchase a Sony

585
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:27,550
I audio device and ebbe don't want one
of those are you got something else

586
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,560
and you need you may need to circumvent
the

587
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,290
protection to do that recording

588
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,550
in order to get it to work with whatever
system that you're using

589
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:42,590
and so it's this same issue what happens
in this case will directly relate to

590
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,180
what happens

591
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:47,660
St mine whether or not people have fair
use rights to use their music to use

592
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,730
books and it's it's much broader than
movies on

593
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:55,000
just as a technical question they're
actually as is my

594
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,510
saying it there's two parts the country
code is actually separate from the CSS

595
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:03,150
encryption authorization said you can
authorize the country code

596
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,650
without having to do to deal with the
CSS

597
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,830
make get it an offer a CSS other than

598
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:13,410
that you you say you could actually said
it the country code everyone

599
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:17,359
isn't that I mean to the country codes
are separate issue

600
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,450
it's that the CSS the actual encryption
key

601
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,460
eek the key the algorithm is what
they're using

602
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,040
to you know as their business prop and
that this

603
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,370
feel within america and then outside

604
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,870
deal Clark across the globe it's country
codes that are separate thing

605
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:38,799
it's their separate the they actually
sticking a separate tragic a separate

606
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,420
CSS

607
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,540
there there's a separate from my
understanding that there's a separate

608
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,120
like there's the the country code the
region code by

609
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,380
and then thats then there's something
else

610
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,130
and then there's the DCSS key this css
key

611
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:59,400
and that the algorithms are independent
my understanding is is related to CSS I

612
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,410
could be wrong on that

613
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,549
I have pain I don't know that much about
the CSS thing about this goal we did was

614
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,120
we

615
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,140
his pecs code yes

616
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,870
you know what that does make it a whirl
easiest is not do it is not make

617
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:16,560
topping any easier that that's not the
question I

618
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,140
that's that's what that's my extensive
knowledge as to as to what the CSS

619
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:20,850
actually

620
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:25,490
accomplishes I'm I've been told that it
also accomplishes

621
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,840
defeating region coding that stature
than my

622
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,840
that as well you that that's a question
I don't know

623
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,980
at UMass is there a panel on and

624
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,670
dcfs later there is a and I i believe me
technical issues

625
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:43,080
me on that one well most people so there
may be more information about to the

626
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,990
technical

627
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:48,740
issues behind the technology and okay

628
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,690
I have two questions for stuff playing
from what I understand

629
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:57,330
real left a key and click a CSS key
encrypt it in there seeing

630
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:01,850
DVD player has there been any richard
has the MPAA

631
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:05,420
Kate taking action against real meeting
that he included

632
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,930
not that I'm aware I did sing lost a
license

633
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:12,850
who was doing the things things lol
their own by religion

634
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:17,710
me yes cash and say that very often
night

635
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,720
I think I think they lost a license and
a clash

636
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,800
family yet my question is there's

637
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,020
my understand there are programs that
you just take the DVD

638
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:30,250
outplayed and getting plenty of I'll be
forced

639
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:34,180
brush their video card happen there's no
action taken against the opposite this

640
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,710
program but I think when the response of
DVD

641
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:40,320
air going on he got paid an hour into a
filed today

642
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:47,320
like hiring later is happens to act
against those people

643
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,160
when there's no I this is because I
don't think copying is the issue I don't

644
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,720
think they really care that much by
copying I think they're more concerned

645
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,370
with access control

646
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,640
and all the future money they can make
buy controlling technology in ways I

647
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,210
never had

648
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:04,500
a imagine imagine if they got a fee from
you every time you saw something

649
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,610
on DVD magic they could tell when you
saw something on TV

650
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:11,810
missus politics it sounds like X by its

651
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,200
its it's something that they really are
banking on apparently and

652
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,410
we're running it with it easy argument
that copies which can use in case

653
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:22,520
DCSS and I think they're making the same
argument against

654
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,100
Kenya cannot be brought up at making I
think

655
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:30,170
against other DVD Lake copiers I guess
because they don't see them as a real

656
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,060
threat

657
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:34,940
Nailsea copying in my opinion elsa
copping as as a real threat to them when

658
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,330
they would go after the real copiers

659
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,330
they see knowledge how technology works

660
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,580
vis-a-vis hacking you know figuring
things out they see that as a real

661
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,440
threat because thats

662
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,450
thats lost control for them they can't
just magically

663
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,760
come up with these things that nobody
knows how they work they have to buy

664
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,890
them once you understand how it works

665
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,420
you can say this is bullshit has to it
this way instead and they

666
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:01,420
they don't want us to get to that point
thinking uses stated that

667
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,810
its access control according to region
is

668
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:11,180
unprecedented but that's not quite
correct in meeting the

669
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,980
video gaming industry there's a leader
in SS controlled

670
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,420
including region and of course the

671
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,920
ni the youth utilities used through this
the

672
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,370
for this word who were physically
weren't the

673
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,240
and the cryptographic that him this
isn't an impressive

674
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,600
was also NTSC PAL see he can I like
anything

675
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,839
but they've always been ways around it
people and

676
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,760
general issues that the kimchee

677
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,800
be this allows is this the

678
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,530
sorta circumvention thats that's my
understanding is that

679
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:50,200
that's their interpretation of it and
the interesting thing about it is that

680
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,780
they claim region coding is to protect

681
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:57,370
Hollywood studios say film gets released
in this country

682
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:01,480
are and then it goes to DVD at the same
time this released in theaters

683
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,660
in other countries out the capital that
often wear

684
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,710
some things on DVDs is just being leased
to tears but I can understand that it's

685
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,010
a case however

686
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:13,670
why are they releasing old movies in the
nineteen seventies with region coding

687
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:17,080
not being released in theaters anywhere
so it's clearly

688
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,480
wat making more money is away you know
we have to buy this twice a few

689
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,000
go from one country to another and they
can they can add to that they can make

690
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,200
it so that

691
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,610
you know if if you wanna play a
different kind a DVD player they can

692
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,980
you know at something that'll make a
sleek and play without buying it again

693
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,640
things max's fee you know so it's it's
beginning very ominous trend

694
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,470
and I think that while these other kind
restrictions have been in place in the

695
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,500
past

696
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,320
it's never been a legal to buy a DVD in
France

697
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,750
and get to play watch it in a DVD player
in your way

698
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,820
its it dats what dis is really about

699
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,830
in a lot of ways is it illegal for you
to watch to view to experience the

700
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:01,350
the creative expression that you've
already purchased on

701
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:05,500
dad just the hard and it's not just a
well it's a region coding and you can

702
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,600
you by passing it but it did it illegal
to bypass it

703
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,050
and since when has it been illegal to do
that and why does copyright law

704
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:18,620
make it illegal for me to buy a CD in
France and listen to it in the US and

705
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,250
and and broken a lot i mean that's not
copyright this is something else this is

706
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,280
an attempt to go further than my
copyright

707
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,790
will give you Jesse copyright my
interpretation is that

708
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,390
it ensures that the the creator the
owner of the work

709
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:35,520
gets your compensation for it 327

710
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,560
and I don't see any way that this is
being impeded

711
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,830
on wish with the CSS if you you watch a
movie on a Linux machine that you bought

712
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,029
already

713
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:47,990
how is that hurting the artist the first
created the movie

714
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:51,260
people in the mood doesn't already
bought it so obvious it is something

715
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,170
else going on here where they want

716
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,540
more compensation by having a license

717
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,800
for every single operating system out
there its

718
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,520
open source this doesn't lend itself to
that

719
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,009
I think it's dumb there's a lot of
misunderstandings about copyright law

720
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:11,090
and the biggest is that copyright law

721
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:15,070
is designed to up provide

722
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:18,850
economic incentive to artists well
that's sort of a misconception because

723
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,420
that's really the means

724
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:25,960
the copyright laws intent is to spread
knowledge and to spread education

725
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,660
and to encourage a flourishing public
domain in creative

726
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:33,690
works and so the economic incentive that
is provided to the optic

727
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:38,500
is demeans use to achieving the ants
which is an enlightened and educated

728
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,020
public which is necessary in a democracy

729
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,990
so what you see in many ways with the
recording industry in the motion picture

730
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:45,600
industry

731
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,870
is they get it back which they think
this is all about getting them money

732
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:53,060
when really getting their money is only
needs to providing

733
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:56,890
all of us with more education more
information and that's really copyright

734
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:00,129
ultimate objective and ultimate goal and
it's laid out in the Constitution

735
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,160
Article one Section eight

736
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:08,379
clout to promote the progress in science
and useful arts

737
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:15,380
its

738
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,930
want to bring up something about the

739
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:22,279
dddd netting corruption system arm in
our

740
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,080
I think this was like you know back in
the conception you on the DVD seen it

741
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,549
was first coming out Tom

742
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:32,050
I was thought the data encryption system
in your region coding all that stuff

743
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,530
which is something to

744
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:37,740
make the movie companies feel good about
you know it's like strong and solid

745
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,900
embracing marketing to it

746
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,830
but Tom as far as encryption system
there's anything else can it down my

747
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:45,440
muse like

748
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,080
wiping encryption on the island and put
a key on the same day just tells how did

749
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:50,950
the cryptic

750
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:54,120
is like if you know if they want to scan
to control 1d

751
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,470
two sons are licensing of like
controlling the microchip that drives

752
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:57,890
the

753
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:01,980
no optical read system some design the
optics system

754
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:05,220
you know the actual some component in
the drives

755
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,950
the enormous meet certain specifications
a licensing

756
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:13,620
otherwise you cannot manufacture this
hard used to like your hardware dongles

757
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:17,790
not very good at this yeah and I can't
get any you re some really good point

758
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,580
here in encryption is really not

759
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:23,460
in you all would notice much better than
me but encryption is really not the best

760
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,180
way to protect copyrighted content
because in order for clean kitchen to

761
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,850
work you need

762
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:31,400
both sides and the equation to want
something to be secret

763
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,240
and when the motion picture industry
sends out a DVD

764
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,900
with emitting cryptid they're the only
ones that want to add content to be

765
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,210
secret and all of us want maybe wanna
get at it and don't care whether or not

766
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,260
it secret so

767
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,460
will fill with it and figure out a way
to get it out there and so it

768
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,380
encryption is not the best method for
for creating

769
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,620
are for controlling copy infringement
infected in my opinion the best way to

770
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,839
do that is to create

771
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,330
any such state pp removed emotive and
the reasons for

772
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:02,870
for infringement and not simply prevents
are cutting all together

773
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:06,460
hours also gonna bring about the

774
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,710
copyright thing arm I am the holder

775
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:14,160
intellectual property myself and you
know I'm seen all these companies so

776
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,859
she'll

777
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:18,310
the way they're abusing copyright I mean
even as a y'all

778
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:22,779
intellectual property holder myself I
get to worried about that because

779
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,120
I mean the reason why is patents and
copyrights as

780
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:31,120
you I liked bill have the confidence of
putting my ideas on the internet or

781
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,089
whatever means

782
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:36,120
and letting them spreading let everybody
know about it without the fear some

783
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,819
company

784
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:41,070
exploiting in making money off it or
otherwise erasing my name of input their

785
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:41,780
name on it

786
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,830
but it sounds like these companies and
turned it into a

787
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:49,200
something completely ops rather than a
means of being able to protect

788
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,960
information Alltel territories is like
something

789
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,210
control to prevent people from gaining
access to it yes

790
00:46:56,210 --> 00:47:00,210
you're absolutely right any this is an
access control provisions although it to

791
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:01,730
CSS system does is

792
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:06,600
prevent all copying because technology
players state-licensed

793
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,230
DVD players gonna lie to copy anything
and so it is

794
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:15,030
cokie restriction but it's done under
the access restrictions vision and

795
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:19,000
DMCA sits on a roundabout way and it is
the reason why

796
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,970
they're trying to take more than what
the DMCA grandstand because the

797
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:26,850
restriction against the copy technology

798
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:30,960
wouldn't make deep DCSS illegal because
it allows people to exercise their fair

799
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,610
use rights

800
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:36,180
that's why they're going after dinner
the access permissions well you know

801
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:36,859
about like

802
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:40,660
you're just copying me a DVD arm and a
friend of mine that

803
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,810
actually one already Hong Kong China he
actually purchased

804
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:48,049
an actual bootleg DVD disc

805
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:51,430
we put it on a DVD Drive in Randy CSS on

806
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,770
and on movies are not protector in
credit

807
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:58,430
DCSS alike give you a message saying
it's bypassing in

808
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:02,299
says nothing to me d crept the movie
that we got

809
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:07,730
the actual like was an encryption movie
what i'm saying is when a copy that

810
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:09,630
movie all ages do a bit for bit

811
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:12,840
copy it doesn't really nothing to

812
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:18,040
prevent itself CTCSS does nothing itself
really to prevent against happy it's the

813
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,990
whole structure

814
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:22,170
requiring you to only experience the
movie

815
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,640
I'm architecture that prevent that
prevents to copy

816
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,660
me so one thing we have to get out to
people it's not about copying because

817
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:33,779
yeah that's half bifida transfers as how
it's done that's how all the pirate

818
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,520
DVD's

819
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,180
are me so this is got nothing to do with
copy

820
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:45,180
expression

821
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:47,320
let's say I'll

822
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,330
expecting the worst that Emanuel any

823
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:53,480
mister Garbus going to court on Monday
and they lose

824
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,600
well then day one day well it's a deal

825
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,910
their their their founder make they lose
with the FFL we stand behind them

826
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:02,830
through the in

827
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:07,340
tire long haul the appeals process we
are intending on taking this Court

828
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:13,440
this case to the Supreme Court bad
design its

829
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,480
members join al-qaida me

830
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,800
its provided a dependent on mexico df
guests and hopefully can spread the word

831
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,069
when they ask you

832
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:27,779
a haze or skinny what do you think the
new

833
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,480
you see the rules at their adopted which
would make reverse engineering saw for

834
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,060
illegal

835
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:35,828
how you think it might affect your case
well I think it is really interesting

836
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:36,720
you mention it because

837
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,920
if there had been a you see a tight I'll
legislation in place where this

838
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,180
reverse engineering originally took
place we might be in a little bit more

839
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,848
legal hot water and I'm if there was a
provision that

840
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:53,780
29 people the right to reverse engineer
certain PC technology

841
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,970
so you see day would be an incredible
threat to people's rights to reverse

842
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:58,630
engineer

843
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:03,130
another problem with that is that it can
prevent people from simply talking about

844
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,670
problems with technology

845
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:09,300
distributing other distributing
information about the weakness is a

846
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,660
technology or improvements to technology
is incredibly

847
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:16,259
incredibly dangerous and if it had been
in place where this

848
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:20,069
original members engineering to place we
would be in a lot more hot line

849
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:24,970
and we r Dr I'm glad you made that point

850
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:28,089
about supreme court because that's
actually one what I want to ask you

851
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:28,490
about

852
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:32,819
on cigars but a very interesting point
something to the extent that

853
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:35,869
what issue here's your ability to report

854
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:39,770
in the man as you see fit now as
mystical seen mentioned

855
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:45,339
if you examine his track record um it's
very obvious that you're intent was

856
00:50:45,339 --> 00:50:49,650
journalistic and this gives you a lot of
substantive law

857
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:53,220
Rome as obviously journalistic freedoms

858
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:56,540
Health First Amendment been legislated
great deal I'd be curious

859
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,550
aside from procedural issues such as
jurisdiction if this does

860
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,700
miss you I miss again mentioned that he
expected to win the 2nd circuit

861
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,700
if this goes to the 2nd circuit perhaps
the Supreme Court

862
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:10,319
what's urs substantive law arguments
would you be expecting to make

863
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,740
and some were contained in those would
you be asking them to strike at the

864
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,849
constitutionality

865
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:18,740
excuse me %uh the DMCA well its its

866
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:22,420
it's interesting that just cases many
ways the first to really interpret the

867
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,490
DMCA so

868
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:27,609
and if you look at the DMCA it's a mess
it's an absolute mess

869
00:51:27,609 --> 00:51:31,000
and it's impossible to decipher tell by
looking at it what it means because

870
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,470
they've got their provisions to
contradict each other

871
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:36,579
and their provisions that have to be red
sorghum all

872
00:51:36,579 --> 00:51:40,619
all in encompassing each other and so
it's so complicated

873
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:45,339
that the interpretations become out from
the DMCA is what's really important how

874
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:47,000
is it going to be interpreted

875
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,339
and because it could be interpreted
eighteen different ways let me tell you

876
00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:51,650
it's that complicated

877
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,810
and so what we're hoping for is

878
00:51:54,810 --> 00:52:00,000
an interpretation that allows the first
man to continue that allows for fair use

879
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
in reverse engineering rights to
continue

880
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,589
and if the DMCA cannot be interpreted in
such a fashion and I think it can

881
00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:10,759
but if it can't any boldly to overturn
the DNC out again

882
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:15,270
make way for the next panel which

883
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:20,420
actually is related to this science will
start at about 10 minutes to check em

884
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,790
more people to be on thanks for coming
thank you its
