91
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,400
surrounding this case

92
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,930
and you are required to keep an open
mind throughout this don't take anything

93
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,910
you've heard

94
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,920
prior to this case any information we
receive from many sources

95
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,850
you may not consider it when
deliberating this case the only thing

96
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,810
you may consider

97
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,000
is the evidence which has been adduced
through the testimony of the witnesses

98
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,010
will be called

99
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,230
please understand that anything that the
lawyers say

100
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:19,130
anything that I say is not evidence only
the testimony given by the witnesses and

101
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,390
you are to take that evidence

102
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,909
and you are to determine whether it is
factual and on factual my way he will

103
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,730
give it now give further instructions at
the close to this trial

104
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,210
but keep that in mind at all times the
order the trial

105
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,170
is going to be the plaintiffs are going
to give an opening statement which they

106
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,120
will tell you what they intend to prove
in this case

107
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,669
at which time the defendant will give
their opening statement they intend to

108
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,478
prove or disprove the plaintiffs

109
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,240
the point this will call witnesses at
which time they will conduct direct

110
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,200
examination

111
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,620
the defense will have an opportunity to
cross-examine these witnesses

112
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,450
then the defendant will call a their
witnesses if they call any

113
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,670
the paper the plaintiff's attorney will
have an opportunity to cross-examine

114
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,569
and at that time the defense will give
their closing arguments in the plant

115
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,100
that will give their closing arguments

116
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,790
I'll give some brief final instructions
and which time you will

117
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,490
deliberate this case now before we begin
are there any

118
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:17,450
motions by the plaintiff motion for
summary judgment denied

119
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:24,400

head different her I'll

125
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,180
I what what we intend to here

126
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,500
is that the dependent an annual thing

127
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,149
violated the Copyright Act amended bring
the circumvention

128
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:59,790
the technology protecting copyright
something that is

129
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,349
so influential to

130
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,020
this country and it you must find a
preponderance the evidence

131
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,899
morning more likely than not you don't
have no reasonable doubt here

132
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:17,870
this is a civil trial you had just have
to find more likely than not that the

133
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,500
defendant

134
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,830
is liable for circumventing

135
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,990
very offering to the public this techno
technological circumvention

136
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,160
I'll the defendant here

137
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,819
has violated the section on 17 USC

138
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,140
on section 1201 on ATG in which he may
not

139
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,250
of her otherwise provide traffic any
technology

140
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:45,020
is primarily designed to circumvent the
technology that control the access

141
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,970
to work detected under the Copyright Act
DVD's are protected under the Copyright

142
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,570
Act

143
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,170
on the defending here has provided

144
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,890
access to several places many places as
a matter of fact

145
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,130
that allow for people to

146
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,270
going and access to certain that it
technology he's offering is free to the

147
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,020
public

148
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,029
and we're a small 426 million dollars in
damages

149
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:14,520

150
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,680
defense their opening statement

151
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:25,480
but your aunt

152
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,959
a want to talk about what exactly is on
trial here

153
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,970
the prosecution on behalf of a group
that has the audacity to refer to itself

154
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,470
but the Motion Picture Association of
America

155
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,829
even though they returned the film
makers in america including Eric

156
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:46,680
corley were not represented by at will
say that the

157
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,300
the defendant has attacked intellectual
property in

158
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,940
that he may try to transform this the

159
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,070
a rather they may try to transform this
case into

160
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,510
me an issuer preserving artists Rights
the benefit from their creative efforts

161

words like piracy will come up meteor is

162
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,260
un-american and that it is your
responsibility jurors

163
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,010
as americans to find him guilty but

164
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,279
guilty avoid

165
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,640
they will try to make you ignore that
this case is that it's hard about Eric's

166
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,360
and your

167
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,640
inalienable 200-year-old first amendment
rights

168
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,890
make you believe he deserves to be
punished because the law that was put on

169
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,949
the books within the last two years
which criminalizes behavior never before

170
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:35,699
classified as criminal by our government

171
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:40,690
reverse engineering

172
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,890
has become the rule in our society it
made incredible innovation possible it's

173
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,339
laying the groundwork for the entire
revolution that

174
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:51,420
has transformed our economy into an
information

175
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,110
driven economy although there is done

176
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:00,320
is participate in that as a publisher
ever corley is a publisher

177
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,680
he has the right to distribute any
information

178
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,630
that is not slanderous libelous
fraudulent and that is not violate any

179
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,990
copyright laws

180
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,209
the NCAA is an attempt to

181
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:17,720
place a pre-emptive attack on our fair
use rights

182
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,660
water those you may ask it happens to be
the case that when you buy

183
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,110
copyrighted material as soon as you buy
it

184
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,190
the copyright holder no longer has any
rights over the copyrighted object

185
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:35,279
the Supreme Court is tubers recently
just this year upheld

186
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,699
the first sale rule Council I will
instruct the jury on the law is not your

187
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:40,100
place

188
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,350
nope star George I am

189
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,089
well by to say that the

190
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:52,410
a the long-standing tradition

191
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,040
I'll above from I'll copyright

192
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,719
law enables people who buy copyrighted
object

193
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,339
to to use them as they see fit so long
as they do not violate

194
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,810
certain terms now want this is all
sorted

195
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:14,089
beside the point Erica publisher has
some

196
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:17,569
has simply made available to the public
at large

197
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:21,339
material that the that is a rather

198
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:26,189
the CSS code that makes it possible for
people to access information

199
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:30,310
I once you purchase it no one can tell
you how you can and cannot

200
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,660
access the information that is Sam

201
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,459
that is more than a two hundred-year-old
tradition I

202
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:42,550
we will establish in fact that this
particular tool

203
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:47,930
is it a and the DCSS rather is the
coolest part of a larger toolbox

204
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,410
being assembled by people seeking to
exercise their fair use rights

205
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:57,400
online Xboxes that would be computer
using Linux operating system currently

206
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,390
in

207
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,890
the some the manufactory at the MPAA

208
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,699
has a has created a licensing procedure

209
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:13,040
whereby only the manufacturers have DVD
players who buy beer decryption code

210
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,099
can use I'm cake and

211
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,439
rather license that can play their
software only those I

212
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:23,439
many factors can you that software the
Linux

213
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:27,060
community never had a player provided to
them and

214
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,120
the effort to produce the DCSS is part
of an open source movement which will

215
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,939
get into later

216
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:36,490
your honor ground ground statement is
misleading there is a

217
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:41,319
legal good completely Things They
Carried is a legal ground for it there's

218
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:42,270
a legal

219
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,270
I machine minute you can play DVD's

220
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,540
with that in a minute objection is
overruled the

221
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,650
you can bring evidence during the trial

222
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:57,069
a with regard to that subject the
content please continue counseling

223
00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:01,530
well i I'll wrap up here on

224
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,670
the point is that a ever quarterly at
the publisher

225
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,890
has the right to distribute this
information and

226
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,949
you know the things that people may do
with that information they they may or

227
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:14,900
may not be criminal

228
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,890
but Eric's a eric has the benefit of a
presumption of innocence

229
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:24,000
and writer this is a civil trial

230
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,339
gestures stand

231
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:31,140
a

232
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,770
banana innocent and maybe I'm with a
counselor

233
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:42,610
his me I'm

234
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,300
I am actually going to a few feet prefer
the judge had like two

235
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,009
you my my colleague Michael Council an
opportunity to make some statement

236
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:55,339
briefly good

237
00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:00,459
thank you your honor I'm going to %uh

238
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:03,660
be I'm gonna tell you a secret

239
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,319
I'm sure we all must be aware by now up
lawyers

240
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,319
speak a strange language and

241
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,129
it sounds like English by I none if it
makes any sense

242
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,020
and while we may not use secret
handshakes I like the Free Masons or the

243
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,908
Knights Templar

244
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:23,010
we do you secret code words and

245
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,049
I'm gonna tell you want that whole word
right now by

246
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:30,070
we have a term may describe lives

247
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,470
matter unwanted unsolicited

248
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,630
lot that make no sense serve no purpose

249
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,950
and do no good we call such lies

250
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,559
spam

251
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:48,610
and my counselor counselor are you going
to going to the fact that this case if

252
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,080
you'll indulge me for just a moment

253
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,790
your honor a very brief moment and
please make sure

254
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,629
that you are not going in that direction
a

255
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,710
towards something which is up the
legislature

256
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:05,630
the appellate courts and not up to a
jury understand I thank your honor

257
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,539
at K so

258
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,210
here

259
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:16,470
well we'll skip that argument a

260
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,490
let's talk about the NCAA very briefly

261
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,520
at the NCAA the witch hunt it's a lot

262
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,570
in search of a crime me doesn't exist
I'm just when the resident the sound

263
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,700
Massachusetts Sen

264
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,830
up at 1692

265
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,689
I when they couldn't find any which is
they went in search of up

266
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,160
up and when thirty to terrorize the
general populace

267
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,820
just so too does the NCAA find failed to
find any more legitimate say

268
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,290
and is therefore been set up on our
common-sense notions of what is right

269
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,159
and what is wrong

270
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,290
what is right is that copyrighted works
should not be pirated

271
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,870
and are already laws on the books that
make piracy illegal

272
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,630
but my client is not charged with piracy
and it's a very important factor like

273
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,799
the jury keep in mind

274
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,730
this is not about piracy my client is
not being charged with piracy

275
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:09,080
might my client has been charged with
circulating

276
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,860
a computer program that allows you to
watch DVD's on your computer

277
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,020
a program that extends your viewing
options

278
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,410
this is also a right what is right is
that you should be able to watch your

279
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:20,960
movies

280
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,510
on the platform at your choice but the
NCAA make this

281
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,280
but well I would say that the
prosecution week when the NCAA make this

282
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,000
a legal

283
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,950
at the NCAA counselor this not a
prosecution is a civil case

284
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,780
is myth author on

285
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,950
I like tell you another secret find a

286
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:48,380
hinged

287
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,249
okay so far so good

288
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:54,139
it's a secret that the MPAA doesn't want
you to know

289
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:58,090
and it's a secret that frankly this
court that the one you know either

290
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,949
you when I hear to determine the guilt
or innocence that my client

291
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,509
you're here to validate a law you're
like the president

292
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:12,489
who's sitting in his oval office at it
said Stephanie oval office in a bill has

293
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:13,789
just been brought before you

294
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:17,590
this bill is that the MCI it requires
your signature

295
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,629
your seal of approval an outlier on a
lil

296
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:25,129
a little over the line this a is a jury

297
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:28,599
determine a verdict in a civil case this
is not a

298
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:33,200
legislative body in

299
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,499
kinda saying I'm not a making an analogy

300
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:40,360
well it is a poor analogy

301
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,960
and I i'm not going to warn you again
understand your honor roll we're going

302
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,880
to move on then

303
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,909
here

304
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:52,980
but the point here is that the NCAA is a
brand new and untested law

305
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,740
I don't think there's any dispute there
and

306
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,090
yeah it is like a submarine

307
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,159
have been

308
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,340
in

309
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,629
has everything is like a submarine
they've been hastily patch together and

310
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,840
talk of

311
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,439
okay that's enough with the analogies
counselor

312
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,340
a

313
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,129
I think that at how long the law has
been on the books

314
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,380
is completely irrelevant and the

315
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,830
submarine the slash a legislative

316
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,520
bill-signing analogies have come to an
end

317
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,850
I please finish your opening statement
yes your honor I apologized

318
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:43,760
ahead yes I'm going to i'm going to
conclude my remarks

319
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,790
and hand the microphone over to bike

320
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,280
packet switcher

321
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,410
ladies and gentlemen please this is a
trial had a

322
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:59,200
way in

323
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,350

MPAA you would have to have him

510
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,359
qualified as an expert first

511
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:08,470

00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,399
K a in a passive you ever

563
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:49,400
published computer codes on your website
I don't recall

564
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:54,590
publishing computer code per se unless
you want to consider HTML code

565
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:59,580
as computer code in which case we
publish quite a bit

566
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,730
um why would you

567
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:07,210
a have you have you ever published
computer source code on your website

568
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,400
we publish computer source code in our
magazine

569
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,630
which is affiliated with our website min

570
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,760
and what was your intent when you did
publish

571
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,170
the code in your magazine the

572
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:25,070
non-bcs you mean I'm not before just
broadly speaking

573
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,670
when you publish why do you publish what
you doing educate

574
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,910
to share information to show people how
things work or

575
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,859
don't work you enjoy this I enjoy what I
do

576
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,910
you consider the the first amendment

577
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,359
critical your ability to enjoy these
he's never cease

578
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,160
is a the things you do by the I think
the first amendment pretty cool

579
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,290
a let

580
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:55,480
let's get to the theater have you ever
I'm the giver publish the DCSS in your

581
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,980
magazine or on your website

582
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,310
um it been on the website has not been
in the magazine

583
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:04,430
I did you write ECSS

584
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:07,779
oh no no no no somebody else wrote that
all we did was

585
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,760
with was print the source code and and
print the story going along with this

586
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,540
record

587
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:18,060
you mean now all you did was publish
coded someone up your honor after an

588
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,610
answer

589
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:24,940
overruled I do was published code that
someone else had written

590
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,140
yes I I can even write a basic
programming all I i basically

591
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,629
we just published a Moscow where you be

592
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:35,230
first publisher DCSS no I was not

593
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:38,290
would you say that

594
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:41,779
and since you band

595
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,050
think you've been forced to take the CSS
code of your website

596
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,450
that I'm it impossible for anyone to get
dcfs anywhere

597
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:54,070
now objection to call for speculation
stand

598
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,830
I judge actually the

599
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:01,470
the the the defendant is an expert on

600
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:05,570
on web related publishing and we would
actually no

601
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,560
wouldn't be specter that he made it you
might actually know that it does exist

602
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,190
on the web

603
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:13,320
the fan is not been qualified as an
expert anything at this time

604
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,090
I head

605
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:24,090
moment sure 1

606
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:30,250
you no longer actually publish the code
on your website butter

607
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:35,020
is there any way that someone visiting
your site might actually find the code

608
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:40,930
on the wet on the whole web on the whole
where the world what we have a listed

609
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,640
links

610
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,509
to other sites that might still have the
code out you can also find

611
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,030
that same list or bigger list by going
through things like info seek

612
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:55,750
owned by Disney Adelyn mmm-hmm a

613
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:02,160
at this time judge it actually like you
I'm

614
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,420
enter into the enter into evidence

615
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,349
that yeah

616
00:41:10,349 --> 00:41:13,470
entered evidence the I'm some some
evidence

617
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,869
mad establishing that the

618
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:20,210
that in fact by going to I disney's

619
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,859
search engine one can actually get and

620
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:27,480
one can actually have find the CSS

621
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:34,480
the show at some point this council

622
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,640
this with printed earlier today it is a

623
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,868
panetta a a through the links offered

624
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:50,849
in response to entering DCSS that go
dark on the go network is owned by

625
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:53,150
Disney which is a member the MPAA

626
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:57,390
buddy i three an interview or and

627
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:02,989
yesterday Council you have an objection
to this being and evidence this time

628
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:09,069
can't

629
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:14,880
what defense exhibit a is movement
evident

630
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,219
I'm a manual that you ever pirated DVD

631
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:22,059
no I have not I am

632
00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:26,109
have you ever I'm advocated the piracy
of DVD's

633
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:30,989
no I have not I've been now I'm

634
00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:34,819
then why why would you publish

635
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:38,479
the DCSS or any links to the set CSS

636
00:42:38,479 --> 00:42:42,009
because it has nothing to do with piracy
it has nothing to do with piracy

637
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:45,239
has nothing to do with piracy could you
elaborate on that well it's

638
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:51,209
got something to do with figuring out
how to play a DVD on a Linux machine or

639
00:42:51,209 --> 00:42:56,009
on other platforms but you could always
copy DVD's before this can I am

640
00:42:56,009 --> 00:42:59,049
has nothing to do with tired

641
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:02,979
great author with my colleagues have any
questions

642
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:08,949
i'm satisfied address

643
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:13,549
yet you mean the year through it which
is directed at anyone who would record

644
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,779

moment

804
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:27,630
sorry for causing you consider that that
published %uh the fact that you publish

805
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:31,870
dcfs is to spread news spread
information is a sensor to journalism

806
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:35,450
that you consider its information

807
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:38,890
we print information information

808
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:42,549
irate now in formation okay

809
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:46,230
in your opening act anything exciting

810
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:49,280
do you anything coming to action

811
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,870

812
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:56,210
this way to celebrating call it the
certificates inside anyone to do

813
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,080
anything

814
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,680
sometimes we may suggest things we print
opinion pieces

815
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,930
so this is the so-called sharing
information

816
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:07,980
is that something like tell Congress to
start DMCA

817
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,820
from 2600 website or about February 13
2000

818
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:16,950
something else from March 23rd 2008
fuckin we see that karma in regards to

819
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:17,490
that

820
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:22,010
we'd like to see a more comprehensive
like NBC's site become established this

821
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:24,360
is after he received a threatening
letter from you

822
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:28,350
from NBC's general counsel and you
wanted to see more color

823
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:33,029
there is no question counselor would it
be okay mister

824
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:36,670
you will be reasonable perhaps for
someone

825
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:40,520
to be able do you think that somebody
might be able to view your site

826
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:45,500
as something that spread the store to
I'm information that may be considered a

827
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,710
propaganda and or possibly on

828
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:52,040
illegal information illegal information

829
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,240
think information that is considered

830
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,420
to be something that I'm to be something
that you've already

831
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:03,670
known about that you were supposed to
take down like judge but can we see that

832
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:04,290
hope

833
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:08,529
Judge movie The before poor man you
would answer that you would

834

illegal information actually is

835

so that you can enter intelligently is
there yeah

836
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:20,920
into the question on we're willing to
have him answer it

837
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,390
if he can be supplied with the
definition that the court would I

00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:58,480
what is the theater it's not the cation
that

869
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:03,710
the crips see if they think that the
content and

870
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:07,160
did you write this utility yes I'm one
of the author

871
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,790
been and why did you write this utility

872
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:15,359
I will hit that open source operating
system

873
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:18,490
the kathleen could have a BB that

874
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:21,730
so you're familiar with open source and

875
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:24,380
is it safe to assume that you're
familiar with something called the open

876
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:25,339
source movement

877
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:29,140
at you can you tell court a little bit
about what you believed to be the open

878
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,779
source movement

879
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:35,069
if the movement that believes the all
applications should come with or

880
00:58:35,069 --> 00:58:39,480
so they will be able to modify it and
fell and the correct but

881
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,790
and I make changes to the softer and

882
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:46,630
order to make it better can you clarify

883
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:49,829
the court exactly how do you see if it
fits into

884
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:53,150
the entirety the open source movement
well

885
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:57,290
mean and operating system though they
open for

886
00:58:57,290 --> 00:59:00,930
and be yet this is also open for

887
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:04,440
and I complement of live in Linux

888
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,780
video and video development group

889
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:11,890

894
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:35,270
to your knowledge Tuesday ECSS
facilitate

895
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:39,240
in any way copying or pirating DVD

896
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,690
no not them lol and

897
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:46,660
do you believe pirating DVD's can
negatively affect

898
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:52,089
the DVD industry in well I'm not an
expert on

899
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:55,770
how I'm impact but do you believe that
people

900
00:59:55,770 --> 01:00:01,849
a to blatantly copying DVD's and
distributing them to their friends can

901
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:02,800
have an effect

902
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:07,660
on DVD sales in the industry out just an
objection to that question

903
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:11,420
this is speculative click here

904
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:15,420
speculation

905
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:18,589
thank you your honor

906
01:00:18,589 --> 01:00:23,519
said

907
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:28,279
when you created the CSS is it safe to
assume that

908
01:00:28,279 --> 01:00:31,709
you did not intend for it to be used in
any manner

909
01:00:31,709 --> 01:00:36,920
to pirate DVD absolutely cashier at a
hearsay confiscated my at the time

910
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,390
overall okay

911
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:44,049
your honor I would like to introduce
piece of evidence right now

912
01:00:44,049 --> 01:00:47,788
this is a report that tracked

913
01:00:47,789 --> 01:00:51,989

01:00:59,479 --> 01:01:03,069

315,000 136 DVD players

players

920
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:19,969

that DVD sales are not affected by the
ECSS utility

927
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:58,030

are dependent that her client has as I

good

987
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:20,960
the defense breath one before moving
here closing arguments as a defense have

988
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:21,690
any motions

989
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:26,400
what we would be would move to

990
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,330
have the the case thrown out on the
grounds that our client hasn't done

991
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:30,970
anything

992
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:37,630
illegal who lighted

993
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:40,690
I good

994
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:43,960
yes your I'm much cheaper and

995
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,340
met know you first hear your response to
the motion

996
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:53,120
let me rephrase that: kind that kinda
not done anything illegal

997
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:56,740
and yeah I like to respond to that a
Heath

998
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:01,970
in he had endured he takin he pay him
think that circumvent art technology

999
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:05,200
that we've got we created it ours ours
ours

1000
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:10,750
actually a to the I will I will and I
will deny a motion

1001
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:13,920
parade directed verdict I i win for the
record I would like to know that the

1002
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:14,630
plaintive

1003
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:18,660
just a moment ago said that no harm had
actually the case wasn't about any harm

1004
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,300
having been done and now he said

1005
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,670
i think i win motion for a directed
verdict is denied

1006
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:27,530
the point that have any motions there
like a magnet arm

1007
01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:31,410
Nair very well we are we do have

1008
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:35,290
one motion one last mission wanna but
here

1009
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:38,660
and that is to enter into the record
testimony

1010
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:43,330
and the other evidence establishing that
on as a matter fact

1011
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:47,290
the no harm has been done to my DVD
sales

1012
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:50,630
as a result synth since the inception
movie theater that's

1013
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:54,590
I still have only gone up at an
accelerating rate year under

1014
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:57,920
more and more money on this and hear
other defendant did not call any

1015
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,940
witnesses to interpret a good start

1016
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:03,280
and I believe under frei way thousand
what

1017
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,720
7 I believe and you usually have devil
width

1018
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,570
on some sort of layperson to interpret
the results and

1019
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:16,660
miss the Cohen and Europe

1020
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:19,660
hinges

1021
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:25,279
into in about a minute mistake are you
referring to the evidence

1022
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:28,779
which you were attempting to move a
earlier

1023
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:32,029
which was that denied that time for lack
of proper foundation

1024
01:08:32,029 --> 01:08:35,149
your honor we would like to change

1025
01:08:35,149 --> 01:08:41,759
foundation of that evidence a yes you
know is there is that the evidence to

1026
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,750
which you're referring now

1027
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:46,260
yes that is the oven emotion is it
denies there was no further

1028
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:49,870
evidence brought out the to the
foundation a

1029
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:53,099
that chart and the jury may not consider
and the deliberations

1030
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:57,890
you have arrested a case and you have no
opportunities quality for the witnesses

1031
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:01,109
a

1032
01:09:01,109 --> 01:09:04,940
him

1033
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:08,940
I for the motions by the defense now you
know

1034
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:12,589
planted no thank you %um

1035
01:09:12,589 --> 01:09:16,910
defense we will hear your closing
arguments this time

1036
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:23,910
would good

1037
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:30,170
been well I'm we heard some interesting
things up here

1038
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:34,089
and jurors I and I must tell you that

1039
01:09:34,089 --> 01:09:40,519
did I can be your task will you be
you're going back before you know it

1040
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:45,460
the case it seems to me I am in the end
as you going to do with deliberations

1041
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:50,420
is about down a presumption of innocence
purse is a presumption of guilt

1042
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:54,130
I who is really being subversive here

1043
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:59,070
on the one hand we have a record earlier
publisher I'm all that they can muster

1044
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:02,070
is that someone may visit 2600 website

1045
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:07,620
may use it to find the CSS and many and
many may use that to do something

1046
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,340
illegal

1047
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:11,360
this is Timmy tantamount to

1048
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,410
but crime you think a certain way

1049
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:18,090
therefore you're inevitably inevitably
going to do something illegal for before

1050
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:19,600
you do something illegal just

1051
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,920
flappy irons I know and and this is a

1052
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,050
I'm the United States of America where I
mister corley

1053
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:29,590
enjoys the first amendment right to
publish anything

1054
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:33,380
added that he decided to publish
regardless about controversial it is

1055
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:34,400
regardless the

1056
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:39,860
have anything the that through the
plaintiff israelis get here on Eric

1057
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:43,009
defended not what enter anything
regarding

1058
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:47,030
persimmon into evidence what relevance
does free speech heaven on earth

1059
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:50,800
skills card rejection is

1060
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,080
sustained this is a civil case does not
involve

1061
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:58,309
first-amendment boiled

1062
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:03,500
ladies and gentlemen please control
yourself or the available control you

1063
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:07,530
a

1064
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:11,200
dude our client

1065
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,700
is a publisher I think that we've
established that

1066
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:18,269
and I will remind you

1067
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:22,020
a the right to publishers enjoy in this
country objection your honor

1068
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:25,700
and they don't know the right publishers
enjoy in this country they're not

1069
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:29,769
instructor specific guidelines are you
do so cracked action is overall

1070
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:32,930
on the other hand we have

1071
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:38,270
the MPAA this goes to the question about
exactly who is being subversive here

1072
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:42,220
the MPAA makes one million dollars on
every license that they give to

1073
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:44,360
manufacturers have DVD players

1074
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:49,349
they have a vested interest in making
sure that a enlisted interest in making

1075
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:50,390
sure that

1076
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:53,880
the open source community does not
develop a player that can function on

1077
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,270
line Xboxes

1078
01:11:55,270 --> 01:12:00,170
precisely because at this monopoly that
they enjoy I will wear under I would

1079
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:01,230
remind be there

1080
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:05,810
there's injection that there's nothing
in evidence about

1081
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:09,070
as enjoying a monopoly or having a
vested interest

1082
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:13,940
in the open source community or anything
else I'm gonna wreck the objection is

1083
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:18,110
stand please do not speak at the facts
which are not in evidence in this case

1084
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:22,630
well I will ahead

1085
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:27,740
I will close my remarks not the
defense's remarks by

1086
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:30,849
thing that the MPAA has

1087
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:34,390
early as a

1088
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:38,040
sir please control yourself has brought
the

1089
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:42,570
mister gold steam to pirate hey you're
under

1090
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:45,710
miscible anti people the trial for

1091
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:50,500
the proper at suffered for no action for
note for no discernible action that is

1092
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,470
cause them any discernible

1093
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:56,030
harm and and with that remark

1094
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:59,179
I I hand he

1095
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:03,840
march over to good

1096
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,340
Co kelso would like to remark to the
jury just

1097
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:10,740
to remember summit things that have
actually been able to get into evidence

1098
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:11,719
this evening

1099
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,090
and that is that that the CSS

1100
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:19,690
was utility that did not facilitate

1101
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:25,010
in any way the pirating other DVD and
that you have to remember when you make

1102
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:26,310
your decisions that

1103
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:30,580
can something that doesn't facilitate
pirating have a DVD

1104
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:35,030
I'll the MPAA that's what we like the
clothes when

thank you want

1197

a here ladies and gentlemen

1198
01:20:10,489 --> 01:20:14,310
we're going to have a an interesting
judicial economy a

1199
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:18,760
briefer charges for the jury I will
first remind you what I told you earlier

1200
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:19,870
in this case that you

1201
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:24,130
a way to keep an open mind during the
presentation of this case and you still

1202
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:26,969
must keep an open mind you begin your
deliberations

1203
01:20:26,969 --> 01:20:30,120
you may only consider items which were
entered into evidence

1204
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:34,190
a is items which were moved into
evidence or testimony presented by the

1205
01:20:34,190 --> 01:20:34,930
witnesses

1206
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:38,580
if there was a question asked by one of
the attorneys and which there was an

1207
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:39,739
objection to

1208
01:20:39,739 --> 01:20:44,100
and that objection was sustained you are
not consider any partial answer you and

1209
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,630
I think it's through the questions

1210
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:49,940
by the attorneys you may only consider
the questions made by the attorneys as

1211
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:50,860
they pertain

1212
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:54,469
to the answers which were given an
answer was given yes and there was no

1213
01:20:54,469 --> 01:20:55,739
objection sustained

1214
01:20:55,739 --> 01:21:00,130
you may consider the attorneys question
to make sense that the answer

1215
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:03,140
you may not consider any items which are
not

1216
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:06,830
in evidence in this case you be
violating your own as jurors

1217
01:21:06,830 --> 01:21:10,480
now if this is not a criminal case this
is a civil case

1218
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:14,920
you may have heard the term beyond a
reasonable doubt that is a term which is

1219
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:15,710
an

1220
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:20,340
criminal at cases this as a civil case

1221
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:24,190
is governed up by the preponderance of
the evidence that is that you were to

1222
01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:24,960
consider

1223
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:29,790
all the evidence which has been given in
this case now you are to determine

1224
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:33,199
whether the by the credibility of the
witnesses

1225
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:36,920
and their demeanor the answers they gave

1226
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,949
whether you determine that evidence to
be back

1227
01:21:39,949 --> 01:21:43,110
in this case and taking the totality

1228
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:46,460
up the evidence and the facts as you
determined to be

1229
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:50,760
you are to use it is it imagine is if
there was a scale

1230
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:54,110
and it was evident from both sides I
decided to scale

1231
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:57,400
51 percent is generally

1232
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,850
a is generally given to let the jury

1233
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:07,290
figure out which side is liable website
whether the defendant is liable

1234
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:10,650
are not liable it the scale

1235
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:14,290
hips slightly in favor plaintiff

1236
01:22:14,290 --> 01:22:18,199
then you must find the defendant liable
in this case on the other hand at the

1237
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:18,710
scale

1238
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:22,679
heads slightly in a favor the defendant
then you must find him

1239
01:22:22,679 --> 01:22:26,520
not liable now I'm going to let you

1240
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:29,540
begin your deliberations I would note
that

1241
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:33,300
in the interest of judicial economy in
the schedule a bit scored we will only

1458
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:35,750
I guess we will file a motion for
acquittal do you have a motion at this

1459
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:38,449
time for judgment on the verdict I

and we have prove their case and we have
%uh

1463
01:40:49,059 --> 01:40:52,099
and that the jury had made it clear

1464
01:40:52,099 --> 01:40:55,480
and they're finding the back of counsel
defense

1465
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:59,349
would like to be heard on the
plaintiff's motion for judgment on the

1466
01:40:59,349 --> 01:41:02,349
verdict your honor we

1467
01:41:02,349 --> 01:41:06,460
firmly believe that the facts of this
case clearly

1468
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:11,099
show that manual gold thing is not
liable for any damages the MPAA

1469
01:41:11,099 --> 01:41:15,929
would like to send a record that a
judgment

1470
01:41:15,929 --> 01:41:19,789
or rather you overruling the the verdict
of the jury

1471
01:41:19,789 --> 01:41:24,059
no would be not in the interest of
justice their jury of my peers

1472
01:41:24,059 --> 01:41:27,429
and they made a decision we believe the
court should stick to it

1473
01:41:27,429 --> 01:41:30,940
thank you be right in considering

1474
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:34,280
via evidence in this case the testimony
was presented

1475
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:37,900
I do not believe there is cause for its
judgment on the verdict and therefore

1476
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:38,239
the

1477
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:41,849
a jury's verdict stands they're not here
