supplies arrived a week later they
comprehend the printer broke do that

106
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,850
that helped I'm that everybody I get a
chance to find a hidden message

107
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,120
that was embedded in these cards who has
not seen hidden message

108
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,940
I don't have a hidden message for some
reason what it does anybody want any

109
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,440
hints on the second message

110
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,630
okay I it's a two-word message

111
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,490
%uh import to most people will notice

112
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,889
room and most people in the community
are

113
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:30,480
12 the keys is it not in the hologram

114
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,919
I all and the color purple

115
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,218
has something to do with it ok he told
the card it is

116
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,240
certain angle so if there's any hologram
over the purple area

117
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,850
the hologram disappears good light is
helpful in this

118
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,180
quest

119
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,370
you don't have a red

120
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,709
yet with Mr you can take the same car
Joe the one person ace where they don't

121
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:01,829
see another presents right there

122
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:05,600
so it's a highly subjective for my

123
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,650
whoever can see the message raise your
hands

124
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,390
hey we got a lot of people here and they
know what's the matter with you

125
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,420
by I read it on someone's part I can
read it on mine it's not on my

126
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:24,420
he carried on my neck ahead

127
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:31,629
taken

128
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:33,939
if anyone has a card is hard to read
between a

129
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:38,549
you become up and grab another one try
to limit it to

130
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:41,869
2 per card here 2 per person

131
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:45,369
lanyard unfortunately they got

132
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:50,649
ship back to Long Island here

133
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:56,730
well I'll give away the box in a second
take no more than two cards please are

134
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,399
we won't have enough for everybody to
take a couple souvenirs him

135
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:05,819
I think you have a hologram round tufted

136
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:08,979
yet these are the standard no escort
reported

137
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:14,629
sorry I here

138
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:20,910
every day you have to pay extra for the
escort but in most high-security areas

139
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,160
%uh the legend no escort required mean
didn't go around quoting

140
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,469
without an escort by yourself

141
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,779
take to please try not to take more than
two

142
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:35,470
that's like 20 Britain

143
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:42,470
