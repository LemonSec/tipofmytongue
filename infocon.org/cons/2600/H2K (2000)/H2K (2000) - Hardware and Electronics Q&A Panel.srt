1
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,489
is there or a start

2
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:45,489
well

3
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,890
and

4
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,309
nice and warm G

5
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:00,080
good

6
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,160
smack my hoes although alright

7
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,370
hey can you guys hear me in the back is
that a yes or a No

8
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,700
now can you guys hear me in the back now

9
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,390
no okay alright

10
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,940
you're here at the hardware

11
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,100
and electronics Q&A panel my name is
kingpin

12
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,430
there's a job a man a Brian oblivion

13
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,430
is supposed to be here I'm sure he'll
show up late so

14
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,800
if you're at the wrong pain I can't
leave now because we're watching you is

15
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,649
actually gonna be a hard act to follow
after CDC but

16
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:48,250
it's probably gonna be a little more
boring but I basically what this is

17
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,270
is a roundtable discussion

18
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,530
I about hardware electronics issues
anything any questions no questions are

19
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,229
stupid

20
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,259
if you have like the flea market
something something you found in the

21
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,740
trash you don't know what it is
hopefully brought it we can

22
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,869
discuss and check it out the questions
don't need to be targeted to one of us

23
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:10,989
if you just want to ask a general
question go ahead and I'm sure there's

24
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:13,080
someone else in the room that's going to
be able to answer it

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,140
um obviously we don't know everything is
just a

26
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,310
good way for everybody to get some
discussions in I'm

27
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,720
so before we open it up to questions
what we're gonna do is run through

28
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,680
Who We R Who where we come from and some
the current project we're working on

29
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,060
so as I said before kingpin I come from
Boston

30
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,250
I am member a block to the industry's
which is currently the

31
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,130
at stake research development labs so I
get to research things all day long

32
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,620
um when I enjoy doing the most

33
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,110
is reverse engineering hardware products
a

34
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,019
mostly hardware security products any
products really but

35
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,870
our security products currently are the
best things to look at there's a lot of

36
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,420
problems with them it's kind of a new
field so there's a lot of

37
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,010
a.m. problems with the developers and
they're not really sure how to implement

38
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,399
security in their products

39
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,760
um a mother and a portable electronics
in microprocessor system designed so

40
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,040
basic embedded system type stuff um

41
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,859
something I announced back in 1997 that
beyond hope

42
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,090
got three years ago um was I was doing a
lot a Palm Pilot development

43
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,830
I'm since then the the whole PDA feel
this card on a lot so it's

44
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,709
it's a know it's really blown up in
Upshur half the people here at least

45
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:27,680
have palm pilots

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,080
I announced award I love that I was
working on back then

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,500
didn't have a name a I just finished it

48
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,010
is called TBA I has a a bunch of
different meetings you can think of one

49
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,739
that you want um

50
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,209
what it is is is basically a a word I'll
or portable word either

51
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,420
on throwed up in a ceiling if you're if
you wanna do a a

52
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,760
a word I'll from somewhere you're not
supposed to be throwing the phone can

53
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,040
palm pilots are so she can I pay 25 for
50 bucks for one

54
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,870
but the word I learned a phone can walk
away if it gets stolen who cares if not

55
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,810
you come back in a week and you have
your prefix can do whatever so

56
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,909
kinda cool um you can either grab it
from the loft website

57
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:09,970
or come up here afterwards I can be mean
to you there's a few other applications

58
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,390
that are

59
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,069
beam to you as well if you have a collar
palm definitely come see me

60
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,729
I'm not going to talk about what I have
but it's a brand new program only works

61
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:18,668
on color palms

62
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:22,419
is called blue balls so I'll leave it at
that

63
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:26,479
so so my current research projects

64
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,760
I am summer you may have seen an
advisory that I recently released

65
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,130
on the Aladdin eat ok in which the USB
hardware token

66
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,479
I have one in my pocket but they're
kinda small

67
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,419
you want to display it there we go to
tiny

68
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:46,010
tiny a a little embedded system I'm
connects the USB port on the PC

69
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,800
and what it does basically it's it's
meant for authentication at stores

70
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,470
a.m. private data credentials anything
you want really x5 and I certificates

71
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,120
on 10 supposed to be this private thing
that proves you are who you are

72
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,630
so having this thing its is two factor
authentication

73
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,830
having this thing a physical device and
knowing the pin number which protects

74
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,530
the data

75
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,270
that supposed to prove you are
unfortunately is not exactly

76
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,740
that simple um there's a problem with

77
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,630
the Aladdin you talkin a the was the
actual before I say that

78
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,680
the these things are are simple embedded
systems

79
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,210
the components on the board are a piece
a cake to probe and kind of

80
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,109
experiment with which made it such an
easy target there's not really any kinda

81
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,380
tamper

82
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,580
evidence or tamper resistance on these
things he can open the thing up really

83
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,400
easily

84
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,900
clip onto the chips and do all sorts
experimentation with it

85
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:46,120
um so for the e talkin all the data is
protected by one pin number

86
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,080
it's an eight by value um what these
guys

87
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,479
did though is they left it default then

88
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,070
so it default login a string basically
they left that

89
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,469
programmed into the external memory
device have every single device

90
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,949
so regardless of what the user says the
pin number two

91
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:07,830
all you have to do is open the device
read the external memory

92
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,320
a move that one default string from its
known address which is always fixed

93
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,630
into the usurping area and you can log
right in

94
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,840
with the default password grab all the
private information at a bit

95
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,289
I am get everything out of it that data

96
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:25,630
that legitimate user had in there so
that's a big problem

97
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,350
and I'm look for another advisory coming
out

98
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,650
in about a week on a a similar product

99
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,590
actually a competitor's product that's
also USB hardware token and they did the

100
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,940
same thing so

101
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,280
getting into the the hardware side of
security products as a lot of things and

102
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,000
there's a lot of problems that could be
exploited

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,090
a but we can also help the vendors

104
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,120
by fixing their products and have
products that we can actually use and

105
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,650
feel good about using

106
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,030
I'm so kinda who all this thing was a
cypress

107
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,350
a see why seven-c_ 63,000 what that is
is just a a general purpose

108
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,870
microprocessor

109
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,550
which had USB support on board um

110
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,139
there's not that many processors right
now that have USB supports its kinda

111
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:11,590
easy to target that particular processor
get any kind of

112
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,810
information I needed on in development
kits and stuff like that

113
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,770
am and any use an Atmel CREE prom as the
external memory so that's

114
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,380
as some people know it's extremely easy
to read those things is no

115
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,440
protection of any sort I am and these
guys did encrypt any a

116
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,449
their data on there so I could easily
just change that pin

117
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,620
I'm and access other day that's that's
not working on now

118
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,660
I am there's a technical white paper
that I'm putting out pretty soon

119
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,270
it describes all the attacks that we
tried on these keys and some work some

120
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,299
didn't

121
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,600
both from hardware electrical point of
view and also mechanical attacks and

122
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,090
software attack so

123
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,729
keep your eyes open for that and a

124
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:53,240
that's it for me so government take it
away

125
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,620
yo yo word

126
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,599
right now occurring this

127
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,770
these allies are pretty about me I'm a
philadelphia-based acker for

128
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,039
background are pinching what's pretty
much true I

129
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:12,610
my main area of expertise is judiciary
been are hardware design

130
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,060
%uh and drinking which

131
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:23,160
if anyone was at the bar last night I
apologize for anything I've said

132
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,979
a I know those carried back to a room

133
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:31,969
yes i pod us that people the room to I A

134
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,069
the but anyway i woke up today
thankfully

135
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:39,218
and my mini expertise has been
judicially our hardware

136
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,400
I'll and specifically meant kicker
expand

137
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,860
and SHF a our website

138
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,250
particularly amplifiers I along with

139
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,300
the actual particulars over us but
spectrum systems

140
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,500
and I think along those lines I move
more into

141
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,980
now digital logic design I'm working on
team to design a very fast very cheap

142
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,910
supercomputer

143
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,699
a I can't give any details on it goes on
by the government

144
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:09,630
and so where they should also be sold to
the general public as well

145
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,329
I my main areas enters has been I'll a
central issue our communication systems

146
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:18,920
and a a.m. to rate a pass it as well

147
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,479
I along with the july design and digital
our Design

148
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,550
that's about a exit if if

149
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,790
we each have topic so yes further about
a

150
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,209
can't know is just being myself
yesterday I for another coal things

151
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:33,750
about

152
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,209
why spread spectrum is a little more
inherently secure then

153
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:40,230
their communication media I along with

154
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,600
what it means I am and

155
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,089
some issues regarding why we don't
really have very high data rate

156
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,550
a the S l's until recently what

157
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,230
what DSLR she dies why it's important
issue be difficult

158
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,440
allowing us to have very high data rate
radio a to everyone and mobile situation

159
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,660
or have

160
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,010
a a very underground digital a network

161
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,819
which were growing it done that start
setup are working very hard to work so

162
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,790
the issue to running into it that

163
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,790
so I guess the

164
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,860
his Brian oblivion here

165
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,610
Ryan low right I guess

166
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,209
will take questions so

167
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:30,550
yeah um deftly up to a microphone here
for people to ask questions

168
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,630
yeah okay Hobbit has one the guy with
the tie dye

169
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,519
I'm the other happy with the tie dye

170
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,269
um yet if you have any actual action I
saw somebody in El

171
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:45,740
elevator this morning they had some
telephone equipment they're gonna bring

172
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,510
here

173
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,750
I am yep stand-up bring it up if you
guys have stuff you can either stand in

174
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,339
line to raise their hand or whatever

175
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:56,500
really informal so I don't know I mean
you don't have to sit there

176
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,870
you can't answer something

177
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,839
and I if do we have another camera that
we can like zoom in on the stuff and put

178
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,829
it up on that

179
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:10,860
on the non-existent projected screener

180
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,480
that way everybody in the room can see
it if it's small

181
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,480
no are not prepared for that okay

182
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,190
so this is a silver box

183
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,330
you passes around two and we're done
chasm its kinda

184
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:37,330
weird-looking hours

185
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,200
yeah of

186
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:09,050
ish

187
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:16,050
yet what it looks like from the top this
is a

188
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:26,370
made by TSgt but never heard a its
technical service group

189
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,700
I'm this is not the Gemini system to it
and what it looks like there's a buncha

190
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,940
configuration stuff on the front a

191
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,050
initial rate for PlayStation five cents
ten cents twenty cents forty cents

192
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,150
play reappoint relay coin mechanism type
line type

193
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,680
future enhancements looks like it's it's
a device it's actually in the paper on

194
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,070
that

195
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,820
that either I don't know that the real
name a bit but it will

196
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,090
it will take the money and basically in
Anna

197
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:56,330
know that anybody feels here

198
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,980
fired all

199
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:06,660
yes

200
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:13,560
he's old

201
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:20,560
us

202
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:33,309
0 cool

203
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,660
your look at this

204
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,810
brand oblivion I showed up gonna come up

205
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,250
start

206
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:49,250
I area said

207
00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:57,439
and there'd

208
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,980
the best

209
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:31,980
sure

210
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:42,100
here

211
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,089
X

212
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:54,460
yeah

213
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,620
its sleaze

214
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:06,620
Austin one up

215
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,800
okay us

216
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,319
okay well um yes will pass this around
it

217
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:22,899
I guess the people showing hardware is a
little harder than I thought

218
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:26,550
um if people two people have any real
questions

219
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:33,550
someone mentioned that apart by the
question okay

220
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,170
yes

221
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,649
men and

222
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:53,860
no hmmm sorry

223
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,009
yet next now um not at all

224
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:05,009
good yeah said

225
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,970
Riya other actuate this question dead
serious

226
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,860
a so let's talk about what OS CMA
specifically

227
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,300
city mayors a spread-spectrum tuning
other

228
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,640
re-read the question was hell a
sensitive is current solar technology

229
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,310
jamming specific why been jamming

230
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,370
aka the question was hell

231
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,480
help water boiler systems jamming up
joystick CDMA for example city mayors

232
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,590
nice test case

233
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,680
are no specific case because it's a
really are only

234
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,300
true spread spectrum a say our protocol
out there right now

235
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,210
what sprint spectrum means is you have
your incoming

236
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,380
will let sorry about 20 for a very
simplified version

237
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,630
a a months by both signal and

238
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,660
plus Bible signal so it's -1

239
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,240
only his your own one okay and use an
end to a mixer along with

240
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,579
a suitor encode which has a frequency
rate much higher that then your incoming

241
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,180
doughtery

242
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,390
what happens if you look at the power
spectral density is so much easier by

243
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,010
Helen overhead or wait for some shit
like that

244
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,800
you look at the power spectral density a
few regular single before spraying you

245
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,310
see a single spike come up

246
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,520
and some homes over the side due to the

247
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,090
a the variable frequency nature and the
square wave nature the actual doughtery

248
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,240
we look at sprint spectrum your power
spectral density is

249
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,510
don't much further out the status

250
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:43,620
as president ratio to the property at
that modulation format direct secret

251
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,220
specifically direct sequence spread
spectrum that see a Mac I am

252
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,760
and what happened as a result is that

253
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,010
if you want to if you look at the signal
a scope if the

254
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,260
a actual the difficulty rate above the
spreading sequences much greater than

255
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,740
out the actual data sequence

256
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,920
you'll to see no reason to skip
mathematically importantly

257
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,740
mathematically

258
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,140
your signal is it actually is very
similar in toys if you take an

259
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,700
autocorrelation I love your signal space

260
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,320
with itself for ok relations with Celtic
correlation ovett a

261
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,679
what actually looks like is it is very
very very narrow actual correlation area

262
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,020
which site which is a sign that a is
very much clothes in noise and then

263
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,120
no signal nor signals or correlation
itself is just one spike

264
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,930
at that the tally 0 what this means up

265
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,020
okay is that unless you have the exact

266
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,420
PN sequence on the other end you never
be all get back

267
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,410
recovery ritual signal the PN sequences
are designed to be completely worth

268
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,500
backing of each other

269
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,230
so that if you try to generate another
sequence is not exactly the same

270
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:53,320
a a a number of convolution reaction at
nags acquiescing coalition to each

271
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,100
but medical shit a at the same each

272
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,270
data bit you never be overcome the
original signal now

273
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,480
was interesting if you tried jamming a
standard aspects Beckham system with a

274
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,260
single tone

275
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,770
a narrow pretend like you let's say you
want to jam zone on walkie talkie

276
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,330
Ukiah upland exactly what's the use in
the same modulation format with a lot

277
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,000
more power

278
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,960
because the way spread spectrum works
that GM's jamming signals is spread

279
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,900
itself fluorescence signals the spread

280
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,110
so if you actually look at the power
spectral density after the mixer

281
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,130
which differ dis pressure signal a weird
signal

282
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,990
you'll see you're reducing oh and your
interferes very Broadbent

283
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:37,610
right so why isn't there a bit the
actuals a single Spyker and there've

284
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,870
been jimmy is very difficult

285
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:43,860
why been jamming is a I was impractical
because the power considerations

286
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,560
your Jerry you know if the integrator
that that I read that him out

287
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,889
you know power you have to be on a dump
in turn to when our power you have to be

288
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,190
eligible for power gym decision or get
up to get her to use a

289
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:00,260
class runs or or power transistors but
the power considerations are exceeding

290
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,290
yes Park caps a head

291
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:07,490
but video profits at again it is you not
to go get the power you need to do it

292
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,090
arm intention point that was brought up

293
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,429
kinda recently a someone ahead this
thing as it meets

294
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:18,230
suck dot I am about the idea ever
jamming a satellite

295
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,250
on the way workers by Jerry a large a

296
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,710
a single frequency power spike and what
there was dissent the front and the

297
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,570
receiver I want to explain what that
means why is actually important

298
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,100
and why a what you were doing this now I
am

299
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:37,040
basically our front enable fires are
receivers have a very narrow dynamic

300
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,610
range

301
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,429
to allow time to fit a low noise
amplifier were narrow a response they

302
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:42,520
respect the jammer

303
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,550
and when you generate a very large a

304
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,980
single frequency very narrow Pam with
signal

305
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:54,220
very high power arm if forces the front
and amplifier what's called

306
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,130
1tb compression are forced into
compression and what happens at the game

307
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,510
that infers reduced see reducing know
you try receive

308
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,530
actually gets dumped biggest push
further for that the noise for

309
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,510
jack cheese possible by Jerry enough
power you get exploited

310
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,710
the properties love up receiver
technology and and therefore effectively

311
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,610
JM

312
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,540
a a a spread spectrum signal but the
prior best way do something like this

313
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,530
would be a very

314
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,970
a narrow beam with antenna point
somewhere close to receiver

315
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,330
I'll with a local a receiver to the
Capri

316
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:33,330
definitely seaver is dare to question

317
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,480
no on next X

318
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,500
own

319
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,870
like good

320
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:51,280
are painted

321
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,940
Mahan I was hoping you would ask that
question

322
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,230
um no I haven't done anything with box
accidents

323
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,780
some we ran out of the the lockbox eg
kids back in late ninety

324
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,168
8 97 or something um

325
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:10,890
I gotta give up on parks at I thought
flex was gonna kinda

326
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,490
come in and take it away a probably

327
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,510
I don't really have a favorite method
now but

328
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:22,200
if I were to do it again i probably use
maybe like a a pic processor

329
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,900
I am have a portable box a daughter just
write some software with the pic

330
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,850
maybe external circuitry if I needed um
to have a actual

331
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,440
portable box like to go to maybe look it
up to

332
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,289
a to a pager so take the the
discriminator output from the pager the

333
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:38,870
actual

334
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:43,640
unfiltered on signal from the pager into
this

335
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,830
whatever circuit a but I would probably
wouldn't do with the laptop or anything

336
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,840
made with the Palm Pilot

337
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,889
have secretary does have a serial input
into the palm pilot or something like

338
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,429
that

339
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:55,600
go go ahead

340
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,600
I can this

341
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,380
spell it

342
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,670
for now as a buddy here that here yet
doing it

343
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:21,670
units went to up to anybody know and
wants to explain what it is

344
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:32,179
yeah aired virgins in there somewhere so
it's a

345
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:35,429
okay so it's a net appliance like the
eye opener

346
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:42,380
where okay it uses a

347
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:49,380
Cyrus chipset with the would you say I D
okay

348
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:58,630
I'm sure it's possible go-ahead

349
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,950
others say it did because I've actual
manufacturer have a complete

350
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:06,330
writer system is so extremely high that
no one does

351
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:10,770
so it's all a bit of shopping analogies
additionally the Casa doing anything

352
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,080
that would

353
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,408
of you skate something would add so much
would have more time

354
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:17,740
the actual production costs and the
actual design costs out no one ever does

355
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,360
this

356
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,840
you are very rarely do it now then they
do with the eyeopener age but top oxy on

357
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,889
it then I mean an

358
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:28,510
that was their idea obfuscation or you
know for being a painter but depends on

359
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,220
the ID card or by the flipper

360
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,230
price on the most convenient for them
when you're actually manufacturing

361
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:33,850
aboard

362
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,730
so I think be pretty easy reader yeah
definitely another point with the

363
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,820
manufacturing cost is the manufactures

364
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,230
up these boards need to be other test
them a and I'm sure they're not gonna

365
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,289
want to develop their whole test
fixtures just a

366
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:48,320
you know for this one cheap proprietary
product

367
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,418
so it's probably just from my
understanding the eye opener was just

368
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:52,020
standard

369
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,590
motherboard stuff obfuscated with proxy
covered any party whatever

370
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,668
um so I'm pretty sure that would be the
same if

371
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:03,409
if you know where to buy 'em sure the
people would want to know from the

372
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:04,380
Virgin website

373
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,450
your yeah

374
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,500
you can guess I want your probably come
up with some other fun sites at same

375
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,010
time

376
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:19,010
um there's a question over here I just
wonder if you've messed around with

377
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,090
and compared the visor hardware to the
actual

378
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:26,780
hardware because I've noticed that the
visor a running with the same OS runs a

379
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,770
helluva lot faster than the palm does

380
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:32,168
everything times when what you don't
that's a good question there's

381
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:35,429
um the visor is a new PA that's

382
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:38,890
made by hand spring which is actually
company formed by Jeff Hawkins

383
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:42,740
who is the founder of um pump computing
are the pilot

384
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,720
back in the day a there's one here it
looks strikingly similar to the Palm

385
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,110
Pilot is actually bigger

386
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,309
and a a little more bulky um

387
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:55,960
what the hand spring is is basically
it's

388
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,070
it's a standard Palm Pilot but is made
by those other company it runs

389
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:04,260
um a ROM version of Palm OS 3.3

390
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,299
up most the palm pilots now have Flash
robs you can upgrade the software

391
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:12,399
these visors are stuck at OS 3.3
currently

392
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:16,250
um their hardware their poor design is
different a

393
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,360
but it operates just the same I think
the visors have

394
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,450
um so the palm pilots and the the palm
up to the palms 3

395
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,320
run on the Dragon Ball 6328 is the
Motorola processor

396
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,299
to 60,000 compatible I'm I think from
the three

397
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,730
to the are from above the 32

398
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,419
maybe like the seven they use the drag
about easy processor which is just a an

399
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:42,610
enhancement of that it kinda takes away
some %uh the unused functionality

400
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,760
above the 6328 and is a little cheaper

401
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,710
a.m. it's also a little bit faster and I
think that's what the visor uses

402
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,070
now there's also a 68 328 VZ which just
came out and I'm not sure if it's in any

403
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,850
devices

404
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:00,289
yet possibly the part 3 see which is the
color version that

405
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:03,549
the the the BCE is has

406
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:07,940
has a PLL for for up getting up to
thirty three megahertz the system clock

407
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,620
which is

408
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,899
basically twice as fast as the palm
pilots were or 16 points 7 megahertz

409
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:18,140
okay so the the part 3 C's

410
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,899
compare bones be to the visor I've just
been told but

411
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:26,460
basically everything that runs on the
Palm OS platform from

412
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,980
first 3.3 is gonna run on any any bomb
was platform

413
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,580
the good thing about the hands bring
device if you go to handspring dot com

414
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,600
they have an expansion port in the back
which is

415
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,240
totally hackable a what it is it is a
bunch of

416
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,169
direct connects to summit the I'm I'll
ports and some other

417
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:47,850
the port circuitry in pins on the Dragon
Ball a

418
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,860
which makes it nice the original palm
pilots only had a serial port

419
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,330
and there's only so much you can do with
the serial port without having

420
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:59,678
external circuits here come some CDC
stickers I think thanks that veggie

421
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,860
feel free to come up here to answer some
questions with us

422
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:08,070
um so this this spring board module they
call it is this expansion port

423
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,350
on the handspring on the visors and

424
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:15,730
its it's amazing there's a bunch away
papers up on Hans bring site you can

425
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,190
make

426
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,940
custom circuit boards a to basically do
whatever you want I think they have an

427
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,000
mp3 player

428
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,190
currently out they have a camera a.m.

429
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,370
basic consumer applications but you
could basically do whatever you want

430
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,159
with that

431
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,159
they also have some that just have a
flash on board see you can

432
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,620
right software gonna disturb you like a
cartridge am

433
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,210
so much a really wide want to do that
because it's going to cost a lot of

434
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,200
money

435
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,450
but definitely take a look at the
answering device if you wanted

436
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:48,230
to do any kind of hardware modifications
and also action on that note the par-3

437
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,409
axe I believe made by yes a one for me

438
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:57,230
'em the palm 3x also has an expansion
port but is not really defined as well

439
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:57,889
as the

440
00:28:57,889 --> 00:29:03,680
springboard module

441
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,769
yeah

442
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:09,169
all right way where you get thrown out
you guys gonna do something cool

443
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:13,860
right what are you a have a really good
questions are a few

444
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,879
dancer like pop your eyeballs out or
something where's the guy that was

445
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:19,889
rapping at the

446
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:26,110
at the movie last night I wanna see him
go get a ser with that

447
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:30,600
you have a do-over Newton story to share
yeah

448
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,950
your way you aren't saying

449
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:40,610
if you do sink in we'll give you one but
I get a shirt

450
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:47,610
whatever you want who is the mic

451
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,399
0

452
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,830
well good

453
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,379
mired 0 yes

454
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,309
oh yeah those um you wanna join talk
about this

455
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:08,730
might okay microchip is a is a company
that makes some

456
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,940
a budget different integrated circuit
circuits a

457
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,070
their pic processors a general-purpose
processor

458
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,220
a they're really cheap they're available
everywhere

459
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,679
um yet we haven't forgot about the
shirts

460
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,039
we'd issues have to pay attention now
like school

461
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:30,510
should yea right if you stay quiet then
you get a ser

462
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm yet so so the pic processors are

463
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,500
are really cheap you can get them um
from digi-key a

464
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,600
digital com I'm basically any electronic
store

465
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,090
I've done %uh a lot of development with
the mostly for like our projects

466
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:47,370
so I have things that I use a
multi-color LED in like change that

467
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,110
color the LED every minute in

468
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:53,260
just do some stupid art stuff with that
up there really easy to program they

469
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,679
have development kits that are like

470
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,299
maybe 20 bucks 29 bucks so it's
something that

471
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:03,110
that students can use it as a portable
enough well-received

472
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,230
old

473
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:09,970
sees hip

474
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:15,740
up

475
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,429
art

476
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:24,629
saw up

477
00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:30,850
art

478
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,080
old

479
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,480
um no the I don't think they're ever
gonna go away totally from

480
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,380
OOTP um it yet depends on the
application

481
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,880
if you actually want flash and it's also
developing

482
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,030
a integrated circuits with Flash
technology is still more expensive than

483
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:48,730
0 TP

484
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,160
um and if you're not going to want to
reprogram your system

485
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,600
a you have no DP part what people
usually do is they do development with

486
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,940
the flashvars they can

487
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,179
keep on reprogramming the firmware as
they're doing development then when they

488
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:03,620
go in as production they just get around
version

489
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,020
I'm have microchip program at their
manufacturing plant

490
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,600
send them to the vendor whose
manufacturing with that already

491
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,240
programmed

492
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:17,440
okay well

493
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,450
heard right want

494
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:30,450
head

495
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:35,490
yet yeah they do have the UB parts which
you race with

496
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,650
UV light as the name would imply um

497
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,850
it does take like 10 to 20 minutes I I
don't know how much those are gonna go

498
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,350
away

499
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:49,720
um I'm sure people as a good news about
class is definitely more convenient for

500
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,350
development and also if you wanted the
firmware upgrades on your product

501
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:56,280
anything else

502
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,149
I mean it devil give a specific question
about that I mean using Flash

503
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:05,110
yeah I mean it really depends on a
product is

504
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:10,410
anymore

505
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,450
works well website

506
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:20,450
production me

507
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:41,920
range

508
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,110
yes

509
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:06,860
used

510
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,389
this

511
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:17,389
the Atmel 8535 is what

512
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:30,449
okay 512k: I love avram okay

513
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:37,449
it about it okay or 512 ate a flash in
512 bytes around okay

514
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,970
and thats a generous that's another
general purpose i processor

515
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:45,110
cool and that's Atmel

516
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:49,749
about to come

517
00:34:49,749 --> 00:34:56,749
what what the to the programming
interface you want to know

518
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:05,820
this

519
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,890
0

520
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,930
a lot a lot of the a lot of the chips
that have a flash

521
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,100
are are definitely serial protocols some
of them are standards like

522
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,210
here yes step it's gonna be serial for
the most part

523
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:25,210
um and whatever it is it's you you get

524
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:28,380
there's data sheets that would provide
that information on the timing see could

525
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,100
either build it

526
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,330
development system yourself or just use
one but it's gonna be standard serial

527
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,850
which

528
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:40,990
much actual

529
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:47,990
hitch yes

530
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:54,290
also from work on some stuff

531
00:35:54,290 --> 00:36:01,119
he more

532
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,500
the air

533
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:11,500
let's hear it well

534
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:18,610
us

535
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,820
this

536
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:37,820
hillside

537
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,730
us his

538
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,750
this

539
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,000
opens process just

540
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,009
his

541
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:54,059
this yes

542
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:57,579
his office his

543
00:36:57,579 --> 00:37:04,320
him sold

544
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,720
fine he's on a hard

545
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,910
someone's of aren't

546
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:14,799
by SeaWorld so

547
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,330
along or its

548
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:23,799
problems here's so

549
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,040
or number of that this

550
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,930
fast his

551
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:36,960
his

552
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,920
it's difficult as months all they don't

553
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,380
higher this moment

554
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,490
prime was

555
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:57,730
said

556
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,180
as

557
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:05,180
questions I was the mic

558
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:13,700
closest to

559
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:21,660
all

560
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,399
right

561
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,220
all yes

562
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,650
rise

563
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:35,020
all come without knowing exactly what it
does that sound a little strange

564
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:39,820
um do you know what what type a low
level stuff P he did

565
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:45,700
lines

566
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,820
um it net now I actually did a

567
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,520
another I did I designed a medical
device based around the 6328

568
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,720
'em that actually used infrared

569
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,190
a and and if the all the infrared

570
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,320
poor is on the Dragon Balls is the UART
a.m.

571
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,150
and the infrared it just has date output
at 3:16 bit rate which is something that

572
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,850
the infrared transceiver looking to use

573
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:12,680
um by doing if that's really what he did
I wouldn't see how that would actually

574
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,359
damage anything other than maybe

575
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,860
maybe crash the OS is something which
you could just reset but I don't think

576
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,990
it would damage the hardware because
it's just gonna

577
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,990
I miss is gonna drop our this its

578
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:30,990
yes

579
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,010
of

580
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:40,020
yeah

581
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,210
yeah I mean in lessee clobbered the
classroom government or the classroom

582
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,880
but I don't know if you have a web page

583
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,270
you know it you know you are up and I
okay

584
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:52,759
what you can email to me and if if
anyone else is interested send me e-mail

585
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,040
I King panel of DICOM and uploaded on

586
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:01,820
that that would be interesting to know
writers

587
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:08,820
more questions good

588
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,790
on old

589
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,770
or

590
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,439
well

591
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:23,009
nope

592
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:30,010
should

593
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:32,569
week yeah I think we will he say
something on this

594
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:35,630
um a lot of times it when I've been were
dialing

595
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:39,420
a there are a lot of systems that don't
come up with anything um

596
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,039
it could really be any type of device in
it you know not

597
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:46,819
not every device looked up to modem is
going to have an identification string

598
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,699
a it might have some it might be
expecting some weird control characters

599
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:52,640
to turn it on I'm not sure there's one

600
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,219
generic way to identify anyone system
a.m.

601
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:59,299
and if it doesn't identify itself in
some ways you know it's basically

602
00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:00,229
impossible to know

603
00:41:00,229 --> 00:41:07,229
unless you actually get it to their site
somehow and see what is connected

604
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:19,039
good yet used

605
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:22,269
using or

606
00:41:22,269 --> 00:41:26,920
all

607
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,930
action but my understanding of the craft
terminals where they were

608
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:36,000
they just had like um macros basically
so it was still you connect

609
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,550
300 bar 200 baht or whatever the crap
terminal was the crafter roses big

610
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,290
yellow

611
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:43,940
lineman handset with the display and
everything it's like a a fancy

612
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,390
do we have wanted alright

613
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:51,640
someone has I guess on the other side
but if they can waive it rather be cool

614
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,730
um yeah my understanding is that they
just used

615
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:58,510
a macros so if anything it's just gonna
be

616
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:02,130
you no strings up control characters or
something so maybe if you can muck

617
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,380
monitor what those are

618
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:07,200
maybe with like an RS 232 analyzer are
not not I see them to

619
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,350
a.m. Sat I guess something called up the
phone line

620
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:14,319
if you can analyze those strings that
you might be a little to recreate that

621
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,430
with the terminal program

622
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:22,430
or said

623
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:26,680
it yeah I'm if you're ambitious enough
here

624

724
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:18,259
palm gear dot com I that s most like a
software site

third-party application site but but
they also have like a new section there

were people will announce their hardware
products and stuff

727
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:27,899

probably the wire head

748
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:02,610
a 35 hurts mute are really low signal

749
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:05,910
that that is really really slow and the

750
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:10,000
you not got the worry too much about me

for your system dry then adjust
retransmission my models

752
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:16,470
a and what I mean

753
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:19,830
what exactly that means you not picking

I mean II radeon0: every book did he use
different interpretation verified

757
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:33,690
hikers because we know it down to 35 her
story and

758
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:37,260
and ways it turn normal peak to peak or
something like that you

759
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,390
I so your own should be or just
