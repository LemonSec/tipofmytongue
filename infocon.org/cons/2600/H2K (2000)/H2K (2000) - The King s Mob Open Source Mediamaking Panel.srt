open-source media

8
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,630
how is really important enough

9
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,230
breaking down the

10
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,120
so it's like a hierarchy we have going
on right now in the media

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,620
analogy to create your own media has
lots of uh...

12
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,620
my mother was on before this about
information being free or not free and

13
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,710
however we are close to the
privatization

14
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,960
information and uh... celibate

is really important

17
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,470
there's been a lot of talk so far about
the two money back and stuff like that

18
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,490
tom was the how the american government
is involved in the north talk bout how

19
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,470
he transnational corporations and the
international organizations are behind a

20
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,060
lot of it

21
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,710
uh... we have some footage

22
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,850
from the world trade organization

23
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,570

we have since dot here

28
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,100
but we are running so far behind
schedule

29
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,090
uh... i think that we might

30
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,369
does not do it unless

31
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:59,520
everyone really wants to see stuff

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,908
necessary right now

33
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:03,910

personal experience and the information

38
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,680
i've been able to dig up so if anyone

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,819

anything that i say

40

video

52
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:49,969

53
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,969
by two different organizations wants
paper tiger

54
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:54,970
which is a local public access

55
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,680
uh... network

56
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,739
who worked with indymedia center

57
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,610
i don't know if you know that how they
work but they go to all the different

58
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,759
protests and they were on a twenty
four-hour editing service

59
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:08,339
it's sort of a workshop where everything
for her industry with their t_v_ cameras

60
00:03:08,339 --> 00:03:09,599
and what not

61
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,649
income at the end of day and drop off
the case and they added stuff together

62
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:13,889
as it goes

63
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:17,900
so working again so we all saw on the
daily news are absent c_n_n_

64
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,959
which was a

65
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,399
nothing to do with what was actually
happening there

66
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:27,019
paper tiger is non-profit uh... we also
have something from pick ax reductions

67
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:30,979
which is basically just a bunch of media
savvy kids to job footage added together

68
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,659
got it out

69
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:36,259
distributed on v_h_s_ you know just
passing around stuff like that um... all

70
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:39,559
the footage together the three hours so
these are just what sent

71
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:41,409
try a little bit sensationalistic

72
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:44,289
you know it's a lot of healthy kids
often stuff

73
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:46,840

or citizenry

126
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:05,370
that relate to

127
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,510
lawyer

128
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,740
well

129
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,860
okay so that was seattle

130
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:23,470
had a lot of using footage like already

131
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,480
family seemed basically any doubt while
the spelling out i had no idea

132
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,910
and consultancy at all

133
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,250
uh... couple weeks later i got some of
these tapes and just blew my mind at

134
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,590
that went on

135
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:38,150
in a couple weeks worth of mainstream
media so nothing

136
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,110
webster

137
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,160
dictionary defines capitalism aswin

138
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,170
private businesses only means of
production distribution

139
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,110
anand casa competition

140
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,530
defines communism

141
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,110
as a means of production distribution
being owned by the government and

142
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,390
socialism

143
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:59,000
as those means being owned by the people

144
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,100
basically we think that we live in the
capitalists

145
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,060
society but no it's not really what we
live in because those means

146
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,340
really owned by a a very very select few

147
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,400
transnational corporations

148
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,229
give us our media and get us

149
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:17,059
all the information that we pretty much
have access to now the intent has

150
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:17,939
changed that

151
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,820
this is all

152
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,620
puts from threats email

153
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,840
uh... brett was made by the king's mob
multimedia militia two four-year

154
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,430
can stop it

155
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,100
so four-year process uh...

156
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,029
taking place

157
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:31,470
per million new york

158
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,150
berlin london

159
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,270
uh... parts of

160
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,350
and all across the country

161
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,930
the u_s_ that is

162
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,460
uh... with the way that we're on our
company is

163
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:47,620
we don't work with hollywood or any
major corporations one point

164
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,709
about independent film which is why i
don't really think it's valid

165
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:51,630
against eh...

166
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,660
say something that we're introducing men
introducing that sort of redefining

167
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,260
studio yourself film

168
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,460
allowed guilt about blair witch project

169
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,620
i want to chat about those guys at
school now

170
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,850
but as being independent film

171
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,880
because artisan distributed it is not
part of a studio however artisan is

172
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,550
almost entirely on by jason hadn't bank

173
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,090
david rockefeller and you know

174
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,520
marta pride biggest

175
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,800
governing bodies even if it's not
governmental uh... so what we try and do

176
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,900
is we try and deal with the fact that

177
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,400
well we're moving towards and we offered
a when george bush was the president was

178
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,920
a new world order

179
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,310
and the ruled by the

180
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,020
massive corporations

181
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,019
and uh...

182
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,350
we're trying to push independent
awakened as the idiot studios something

183
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,940
that transnational switches where
something like w_t_o_ becomes involved

184
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,380
the w_t_o_ is not part of

185
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,200
any government it is

186
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,870
larger than the government's by the
people that you see that they were

187
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,900
trying to stop promoting its the
sheraton building

188
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,699
are not

189
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:53,520
elected officials

190
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,810
they're appointed by the different
governments

191
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,270
do you represent the governmental
interests

192
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,040
insofar as representing the

193
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,569
dictates of the corporate interests

194
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,670
and that let's talk a little bit about
the w_t_o_ giving example basically have

195
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,220
a work let's say for example that

196
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,250
the u_s_ factory farms

197
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,730
you know plane doctor frankenstein with
their hormones and whatnot beacon bigger

198
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,060
juicier

199
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,830
candles and chickens

200
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,240
and say the european union does not want
to import

201
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,100
that disgusting beef

202
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,910
livestock

203
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,929
well be factory farm corporations in the
u_s_

204
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:34,910
really want the european union to bother

205
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,219
factory farm animal so they bring it to
the w_t_o_

206
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,130
so now we have dispute mister trade
dispute

207
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,439
and the w_t_o_

208
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,699
will come in and issue a ruling
completely secretly we don't know

209
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:46,870
anything about it

210
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,900
all this is extremely secret which is
part of the reason why it when i start

211
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,820
this thing to be so that's my
information is limited

212
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,170
i'm sure many of you have come across
other information someone here from you

213
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,059
because

214
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:59,170
today did not see any information at all

215
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,470
my understanding of it in this case

216
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,250
is that the w_t_o_ found a favor of the
factory farms

217
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,010
and the number that i heard

218
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,450
you can call me on the fact that if i'm
not sure this is there a number

219
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,200
but i've heard that it's two hundred
billion dollars the european union this

220
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,120
fund

221
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,560
until they agreed to take the beef in
michael s or not

222
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,670
but that is basically a m

223
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,820
very secretive information about how
much it was the way that i found about

224
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,010
this stuff is that there's a book called
whose trade organization

225
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,310
came out about a year ago

226
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,480
i think that we have a copy of it over
there or capital path with this time

227
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,340
and wants to see

228
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,250
uh... dot a month ago i tried to get a
copy arbitron amazon dot com

229
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,850
barnesandnoble dot com at barnes and
noble you can get it

230
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,459
thread for did this

231
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:48,080
by check again it is available so i
don't know what happened the past month

232
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,770
the change that because it came out over
a year ago

233
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,329
at the height of all this was almost
impossible to get

234
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,460
other of the w_t_o_ precedence

235
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,040
well basically that the woman ari cited
about the factory farms

236
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,660
the agreement there is the

237
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,240
cemetery and phytosanitary agreement
sounds kinda random what it basically is

238
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,240
is

239
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,450
that corporations no longer have to
prove that their food is safe

240
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,230
the burden of proof

241
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,839
falls on the nations to prove beyond a
shadow of a doubt that it is

242
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,060
absolutely harmful

243
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,198
uh...

244
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,649
obviously it's unfair corporations
another instant one is the technical

245
00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:27,400
barriers to trade agreement

246
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,020
this means that nations may not refuse
importing any products

247
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,539
for any reason except for the commercial
value

248
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:38,559
basically it is mister marshall value
meaning it how expensive it was so it's

249
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,420
a there's a lot of clothing

250
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,070
that you don't want import because it's
more expensive as another line of

251
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,860
clothing that they don't support that

252
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,840
but you can't not imported because it's

253
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,799
produced by

254
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,658
seven-year-olds in rwanda being p two
cents an hour let's not ok when we have

255
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:54,640
to let all that stuff

256
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,659
and the one that's very important

257
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,770
at this convention

258
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,950
is the trips agreement which still a via
fermenting yesterday at the trade

259
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,820
related aspects of intellectual property

260
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,340
pariah

261
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,110
that was done in conjunction with the w
i_p_o_

262
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,890
prison though are you familiar w i_p_o_s
the world intellectual property

263
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,890
organization

264
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,419
they're the ones that brought us the
international statute

265
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,750
which the digital millennium act is
based on

266
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,419
it support the plan update on what
impact

267
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:27,390
is an american act but it is only us

268
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:32,590
taking part in b overarching

269
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,350
but the w i_p_o_ instituted and stated
all governments must have an act like

270
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,580
this if you're gonna be part of the
structure

271
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,850
w i_p_o_s part of the u_n_

272
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,720
as are the i_m_f_ and the world bank

273
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,510
another thing that sanction to look at
is the police there he saw a bunch of

274
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,750
different ones uh... they liked the way
that the filmmakers juxtapose the

275
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,270
seattle police force national guard with
the brinks security

276
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,830
let me know to bring some of it there

277
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,590
very privatized top-level security

278
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,020
but basically we could have is

279
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,030
a clandestine group

280
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,850
international

281
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,290
uh... the lead

282
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,760
who want to have a meeting and are being
protected from the american people

283
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,050
by our own armed forces

284
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,139
to the point where our police

285
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,830
archer guessing a shooting us with
rubber bullets in from concussion

286
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,049
grenades at us because we don't want
this meeting in our city

287
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:25,110
and that's an interesting point and
another point that's important is that

288
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,610
we end up fighting with the police on
the street or like the guy pointed out

289
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,190
just you know working-class men and
women

290
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,310
there's no reason why we should be
fighting with them

291
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,510
i think that the point is they brought
up here up activism and a summit of the

292
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,690
first day

293
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,030
that unless you're willing to not be not
missing go out and take personal

294
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,270
responsibility for everything then
you're just

295
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,020
teenager having fun or whatever

296
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,639
but that's out in my opinion that's
bullshit

297
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,120
because activism can really go to the
source if you go in you packed every day

298
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,830
then you are a perfect in p economics
there

299
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,879
which the only get a fucked up an
opportunity to be a top

300
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,180
it's not really

301
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,260
change anything i think that if

302
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,140
anything at all it's a very very
effective method protest

303
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,800
and of course has been pointed out as
well that

304
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,780
cannot muster the ratings go after the
small business owner in

305
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,210
steeped in a month

306
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,420
so let's talk a little bit about the
i_m_f_ i'm gonna show some footage from

307
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,070
that but um...

308
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,929
now when i was waiting

309
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:23,760
i was actually in d_c_ i happen to think
that c_ span is generally pretty good

310
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,158
and they were running twenty four hour
coverage of the event

311
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,929
uh... friend of mine p to farmington
about five or ten v_h_s_ tapes uh...

312
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,370
i've not watched them

313
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:39,370
but i have watched enough to see that
this is pretty much what it's like

314
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:46,950
take a moment to move

315
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,550
near the skies basically talking about

316
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,930
let's get it

317
00:20:53,930 --> 00:21:00,930
sum up efforts

318
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,280
we're loving organizing and girl i know
this is that the ellipse which was the

319
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,918
only legal parts of the process that has
kept our cameras here all day

320
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:19,330
in our family blog lose the committee
and protesting again

321
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,929
a lot of people would come here and
convert she talked about the other

322
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:27,130
actions in the street and they have set
them which you now is very useful and

through the book that we don't even more

that they have reinstall republican from

including the new year

467
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,200
for i think it was certainly we would
certainly proper

468
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,010
reassert was preventative and proactive
but the strategy was to get less to

469
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,450
hangout to decrease as on the streets

470
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,900
like part of the contents of the strong
leadership that was that that protest

needed more we debate what

476
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,889
but they still haven't been all it all
precipitated that six hundred people

477
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:12,880
gathered with the

478
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,830

479
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,510

besides sensory deprivation

486
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,370
and that the courtroom everything was a
sim card since

487
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,779
realizing there with their there

488
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:56,970
mistyped rankles running around and
readable car blood-like hop across the

more exciting to you

634
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,119
beyond reality

635
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:17,119
bigger than we did

636
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:29,749
spell as this demonstrates that d_c_
actually did get a lot more media

637
00:41:29,749 --> 00:41:31,210
venus' seattle tid

638
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:35,279

saying that this is

639
00:41:35,279 --> 00:41:37,469
non biased but i'm still here

640
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:38,559
however it does

641
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:41,449
show the other end to it so if
everyone's doing media that at least we

642
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:42,449
get it

643
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:46,989
the full story if we look for it rather
than just a story that those

644
00:41:46,989 --> 00:41:50,929
or disseminating admitted amounts give
us by the way this is the

645
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:54,780
uh... the pamphlet that's based on who's
trade organization book no one slip

646
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,139
attitude of the appear later

647
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:01,309
one of the things very different about
the d_c_ thing from the sierra thing is

648
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:05,759
that the actually is very easily turn
into a humanitarian issue and for the

649
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:06,659
media

650
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:08,819
to get new story there's a lot of

651
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:13,509
american g_a_t_t_ you care about third
world uh... and blah blah blah blah blah

652
00:42:13,509 --> 00:42:17,059
and want to help out you know poor
starving kids in

653
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:20,359
uh... wherever china and sore told arun

654
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:21,429
and uh...

655
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:24,549
and then you can you know show some
stuff for the black lock direct action c

656
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:28,479
discredited just enough and call them
violent even though the only bounce icy

657
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,269
for the most part is the police

658
00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:33,179
uh... whereas on the other hand

659
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:36,139
the w_t_o_ is

660
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:37,929
all about the corporate gender

661
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:42,889
and there's really no way to screen
footage and talk about

662
00:42:42,889 --> 00:42:46,619
went out in seattle without dealing with
the

663
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:48,729
issue at hand

664
00:42:48,729 --> 00:42:49,889
uh...

665
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:52,339
this really has no end to the government

666
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:55,899
and one of the things that illustrates
this best of all would be at the

667
00:42:55,899 --> 00:42:58,049
m_p_a_a_ uh...

668
00:42:58,049 --> 00:43:01,038
which if we think about these major
corporations they list a few them here

669
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:02,509
we think in the night

670
00:43:02,509 --> 00:43:04,779
at least them

671
00:43:04,779 --> 00:43:08,270
being competition with one another the
m_p_a_a_ is like a union

672
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,389
for your massive

673
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:10,919
make a corporate studios

674
00:43:10,919 --> 00:43:13,558
and if they really need to union

675
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:15,909
all this is really really important
right now

676
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:20,289
because we are at a pivotal point when
everything's changing

677
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:23,839
this stuff has been building for a long
time what's going on now is the

678
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,788
inevitable shift towards

679
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:29,319
whether or not it will become a hundred
percent instead of ninety percent

680
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:31,469
uh... thing that we push

681
00:43:31,469 --> 00:43:34,859
so it's a little earlier is that the i
why media

682
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:39,119
and the open-source uh... open-source
i'm sure many of you know

683
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,869
much more of the history of open source
than i did

684
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,169
but the way that we translate it to you

685
00:43:44,169 --> 00:43:46,479
media is that for the most part

686
00:43:46,479 --> 00:43:49,419
people don't know i wanna make a movie
okay

687
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:50,259
but how do you do now

688
00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:53,709
read a script in the new send it to an
agent of studio or something

689
00:43:53,709 --> 00:43:55,970
and uh... heavy distributed

690
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,219
nobody knows

691
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:02,699
there's a lot of information that is for
didn't kept it then

692
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:04,779
the halls of power

693
00:44:04,779 --> 00:44:07,730
uh... we definitely found that when we
start making threat

694
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:10,889
that's what it took us four years
instead of you know

695
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:12,579
for six months

696
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:16,020
so what we do is we go around the world
we do workshops and we

697
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,639
teach people how to do use media we like
to

698
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:20,869
uh... we're working towards the ability
to go

699
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:24,109
two different festivals with cameras for
kids shoot stuff

700
00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:27,479
and then let the music written it's
added together uploaded onto the web

701
00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:29,449
figure me out there

702
00:44:29,449 --> 00:44:32,880
and uh... i think it's you know it's
very important and we tried is we do all

703
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,869
our own

704
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:35,899
production and we've

705
00:44:35,899 --> 00:44:38,288
just grow into during distribution

706
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:41,639
so it is sort of seizing the means of
production distribution which is what

707
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:44,409
all these companies and economic
theories are based on this i was saying

708
00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:46,849
earlier

709
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:49,599
the thing that's going on right now is
that everyone

710
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,249
these major corporations is changing
other media into zeros and ones because

711
00:44:53,249 --> 00:44:54,309
they don't like

712
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:58,569
manufacturing their film prints or their
vinyl records they wanted off the

713
00:44:58,569 --> 00:45:01,659
informations that can be sent over your
phone line or through your cable minor

714
00:45:01,659 --> 00:45:03,059
whatever

715
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:08,159
and information needs its encryption so
there we can forget that they know that

716
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:10,429
that doesn't really work so well

717
00:45:10,429 --> 00:45:13,760
so they buy the pipes we had a a well by
time warner

718
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,509
for the cable lines

719
00:45:15,509 --> 00:45:16,459
we have

720
00:45:16,459 --> 00:45:20,499
farewell and news corporation fighting
each other for the satellites in fact we

721
00:45:20,499 --> 00:45:22,959
were murdoch was trying to buy g_m_
motors

722
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:27,598
not for g_m_ motors but because of the
latest use satellites very interesting

723
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,029
and phone companies i'm sure you have to
tell me a lot more about that and i are

724
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:32,349
they now

725
00:45:32,349 --> 00:45:34,399
and this is all about who owns

726
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,659
our pipes for distribution

727
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:39,530
now do you know our production anymore
because he can make whatever you want

728
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,729
and it took a long time for this yet

729
00:45:41,729 --> 00:45:48,469
to a lot of people

730
00:45:48,469 --> 00:45:53,369
the idea that these corporations are
american corporations is also

731
00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:56,519
not entirely accurate they made and
founded by americans

732
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:00,749
they may have uh... in base in america
for a long time but the american

733
00:46:00,749 --> 00:46:03,579
government has or control over them

734
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:05,769
very little civic virtue

735
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:08,979
and if you wanna call it that they don't
really have a nationality or a national

736
00:46:08,979 --> 00:46:10,309
morality

737
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,409
uh... so

738
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:15,289
the americanization of the world is

739
00:46:15,289 --> 00:46:18,019
sort of placing the blame the wrong
place in it

740
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:22,689
just makes everything more divided

741
00:46:22,689 --> 00:46:26,178
one of the concerns is as all these
corporation start owning everything

742
00:46:26,179 --> 00:46:31,959
let's say a lot of people in this room
probably are not in a while

743
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:34,939
what is it sixty percent on on on what
the numbers but

744
00:46:34,939 --> 00:46:36,379
they will have a lot of people

745
00:46:36,379 --> 00:46:38,919
so what happens when you have your
website up

746
00:46:38,919 --> 00:46:42,609
annandale else browser doesn't go there
anymore

747
00:46:42,609 --> 00:46:46,348
you know and it's not that strains of
thing to think about you know soon is

748
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:50,329
steve case says that there's kiddie porn
on unknown skincare

749
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:53,889
and if you don't believe that then why
were there thirty thousand riders

750
00:46:53,889 --> 00:46:56,130
two hundred thirty thousand teenagers
and

751
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:59,349
adults and old people have everybody in
seattle

752
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:02,909
that didn't get on the t_v_ because they
were writing teenagers and

753
00:47:02,909 --> 00:47:05,289
they were just trying to stop the

754
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:08,429
three businessmen of the world and
business women of the world from

755
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:10,130
doing what they have to do for the
better

756
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,029
all of us

757
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:16,619
uh... but mostly i would like to hear
what neither in the audience has to say

758
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:19,369
if anyone has anything to say there's
the huge amount of stuff that we can

759
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:20,449
talk about

760
00:47:20,449 --> 00:47:22,409
so

761
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:24,469
direction of a dictated a little bit

762
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,799
so let's open up a panel

763
00:47:26,799 --> 00:47:28,780
as i was saying earlier we're gonna do
it

764
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,769
emedia i why am thick that we do
everything if anyone

765
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:35,390
want to take part directly in the
discussion 'cause sometimes i think i

766
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,348
ask a question of the panel

767
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:38,259
and uh...

768
00:47:38,259 --> 00:47:39,899
the other sort of an answer

769
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,000
but then they move on

770
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,599
but that it was a really answer that the
discussion

771
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:47,879
is missing an element to it you know the
guy was on your earlier had a very

772
00:47:47,879 --> 00:47:52,578
different than i do so if he's in the
room who wants to come up that we call

773
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:55,979
you can also possess questions in which
move in that direction if anyone has any

774
00:47:55,979 --> 00:48:01,149
spartan keep talking

775
00:48:01,149 --> 00:48:05,469
when we come up here is like a

776
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:09,509
she's waters responsible for your
partners on the road

777
00:48:09,509 --> 00:48:10,770
possibly uh...

778
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:13,159
first of all paper tiger dot org

779
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:14,999
he has all this stuff

780
00:48:14,999 --> 00:48:20,589
and three generation tv dot com and
indymedia dot org habit another's flyers

781
00:48:20,589 --> 00:48:23,489
out before that had those resources on
them

782
00:48:23,489 --> 00:48:27,680
if not you can past me after it's all
right kathleen in the with a lot of

783
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,178
media dot org

784
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:31,109
uh... also

785
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:34,129
i don't know what the intellectual
property statute is done

786
00:48:34,129 --> 00:48:41,129
and i know made on the cake toppers

787
00:48:45,329 --> 00:48:47,409
where the plans

788
00:48:47,409 --> 00:48:51,200
uh... they're voting usher convention is
what is in the week-and-a-half

789
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,559
the end of july

790
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:53,729
there are

791
00:48:53,729 --> 00:48:58,489
uh... millions of different plans
basically the one thing that

792
00:48:58,489 --> 00:49:01,799
has gotten the movements this far is
that it is

793
00:49:01,799 --> 00:49:03,079
only solidarity

794
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:04,649
uh... not really

795
00:49:04,649 --> 00:49:07,138
one concerted effort so

796
00:49:07,139 --> 00:49:08,459
every little group

797
00:49:08,459 --> 00:49:10,649
is able to do with they're gonna do

798
00:49:10,649 --> 00:49:13,729
on their own and have mutual respect for
one another

799
00:49:13,729 --> 00:49:17,609
without really getting each other's way
are making it so that they can

800
00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:21,499
detractors one organism so um... i
couldn't really say what all the plans

801
00:49:21,499 --> 00:49:22,069
are

802
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:24,308
there's a massive convergence going on

803
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:27,429
uh... when we went down to d_c_ we were
just our own little affinity group we

804
00:49:27,429 --> 00:49:28,310
went there

805
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:31,799
we had some friends who were part of the
larger affinity groups there

806
00:49:31,799 --> 00:49:34,069
their education we were taught

807
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:37,058
you have to wear those handkerchiefs
with vinegar on them because the tear

808
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:39,439
gas it's not so you look cool

809
00:49:39,439 --> 00:49:41,219
uh... and we were taught

810
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:42,769
what's legal what's not legal

811
00:49:42,769 --> 00:49:46,380
although if you're on the street here
that's legal on the sidewalk but if you

812
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,130
go over there that's not legal

813
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:50,019
so you can make a decision but

814
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:53,569
didn't really matter because the police
as they said their when if ever we got

815
00:49:53,569 --> 00:49:54,269
it

816
00:49:54,269 --> 00:49:57,739
would happen is they would like a this
street as soon as your industry

817
00:49:57,739 --> 00:50:00,509
they would get on the other end and then
they would move up the sidewalks and

818
00:50:00,509 --> 00:50:05,569
push up the sidewalk so that you were
technically in st louis could arrest you

819
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:07,499
you need to credibly those people

820
00:50:07,499 --> 00:50:08,609
and saying that happen

821
00:50:08,609 --> 00:50:11,499
so you can ask me afterwards completely

822
00:50:11,499 --> 00:50:12,999
also

823
00:50:12,999 --> 00:50:15,729
the uh... the other thing i was going on
there was that it was a holiday on

824
00:50:15,729 --> 00:50:16,650
monday

825
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,349
so you can get arrested for whatever
reason

826
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,589
the police choose to rescue for that's
not really legal

827
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:24,249
because then you just go

828
00:50:24,249 --> 00:50:27,019
to court and then they throw it out and
you get out of holding

829
00:50:27,019 --> 00:50:30,529
but your rest on saturday in the courts
are closed on monday

830
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:35,149
you're in there until tuesday no matter
what you were arrested for

831
00:50:35,149 --> 00:50:38,618
that's why there was a mass arrests on
saturday

832
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:42,249
and a couldn't really do anything about
it except

833
00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:46,069
the police were accepting fifty dollars
to let you out there some statute about

834
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:48,919
that so they made a lot of money

835
00:50:48,919 --> 00:50:51,589
but i don't know if anyone has any
questions on how to get information and

836
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:53,290
i know that there is a website

837
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:57,149
because i don't know the website

838
00:50:57,149 --> 00:51:03,779
uh... there's indymedia dot org has a
lot of information audiovideo print

839
00:51:03,779 --> 00:51:05,460
and uh... photographs

840
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:10,190
and they'll be updating all the time as
the um... in events go on in

841
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:12,729
philadelphia it's odd july

842
00:51:12,729 --> 00:51:17,959
twenty ninth of august fourth and
there'll be supposedly now babe clamp

843
00:51:17,959 --> 00:51:22,839
down to only allow protests the week on
the weekend and after that the city will

844
00:51:22,839 --> 00:51:28,288
be shut down for any protest thing
except outside the um... but barriers

845
00:51:28,289 --> 00:51:32,319
that they uh... decided upon but uh...
that won't

846
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,769
stand there are people building now

847
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:39,139
she acts for the homeless that are
coming from at kensington welfare rights

848
00:51:39,139 --> 00:51:42,130
union is coming from all over the
country

849
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:43,259
never building not

850
00:51:43,259 --> 00:51:45,389
houses and stuff for them

851
00:51:45,389 --> 00:51:48,019
and there will be uh...

852
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:50,289
the million billionaires march

853
00:51:50,289 --> 00:51:55,749
and a couple other uh... events planned
as uh... a lot of the at active is these

854
00:51:55,749 --> 00:51:57,729
days have a little more humor

855
00:51:57,729 --> 00:51:59,129
then in the past

856
00:51:59,129 --> 00:52:03,949
los angeles three a convention center
has been uh... they're building a

857
00:52:03,949 --> 00:52:09,189
seventeen foot fence around perimeter a
certain ten-block area i believe

858
00:52:09,189 --> 00:52:11,019
seventeen feet

859
00:52:11,019 --> 00:52:17,140
they won't allow anybody near it in
order to keep the event running properly

860
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:22,308
and uh... this is again another slap in
the face to our first amendment rights

861
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:27,269
which are totally destroyed but this
past that as you can see over the more

862
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:32,259
the people stand up to more oppression
that there's going to be and um... so he

863
00:52:32,259 --> 00:52:35,900
just checking the media theirs but
direct action network

864
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,180
fewer comwebsite for that uh... search
engine

865
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:42,349
fareham having a lot of events but as
uh...

866
00:52:42,349 --> 00:52:48,179
this man said there are about millions
of coalition uh... building groups and

867
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:52,030
that's another confusing thing to the
police and the government is that

868
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:56,809
that use the consensus that used to
hundreds of people making decisions in

869
00:52:56,809 --> 00:53:02,129
little groups and making what works you
know they like pop down management

870
00:53:02,129 --> 00:53:03,729
so um... that's

871
00:53:03,729 --> 00:53:05,699
well i know

872
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:07,950
let's come up there all sit down if you
can sit down

873
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:10,539

874
00:53:10,539 --> 00:53:13,889
all right if they don't want to come up

00:53:51,759 --> 00:53:58,759

943
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:48,989
deal with the media and accurately
represent what happens

944
00:57:48,989 --> 00:57:53,189
in the past has been commercial centers
where you can go and be educated that

945
00:57:53,189 --> 00:57:54,598
split

946
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:59,009
i know its most of the weekend before
uh... there's gonna be a massive public

947
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:03,339
rally on the sunday right before
everything starts

948
00:58:03,339 --> 00:58:06,808

party's over dot org is it all those

949
00:58:06,809 --> 00:58:10,409

no plastic

951
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:15,779
and uh... yeah they're still need
massive stuff going on but you work

952
00:58:15,779 --> 00:58:19,239
primarily within your affinity group
correct and then you can go and you can

953
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:22,619
get education they basically the most
part they have media representatives

954
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:26,739
there so if you are interviewed because
of the way the uh... because they're

955
00:58:26,739 --> 00:58:31,539
manipulated it's best to something over
