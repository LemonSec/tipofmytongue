3
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,199

until there's no sir

6

ok there's some but not close enough to
the Mikes would bring the mic and

7

bandwith access to the Internet

12
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,610
is party ladies ball because

13
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,630
she has problems reading screen work

14
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,570

20
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,970
the talk is loaded with access to the
Internet

21
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,710
using public library terminals others
because

22
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,260
many public libraries in the modern era
a lot of people just

23
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,860
walking on the street walk up to the
internet terminals and start using them

24
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,119
I have a hotmail account like Hotmail
account other

25
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,220
places during be back

26
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,709

00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:17,849
with a below bring

28

bided

29
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:26,440
up okay that helps Muslim

30
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,480
friend on the trick is that a lot of

31
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,170
quote webmasters close quote thinking
need

32
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,670
graphics for everything that they can't
say anything without

33
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,160
graphics to meet the most heinous

34
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,950
crime on the Internet is putting up a
website

35
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,030
that has words printed on the graphics

36
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,830
and then there is no alt tag saying

37
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,980
what those words are so for we who come
in

38
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,160
with the nine graphic web browsers such
as links we see in big bold letters

39
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,710
NY me oh and brain

40
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,200
I'll these are things that

41
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,500
while Lynx's get pretty good frames
these days

42
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,720
it can differentiate and drop you
through to the various friends you have

43
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,000
on a page it still can handle in like it
will tell you the name of the graphic

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,370
now

45
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,740
others can sometimes be a clue but says

46
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,170
red Baldock Jeff that maybe it's just a
little ball is put at the beginning of a

47
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,070
long line

48
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,690
to set it off well why couldn't they put
alt equals

49
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,400
quote asterisk quo so that

50
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,510
way it shows a little red ball by:

51
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,109
when I'm graphic user who Joe asterisk
which looks like

52
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,970
a little all I never that oh yeah

53
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,250

54
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,550

57
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,020

58
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,830

while driving ilie

61
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:21,659
undergone using talking interfaces to do
it

62
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,770
that's when it starts going to improve
unfortunately up

63
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,289

125
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,289
to rob watson glitz a lot to graphics

126

that that doesn't do with it there's an
alt tag

127
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,539
alt equals quote quote and that means
that for the night graphic user

128
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,300
accuracy anything but it will be given
the air message up

route the call are its it's about

208
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:40,310
the programmer not knowing everything

209
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:45,089
are if you're sitting there in web
design studio

it look like to you

215
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,949

216
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:08,400

217
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,709
the image tag a specially those images
are in cables

218
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:16,490
a table cannot display until it knows
the width and height

219
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,470
up every graphic it's going to display
within the table

220
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,579
what's got the information you can put
the information up with the table up and

221
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,560
fill in the graphic later

222
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,500
at least your user I seventy keeping
busy

223
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,600
and long I'll this isn't loading it can
possibly be loading

224
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,720
I'm gonna go somewhere else by me

225
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,110
I love the image tag is source equals
with the URL of the image

226
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,579
well just bring that image up in York

00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:57,610
the netscape rain it will gear

231
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,439
the whip followed by the height so you
don't say strict sequels

232
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:06,349
mumble mumble dot Jeff close quote with
nicole's quote

233
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,910

234
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,890
close quote alt equals quote quo

235
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:17,380
if nothing else or say all that was
quote

236
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,290
photo of a large group in front of
spacecraft close quote

237
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,719
a thats on one of my pages where Mike
class from before two spaces

238
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,030
to was all posed to be I P Columbia
Space Shuttle in the decal some building

239
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,500
arm I think that shot maybe in the book

240
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,380
book are we'll get to that I love

241
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,230
basically let the page you know how big
things are

242
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,410
took in display the page quickly okay

243
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,969
so the graphics loading later especially
on a slow line

244
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,650
your user at least have something to
read and keeping busy and

245
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:59,919
I'm your page until those graphics
commit

246
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,720
yet there really are you know i i

247
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,809
idea at the same time a muted by the
graphics I often pity might

248
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:12,100
cited hallmarks because day

249
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,510
you know click on this honesty really
great and and then everybody go to lunch

250
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,630
waiting for the graphics too low made
entries using links

251
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,020
saw the text comes in a snap
anti-government contact

252
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,760
so there are days when tax only mode is
a real winner

253
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,610
especially on a heavily graphics like
bridges 10 a few pieces of information

254
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,449
really helps are the way tables work
though is that usually have a

255
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:43,370
our column down the left side have to
jump past all that first column stop

256
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,169
where table well is laid out forget to
be

257
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:51,770
central column which is where the fish
and for that particular pages

258
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,179
the below that is the column for the
right hand side of the page and

259
00:16:55,179 --> 00:17:01,650
ducts got three bucks for the stuff you
wanted slip up the next page

260
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,668

00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:59,559
they're working on it but not yet Sala

315
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:04,678
my my access to that as a limited yes

316
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:11,679
question

317
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,899
Bush was so be good to go love work with
the UML Wales markup language

318
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:30,010
and it was a lot going on well I don't
worry about your ground on their

319
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,340
our with anything in Java but

320
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:39,269
are basically are if it's the first text
based and those blue

321
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:42,929
bones don't have room for graphics work
has to be text buddies

322
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:46,720
so together has been better than nothing
but

323
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,649
arm when information content is all you
know what more can we get just got a

324
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:50,950
little

325
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,630
bomb are it'll help because again it'll

326
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,779
make the webmaster little more aware to
me the web critters

327
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:02,950
a little more aware the network Mestalla
prove themselves on

328
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,970
I took that concept from %uh jim warren
doctored up Journal

329
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,070
who look after congress critters years
ago

330
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,029
Kors he was sure they were all men and

331
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:18,580
but they're definitely critters so there
are these web critters out there

332
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,620
creating web pages

333
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,960
arm your WML said

334
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,090
has been mostly text based since the way
it was receivers

335
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:33,090
don't have much my graphics that has the
hell

336
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:40,320
mmm supports firms and feels that's good

337
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,380
cool so you to get links to send owners
that its

338
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,360
a where was the vice and it'll get
taxpayers to

339
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,750
but that could be 0 away reading
something simple

340
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,390
to put some on a PC maybe get through a
speech synthesizer in such

341
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:05,390
have to look at that bank yes

342
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,980
ok very simple are just bring up
pictures of that sort of thing

343
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,110
up at the top click on View go down a
bit

344
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:21,509
clicks sores and look at the code there
now uses going off to

345
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:25,460
some kind of the ASB your CGI arm

346
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,309
there are libraries such CGI's and you
can download those

347
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:37,309
and look at the source code bows you
still have to pay a fee in CGI

348
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,490
meeting at you see the ongoing code is
that weakens now

349
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,580
you see the text for this trade sending
out well as

350
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,639
yeah not always though it won't be
scrolling but some Middle East sure

351
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,900
what's in that text is

352
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,050
an also what's happened in line is a lot
of times it'll say

353
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,570
man I don't am

354
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,179
I don't know what this is it'll it'll
such spewing numbers

355
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:15,460
and and then it'll go you know thirty
seconds forty seconds 50 seconds and

356
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,290
drive increased

357
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,990
saw you know sometimes

358
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,920
when they try to refresh the screen into

359
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,690
really and coming it was willing to
really

360
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:34,690
really missing yes

361
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,060
her

362
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:15,190
know a graphic there

363
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:19,400
but what's a graphic a graphic is a bit
patter

364
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,680
to be displayed for viewing there is no
information content within that to say

365
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,250
what that graphic is

366
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,860
there's no clue other than maybe the bio
manager joaquin

367
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,360
yeah

368
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,650
there is no way to tell what that are
text on the graphic is because it is

369
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,330
merely

370
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,449
and image and it would after I mean

371
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,750
there are so many different graphics out
there that even if it had you know like

372
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,690
and

373
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:49,830
box which is why together in a graphic
in the first place oh well that's not a

374
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,510
significant issues health Erica

375
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:58,510
year yes

376
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,039
well standards is something else again

377
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,379
well yeah I not regulation but

378
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,700
standards and I mean

379
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,970
there are there are certain lobbying
group of I know

380
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:29,110
it people know about the AOL lawsuit nom

381
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:33,600
whether blind consumer group is suing
AOL because

382
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,659
it doesn't have any underlying text so
there's no way that

383
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:42,320
blind parents can come in and monitor
what their kids are looking at am

384
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,950
accompany the American with Disabilities
Act but

385
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,669
it doesn't matter it's just its

386
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:54,799
pretty insignificant Anna there has to
be more behind it than just us because

387
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,280
a or not people

388
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,700
people are willing to forgot our market
an

389
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,650
because obviously regarding people can
say so an

390
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:10,470
there they don't care and of course

391
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,390
come just like the standard governments
in his agency just been redrawn

392
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:18,909
gotta love sayings that he made so many
of them there is something called Bobby

393
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:25,559
and bobby is a on of that okay

394
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,940
around up a thing you can run your

395
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,210
web code through to see you accessible
on

396
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:36,270
then unfortunately it's not

397
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,309
palm

398
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:42,559
it's a buried somewhere on some site at
the moment but

399
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,000
an if obviously if you

400
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,460
route for in find it and it really

401
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,770
is very strict and I'll go through in

402
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,860
tell you all that stuff your site is and
isn't doing its a

403
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,250
based on a British policeman

404
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,590
so that's why that's what about me again
for us Robert Peel

405
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,000
form much of them please back the
nineteenth century

406
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
other companies yes clinician mobility
your

407
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:18,770
but is looking for I'll total
accessibility as well

408
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:24,500
leaning that way your at doesn't spit
out and what doesn't kill you if you

409
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,289
have graphics but it does tell you if
you have no other alternative

410
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:30,679
so I don't have one

411
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:35,809
up to that page yet arm did you go with
your home intro something up

412
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:39,200
that'll be a spacey ideas dot com slash

Cheshire's CHD message hi Rd

416
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,630
at my homepage and

417
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:57,320
there you'll be fine to lick to the
brand new AT&T racing fan club

418
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,240
well they won't let you joining the tell
the players America

419
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,250
so we'll have to spank love polly
exploits other number twenty Pontiac

on Busch Grand National Series battered
by AT&T

421
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,049
as i said im AT&T and fan club do not go
in the same sentence

422
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:17,929
marlon concerns a so

423
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:24,929
yes but

424
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,670
website is absurd mission are in the
book as PDF files

425
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,950
your comments on that Anna

426
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,500
Abdullah try and remember what it looks
like on

427
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,690
you have Adobe Reader mission now

428
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:48,640
up well then I this yeah the young I
know that om

429
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,680
that when I A concept %ah detest

430
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,300
first came out that was when it first
came out

431
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:03,060
that was people who have the book in
print packing in every single word

432
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,429
to text files yeah

433
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,230
that was that was what that meant home
friskin

434
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:14,020
on and now all these

435
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,820
now that some excited people got the
idea on putting

436
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,100
and aching Kim download meet want to
wait in line movies

437
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,940
to get now most special formats

438
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,020
and it's defeated the whole purpose for
us mom

439
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,850
you know you don't have a thing you know
you read it I'm actually

440
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:36,520
this is embarrassing to say but I'm
actually using dos

441
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,370
member dos as I get home I

442
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:43,790
feeling for helping and I said that this

443
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:48,399
what stop you know

444
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,760
when you click on to get to us yeah

445
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,020
you move your mouse and why mom play

446
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,200
communications program you see in and
the whole s

447
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,730
the whole idea Remo even missus for you
know remote host

448
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:06,550
child count but yet

449
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:10,090
that's what happens PDF files just its
it's just unit just

450
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:14,870
just have a thing mom seems like a lot
of stuff is

451
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,020
specifically to like Microsoft Word

452
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:23,129
or something attack windows every other

453
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,390
every couple weeks and I'm gonna learns
million and up in

454
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,180
a loop that that this before

455
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,770
you guessing windows back sighted people
the first thing to go

456
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:40,180
when I miss something up his speech
first thing to go it's not that great in

457
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,000
the first place

458
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,820
that person like that person ever at so
I can do with that point is

459
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,510
it he is and lot adhesion

460
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,810
even resort to using the mouse even
though I have no idea

461
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,290
what with is happening

462
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:01,560
I just click on skype sometimes it works
sometimes a sidetrack

463
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:08,560
yes

464
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,690
yes it's just a attacks on the site %uh
but for the most part be certain that

465
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,010
any graphics which contain useful
information

466
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,020
are described in all text also

467
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:31,170
yet like Amazon

468
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,910
stuff like that no roundabout no

469
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,640
the 257 item on the menu

470
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,360
buried at the bottom says text only sell
yet you can

471
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,150
you can always have that option then
people who want

472
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,309
concert for text keep in mind too

473
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:53,800
Martin I know but I hate

474
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,860
yeah the up but at the very bottom when
your last wakes

475
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,240
up bot size equals -5

476
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,550
because on wax everything is the same
size anyway doesn't look but geographic

477
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,940
people probably won't notice that

478
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,870
we can hit the number on want to go to
the bottom of the page

479
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:14,740
and then its Howard our last like this
that becomes highlighted

480
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,080
that becomes the text don't like boom
we're off to text only

481
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:25,080
what a concept

482
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,279
it doesn't matter

483
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,549
it really doesn't matter some people
like it I mean

484
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:41,570
that that doesn't matter at all however
you want to design it

485
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:47,029
is is how you design it and now I always
say

486
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:51,570
mom and this is just a preference is
nothing to do with vision

487
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:55,689
that if you doing anything like an
informational thing

488
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,789
I don't know something you want people
to read always have the option

489
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:03,690
downloading you know downing it which
you always do

490
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:07,059
you you know the feeling links but yeah
but

491
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:10,219
and but as far as part how you earn it
that's

492
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,690
estonia you

493
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:20,690
yes

494
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:36,290

495
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:43,290
school tips right yes

496
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:50,960
for good or bad went

497
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,480
mandela well I'll give you my worst
example was

498
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,750
coca-cola .co.uk you know you've got

499
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,060
go like it US a good example go to

500
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,779
seeing eye to eye toward its

501
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,070
the doc school for some reason day a

502
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:15,750
like there's intact but they have some
graphics on it

503
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:20,400
you know because the family's coming to
look at that site and dogs so

504
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,490
they have a site which is totally
accessible you

505
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:28,450
example yet we're having now I'm trying
to get a site up and running now

506
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,819
for for another guide on Users group and
we're gonna

507
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,580
lot pictures but we're gonna put them
somewhere

508
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:40,160
where you have to triple when you first
walk in you know if it's an option

509
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,230
the death that's what it's all about his
options yet

510
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,910
corporation want graphic intensive that
you know you give up of what they want

511
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:47,940
you know

512
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,260
customer is always right and all that
stuff but you know

513
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,760
bury it somewhere in case secretary

514
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:02,710
happens to a text other questions

515
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:09,710
yes

516
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:23,600
people are krueger a different
downloading schemes yes

517
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,790
well yeah i doing that without sight I
mean

518
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:38,790
you know I feel really stupid when it's
obvious I can't figure

519
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,200
yeah yeah this is just bad design

520
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,800
you know some people have a bug up their
asses you gonna jump through their hoops

521
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,280
have

522
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,860
if you wanna get their stuff and

523
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,510
it's not user friendly and when you have
users

524
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,090
who have difficulties in the first place
and King

525
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:11,090
it doesn't help at all yeah

526
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:24,630
what does it do

527
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:31,339
planning directors

528
00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:36,578
go far as being the source page yeah

529
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:40,670
yeah you know if you have time to go to
the source

530
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:47,670
yeah

531
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,300
min

532
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,790
there in a while that would be dating
back to the

533
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:06,420
the PDF pushing I realize you didn't
really cover your question

534
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,290
are it is possible to bring in a PDF
file

535
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:15,119
sometimes you can highlight the text cop
you have to put into

536
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,740
like a note pad by or something I would
be possible to deal with the text

537
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,390
portion

538
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:23,549
remember why a company using a PDF file
the first place

539
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:27,210
is they don't want people to just
mess-up the way they want their content

540
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,030
display

541
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:31,360
that's why he's a very expensive program

542
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,290
to prepare a file in a format that
anyone can read with the free reader

543
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:40,279
are thats really cut it behind you in
PDF portable document files

544
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,150
yeah anybody who's using Windows and was
using Windows yes this is Jer

545
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,800
for Mac but if you're not going out to a
community that

546
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,010
really can't handle Windows or or max

547
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:57,190
well we can handle it just liked right
there there are soccer practice there in

548
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:02,200
like you know Windows inherently is is
on you know picture on cable

549
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,760
point in crime that's you know what it's
all about i'm concerned. cell

550
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,440
it's a very visual medium and no matter
what you do to it you can

551
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,609
have finest designers in the world but
matter what you do today

552
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:16,460
it's always gonna be don't maybe
people's otherwise comments before

553
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:21,390
condition was congressman okay arm

554
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:25,020
I'm going to just briefly mention that

all the images are in images directly go
affluent through those look at them
