worry that true

164
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,780
okay but yeah I think I think I'll start
to think about now for the next 10 a.m.

165
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,230
est

166
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,430
but know that much important questions
are

167
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,730
thank you tell you that I'm yeah

168
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,620
realizes up okay I

169
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,820
questioning I here

170
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,170
ports yes his own I

171
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,349
online Radio Shack by here

172
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,040
you know it yeah pitching years yeah

173
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,439
you enable with because all only

174
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,240
going sure because they public but
cheaper technology

175
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,330
remember that when ATT developed

176
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,890
the town system and what have you was
back in the days I V gold-plated network

177
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,170
when they could not only justify
spending money

178
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,560
I'm whenever they can well they could
spend money and whatever they could

179
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,420
justify

180
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,650
they were that force by the FCC tariffs

181
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,150
to make back that money plus a rate of
return

182
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,920
okay in the air up competition you can
spend that kind of money

183
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,010
you get a bottom line to worry about
