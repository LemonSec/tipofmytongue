1
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,260
really extremely agitated guys %uh

2
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,400
met the that then

3
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,260
on average get 300 brand new viruses
never before seen in awhile

4
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,440
each month now thinking of

5
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,610
300

6
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,269
every person Myers's each month as a lot

7
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,590
ed as he says this sparsely attended a

8
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,610
right now that numbers into by her six
hundred

9
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:07,190
per month her

10
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:13,000
you know it's the Internet I got a story
%uh

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,420
I was a lot of trouble first exact sixty
as taking back a lot of people

12
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,720
and at dinner a room met be in

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,090
we are talking about they're like yeses
I'm a little less than a

14
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,850
it's known John down the the cure for

15
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,410
read the complete as what the Alameda

16
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:37,039
and we're all talking about hot brunette
he was highlight this is

17
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,590
ally classifiers so how long it take
John Wright debt signs

18
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,580
I get the all the layers staring at me
and Wayne

19
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,150
chill was like my the only thinking
about that

20
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,979
honestly and his really good about not
having anybody in there

21
00:01:54,979 --> 00:02:00,310
ever ever written computer virus I
actually know some cases where are they

22
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,670
here

23
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,680
you believe desperately want to hire and
when the questions they ask on the asked

24
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,450
in the interview

25
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,720
not really like so like every fires

26
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,769
legacy I wrote one or two when I was a
kid like can I am

27
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:17,049
and yet here's a security escort you out

28
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:20,650
on I would say

29
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,750
I can't think of a single anti-virus
software company that actually went

30
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,459
flying

31
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:28,049
ever rectifiers there very very strict
about that

32
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:31,170
on even if you download the

33
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,519
legendary buyers right programs

34
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:37,920
thousands if not there right now even
play line

35
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,810
just are actually creating lenses for
experiments forget about ever working

36
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,840
and I was happening carrier I

37
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,140
well we can do is on his way to a close
you're going to my actual

38
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:56,140
presentation here well as a

39
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,130
18 accidentally using powerpoints really
simple

40
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,340
okay this is their next devices

41
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,490
that's me just a hollow

42
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:40,490
like this the first time in Tyler uses
so basically

43
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,480
when we go through this presentation
here he should be able to actually

44
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,510
understand

45
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,920
look its best

46
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,930
is in the house remarks were

47
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,380
that's what we can do you're going to
get introduction Italian what

48
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,430
you don't give you look at work station
W John

49
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,270
there first of its own actually defines
me

50
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:09,270
what purifiers this melissa's

51
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,870
software replicating the so he said
that's a very good

52
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,980
I would accept that to keep workers

53
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,530
replicating I'll K

54
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,680
malicious software that replicates

55
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,820
for a virus the virus that has spread

56
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,140
now when I say there's center

57
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,159
you know up to 600 reimburses a

58
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,560
release lol per month just never see
he's

59
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,620
there's a reason Muslims suck they're
not written very well

60
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:48,290
in our %uh I do know that he says were
you had a heavy duty virus writers

61
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,040
well as the old school virus writers now
he's fifty

62
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,850
with basic knowledge can actually write
fires Alan the mast mast

63
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,880
damage and we'll get into that a little
later

64
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,560
as that's nice already related to start
now in the old school

65
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,350
the guys arraigned other viruses were
brilliant

66
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,090
these were good herders mean is that new
the programming languages inside and out

67
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,600
alunet your machine inside the house

68
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,800
the exact with the calls to make the new
exactly how to make the cuts all

69
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,060
on who cares if their church right media
buyers there early in Jersey now

70
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,120
the problem now this is anyway

71
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,520
my anyway you don't see much the same as
like to send us the outside

72
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,870
and him just happens %uh back to those
on the Allstar diana's

73
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,500
who uses actions said the viruses into

74
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,630
like McAfee and Norton said anyway I
sitting in figure this one out

75
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,669
they would actually have 24 hour
sessions with a taxi

76
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:56,390
reverse engineer the virus code and
actually had

77
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:02,250
dad quality for the next stage is still
animal and leave it yet but actually

78
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,760
pero not high next few days

79
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,180
that's never cry yeah well into the
matter

80
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,039
right thing marvelous heavy duty like
the island new buyers

81
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,729
like that which was that in my opinion

82
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:19,760
although it was fires it really was

83
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,969
buyers you know as a visual

84
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,419
the script written by no place for it

85
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:33,140
you know I detest computer viruses

86
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,260
overtaxed purifiers is are updated

87
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,700
false alarms forget muscle is in trouble
all

88
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,740
utmost us lots person and total

89
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,640
and these are the conclusions can be
talking about how are they displaced

90
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,380
speakers

91
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,280
I time computer viruses that are out
there

92
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,610
%uh boot sector virus is there's file
letters

93
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,930
multi-part I am viruses macros

94
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:04,400
and you know they did but EDS that's
there yet as

95
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,400
as a wholly different subject my opinion
I

96
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:17,789
effects files and but

97
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:21,830
there's a new buyers here expires yes is
the answer

98
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,109
yeah

99
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,219
well just for information there's about

100
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:31,219
30 or 40 fires is out there

101
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:34,399
by us and anti CMOS

102
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,509
is a very very old sector buyers excited
about us

103
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:41,429
so this is not new to address their

104
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:44,589
anyway York now K

105
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,169
I'm I love is expressed discuss how they
were

106
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,128
and the different types I have a look
freezing

107
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:57,379
as liberals are okay those are the
buyer's

108
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:00,459
attacks NDRI hard drive and of yes

109
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:05,479
is imminent remember using populous
in-hand

110
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:08,860
missed the green at as I had

111
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:15,050
I yeah method is that nobody had
elevators the money

112
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,649
all the links and is like a hand needed
to

113
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:22,319
follow towards he's 84 deadlines so our

114
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,009
haha pains to at my job

115
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:29,479
your body misfired I'm

116
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,120
around yeah I whole

117
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,139
Alice no a whole 10 days myself as
fertile

118
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:41,110
I X O that's fine

119
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,870
good could have been here NPR's actually
divided into three different parts

120
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,870
yet heard her and partisan information
higher

121
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,910
Mr by IA say what action

122
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,500
when they went up by Friday one person
to persons

123
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,120
and I am was by IKEA

124
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,329
each

125
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:06,620
it that way gratifying yes the last last
this sector

126
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,600
I up with the virus

127
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,649
our visitors actually tax the MBR are

128
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:18,860
copies the code on the drive to a
different sector

129
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,430
on the right help a hard sell

130
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,430
on the on the boot sector has multiple
sectors

131
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,550
two years up for Twitter programs
mikhail history lotsa

132
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,069
the centers are never used by anything
ever

133
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:37,920
buyers lenders need this %uh

134
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,120
Rohan sector 79 well

135
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,130
1722 is a sec there's a lot of viruses
actions at their home

136
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:50,269
copy the column the actual Bhutto the
hotel you like syntax error

137
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:54,420
I am happy you know when from for the
task easier you know

138
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,309
we're not deserting us floating in the
air message that's where the error

139
00:09:58,309 --> 00:09:59,579
message came from Zack

140
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:03,189
hold so that whole exiting written it
also gives the address

141
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:06,670
how to interpret yeah %uh the

142
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,870
belt even so for that's how it is route

143
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,870
copies with different sector completely

144
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:19,639
encompasses I'll over the cold enter
code explicit different sectors

145
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,089
so they actually copies to multiple
sectors I like

146
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:27,350
is a lot of 27 1912 lol unit closes

147
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,500
checks and 7 not just the

148
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,250
the right coder 9 that other for the 12
months old

149
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:41,250
and classifies credit Kodak Cipolla just
had a little

150
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:46,589
.0 product design here %uh it is
actually

151
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:50,089
very very possible to mostly molding

152
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:53,480
thats a hard drive was comfortable
center Meyers

153
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,480
I love experimenting with her

154
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,720
were slightly injured in New York litany
Esen

155
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,690
and

156
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,690
anti CMOS and its kinda cool because

157
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,910
what most people do with the you not
think the viruses or other ski NDS

158
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,750
no but that this is the drive to develop
just now stands drive

159
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,840
once alright than ever the fires but it
doesn't like

160
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,920
find the viruses past that so

161
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,560
good see details at the actual the
Buddha and stay in your system

162
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,950
get rid of virus live again

163
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,870
and stand again verifying that desires
there

164
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,260
now the second thing is i'd

165
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,600
on there's like personal the Boozer is
that partition table

166
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,020
other all the in the army to in the
hardest deformation address instructor

167
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,100
yes now some viruses are

168
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,110
you're a bitch is and Alexi

169
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,360
crips that partition in effort to
restructure

170
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,940
on the hard drive K and

171
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,760
requiring the buyers act in love
actually loved

172
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,410
2d crib your tree structure so if you
remove it

173
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,520
incorrectly everything is done

174
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,790
it's all headed classes purifiers

175
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:15,130
the whole world is the monkey bars %uh
West actually does this exact same thing

176
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,780
om the month was ruling a brilliant
fires

177
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,270
a just real me denny has

178
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,400
on me the boot sector virus is tasked
your return home

179
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,850
are required girls the bottom and at yes

180
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,030
slashed NPR alright

181
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,780
thank you will actually use at this
slash NPR all

182
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,990
and I love you guys get law I don't just
talk one

183
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,310
on com would agree not there in her then

184
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,680
Sharan along where now

185
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,339
well for those of you who have been
designed capital his call

186
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:53,130
%uh activists last in Dr you people

187
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,000
waiting on just now as a little bit but
it does s

188
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,420
I don't care what close their after what
it is

189
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,089
just laugh branded her for most viruses

190
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:09,550
is a I was gone and start get over
things were fine

191
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,130
Gary

192
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:19,350
s that to rush been saying it doesn't
work the GPL be buyers

193
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,360
you're right it doesn't you know why is
the monthly

194
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,589
increased the fat partition mission
actually

195
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:30,680
I'll that's not true it has worked
worked perfectly replaces the code

196
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,010
he just K getting think that have the
dryer you might as well just

197
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,980
I did s and leave it at that well

198
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,209
when the antivirus companies did for
monkey is the actual

199
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:45,760
create something called a seven-letter
now this was a really great idea

200
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,290
what it does is the senior residences

201
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,699
hey he and I had another try year

202
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,170
it is good that you see indignation
processes the virus

203
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,970
was gonna run into a quote unquote
sandbox like situation

204
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,140
so what happens is like your any other
drug myself

205
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,160
and s internet what's the code looks
pretty tricky

206
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,730
the policies that he trip he %uh

207
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,300
his thought process is the key to decode
the vet

208
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,390
partisan information and it requires

209
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,930
and like at school right

210
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:27,000
message then I he's being the boss

211
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,920
alright

212
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,750
damn I'm test

213
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,010
up a sacrifice estelle hi more in the
printing

214
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,170
or any combination use the second are in
st.

215
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,590
incorporating several one or all he says

216
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,860
as it was business combination %uh was
part of the nation's

217
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:53,340
I'm still possess a virus

218
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,090
every for me when reading one basically
we're still

219
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,200
us as high as hell and I'm in class %uh

220
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,120
this is flying just having an antivirus
are on your system

221
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,690
does this leave me that you're clean
coal because this

222
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,820
this is still high risk high cell your
antivirus software

223
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,380
so for those you guys in actually

224
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,460
have astronomers all the years in your
emails %uh

225
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,100
following tests for your friends and
healing he lashed antivirus of

226
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,880
reproductive system can you install it

227
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,939
any other team by calling play not
necessarily

228
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,640
I L because this actually happened to me

229
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,680
a I actually

230
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,980
was that surround this is the highest as
that is the israeli experiment

231
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,170
I like a and said I was this media

256
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,589
a second fires I actually got hit by

257
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:15,810
I'll when is a bigger than the old days

258
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:19,569
brothers lol India's

261
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,760
and smaller than the antifreeze and

262
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,070
I accidentally hit with a virus Rd SE a
virus

263
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,110
to know working around ideas

264
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,090
that's yeah fun him or my house a
luncheon all

265
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,399
PBS's and also they say not as I

266
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,760
this research I get this far says

267
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,330
something amazing has happened way the
hell says

268
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,699
their computers online I'm but just as
infected

269
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,920
with viruses like I shared has s

270
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,550
a boom and the Holy passes like

271
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,990
sign up it was actually I puppeteers

272
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,120
from a ya ir soccer star which had hoped
to share or

273
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,200
yes bad idea basket so what that their
mother

274
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,520
a shower and tires I was the smartest
and that there's like

275
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,110
yeah alright

276
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,370
polymorphic viruses %uh these really
cool

277
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,710
with polymorphic viruses are %uh

278
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,500
the team's the coat each time replicate
and they said

279
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,510
Kelly difficult for it RSR a

280
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,580
program to track down because when the
antivirus programs for

281
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,429
yeah houses they work on specific
signatures looking for specific things

282
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,960
so the change the code on the next heart
%uh

283
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,860
once again we're going back to this
entire thing here

284
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,110
last it is an actual tactic because they
don't change isn't it so many different

285
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,940
factors

286
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,490
I absolutely have to do is they have to
take the whole strain in actual fact

287
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,080
that it

288
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,320
down well and once again with the is
hitting the simulator

289
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,659
and he said and the Rustler readiness
and

290
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,320
they go through the whole County process
and then there was

291
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,409
file fires now apply to every person
also sell

292
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:21,090
just the same market called I

293
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,340
critic sacrifices recruiting viruses
look good yeah

294
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,699
or themselves make it more difficult to
move doesn't it

295
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,190
possible recovery day without the prior
to the PN

296
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,600
a in it that true PCI data

297
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,510
like the monkey bars was for action is
the

298
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,250
nosy when I say possible that's honestly
true

299
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,850
you can text get your data back it
justice

300
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:52,230
a major in the butt and I'm free by
saying I'm

301
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:57,140
said population has a no clue on how to
do this other fires where

302
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,940
a really look forward to this is a
leslie has really nice

303
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,050
right up there I was actually gonna
start mister

304
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,360
haha uneasily dealers and

305
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,260
please I wasn't enough research and when
I when ice-t's

306
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,730
at 80 K %uh because I had

307
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,880
this accident first trip to New York and
this place fucking

308
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,600
loss I love this place is now next a las
Vegas is a nice

309
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:30,120
might be replaced come come back for
more as a separate blasts

310
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,800
I Leslie here than any place else las
Vegas has

311
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,810
like and this place has a polls from
hell so call

312
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:41,389
ideology that is yes but I don't do as I
say there's a high as a half-mile

313
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,250
yeah

314
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,990
as a just curiosity has another

indicate that

428
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:14,689
%uh same of France's are not see our
privacy

429
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,490
allocation has the army's so Eagle PC

430
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,890
with the sale haitian sore in our
defense

431
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:27,040
the only ones yes sutherland's yes

432
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,540
some the for complicated ones No %uh

433
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:34,899
like so that problem viruses lives in a
specific calls that are only available

434
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,730
until

435
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:40,210
a specific operating system and doesn't
exist yes

436
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:44,010
%uh anyone tell me liners are a hostile

437
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,260
a Mac fires yeah

438
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,590
rectory getting all your questions to
re-program

439
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:56,020
yet and that product as for the answer

440
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:01,570
lead really hard on Akbar's

441
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:05,860
that why pay

442
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,080
L

443
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,040
I would argue that as a disguise sat
down over here so I can why I think mess

444
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,290
low yes

445
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,830
top dollar for viruses now basically and
thats

446
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,210
that shell is because it's not the most
popular PC

447
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:27,010
in the market okay everyone matheus
20pcs

448
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:30,480
so virus writers federal right the
eighty Cornell

449
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,550
was a very carefully getting on the
stock think about this

450
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:37,230
very very carefully before he said there
is a I what looks to be the operating

451
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,270
system of choice for

452
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,500
ever in the whole world which the
million legal their

453
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,430
three sliders thousands Palooza viruses
out there

454
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:50,550
always Hardesty has the most other
operating system in the world

455
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,070
so irish writers are right

456
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,870
the most popular application and the
most powerful or

457
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:01,950
operating system why because are all
other viruses they have

458
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,710
to replicate they don't replicate her
useless

459
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,870
sowell only let becomes

460
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,150
or FreeBSD because the artists like
everybody

461
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,150
desktop it was CS Lewis viruses out
there

462
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:19,890
except for her it's Eunice which is a
different story

463
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,450
as you exit and Unitarians file yes

464
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,480
yes but

465
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,210
inherently in S is not inherently

466
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,070
exceptional so maybe it

467
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:37,560
decided to go towards lessen the units
of princess

468
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,290
this much more difficult who can tell me
is like to get a red shirt he inspires

469
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,720
is /url

470
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,600
to
