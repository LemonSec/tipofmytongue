00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:15,969
faster let's just say you can't do it
which

184
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,979
any machine play data my way

185
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:23,279
which is i these many %um 133

186
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,249
nasty much simple

187
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:31,029
and cellular connection and the same

188
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:34,309
in code into the server do with it since
then

189
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:37,598
are contest 61

190

stay or school K but you have no

191
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:45,859
really solid existing connection and you
cannot do anything

192
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:49,869
said data in a row while you're doing
are

193
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:53,519
I mean you can surf the net line coach
because otherwise

194
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,769
people lining up and what happened lives
up

195
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,549
based in the mp3 to stop playing and
when it gets

196
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:06,019
not just use start back up again start

you see

270
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:04,070
studies you only need two things:

271
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:09,909
ok stars don't need the service of don't
use our

272
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:14,130
but I don't suppose I supplies do in the
parking lot are but

so

277
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,320
the answer is question love hurts

278
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,980

302
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,970
like 20 this are questions

303
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,660
