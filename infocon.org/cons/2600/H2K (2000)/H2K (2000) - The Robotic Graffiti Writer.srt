1
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:46,079
check test new

2
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,100
okay so thank you all for coming

3
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,160
we hear from the Institute for Applied
autonomy

4
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,790
we are anonymous an anonymous a
cooperative

5
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,949
robotics collective I that stems from
being

6
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,129
in an environment and which researchers

7
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,479
completely dominated by projects which
either a

8
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,910
sir consumer optimization are civil
subjugation

9
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,200
I you know the military or

10
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,700
sellin shit send any viewer where we're
at at Zellers

11
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,180
presentation I I can just cite his and
we can like get over

12
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,240
I have to sell that stuff again

13
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,550
as the senate so good so I we're mostly
comprised a

14
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,440
on engineers computer scientists artists
designers

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,039
cultural theorists I everybody just
donates

16
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:40,399
whatever it is a skill that they have
how much time they have

17
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,600
nobody gets paid we don't have any
funding sources are comes from outta

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,179
pocket

19
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:46,310
I

20
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,160
the main initiative that we then working
on a bill at Corsa

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,330
last two years we started 98 is our call
kinda station robotics

22
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:59,090
I we've got we've got two essays here

23
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,330
available for you on a brochure
describing our projects thus far

24
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,330
cut the station robotics is developed as
an

25
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,800
as a way of bringing I kinda tell

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,300
technologically automated protest into
the streets

27
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,640
it was developed kinda parallel to

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,640
this idea that's come up a lot lately
I'm

29
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,989
electronic civil disobedience analyst

30
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:25,500
developed alongside up some of the early
electronic civil disobedience group

31
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,870
we were concerned with at the fact that

32
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,470
that's early leaves out the real world
leaves out the real public space

33
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,820
leaves out the space in which people
actually see each other face to face

34
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,780
and what's real land solidarity a gets
gets constructed we're a little worried

35
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,830
about people

36
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,209
going home and at their own individual
cubicles

37
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,630
and participating in these acts of civil
disobedience I am

38
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,340
you know outside any like real-world
localize framework

39
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,959
so are about to take place in the
streets an upset

40
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,680
um so I guess the first project going to
be talking about

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,489
is little brother I little brother was a
propaganda robot

42
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,530
developed for distributing subversive
literature to people who might otherwise

43
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,430
not take it from someone like

44
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,730
myself for you based on how you look

45
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,730
on what you have to say so this is a way
of getting people to look at your

46
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,470
message

47
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:26,360
I without even realizing they are
typologies

48
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,880
africans run that tape an hour read a
little bit from our research paper we do

49
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,910
published by the way and we presented at
the

50
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,049
international conference on robotics and
automation I

51
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,459
IEEE conference last year so for
whatever that means the

52
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,709
a so we have anything on the screen

53
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:50,630
okay okay okay

54
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,150
yeah practices like the next year

55
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,870
and i cant say no

56
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,799
tell you about a steady hand it's a
little brother was paced by

57
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,700
the aesthetics a early cited by
reviewing America and the heck

58
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,519
super cute program Japanese toy
aesthetic I

59
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,720
these particular Japanese place that is
designed specifically to help people

60
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,930
into a product who might otherwise have
a reason to

61
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,180
I

62
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,090
fetish I subject

63
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,660
so we felt this robotic uses as Tucson
arson attack

64
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,510
one a sonar pair second chairman how far
away you are

65
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:37,800
and uses inside pitch childlike voice
two more UN to take a pamphlet

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,090
we don't supply the contact for these
pamphlets typically

67
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,550
we prefer to collaborate with other
activist groups actually have something

68
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,110
to say

69
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,570
you

70
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,810
in this case we collaborated with a with
a group called the Society for

71
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,310
Reproductive anachronisms

72
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,910
their grassroots organization that
developed in response to technological

73
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,820
scientific

74
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,380
mediation the reproductive process

75
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,950
they have such campaigns and Sun
pneumatic promiscuity is where

76
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,349
I yeah insuring a diverse gene pool

77
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,250
a

78
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,090
sewing kit tilted said to connect to
people its battery operated can run for

79
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,200
something right now

80
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,969
some he got that ass itself

81
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:24,299
far longer than the average human
activity sana

82
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:28,459
point is you know it's snowing in this
case citizens really adverse conditions

83
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:35,459
but the robots not fares

84
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,620
we found that the robot was ideal at
targeting

85
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,660
the most difficult to reach target
audiences that being

86
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,200
children and senior citizens

87
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,710
unfortunately on this page on this film
we don't have a yeah

88
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,719
choices footage a seven-year-old child
taking a second pamphlets and getting

89
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,740
into his grandmother

90
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,890
I to put into Paris she's way

91
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:10,700
the so-called a that much more hang time
than the average activists get I tell

92
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,180
you

93
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:21,180
you

94
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:35,310
it

95
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:45,010
Co

96
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,039
it

97
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,940
you

98
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,020
yeah oversight

99
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,390
so he gets up the tape was pretty much
the endeavor

100
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,820
and a little brother you create the
lights I can I can see again there's

101
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,310
little

102
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,080
and bring my I guess I'm later something

103
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,400
and thank you I so in a research paper
about little brother

104
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,820
the talks about are cuteness obnoxious
scale

105
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,280
and all the other technical aspects and

106
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,310
mentions the other president
privatization of public spaces had a

107
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,440
chilling effect on activists
communications

108
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,800
as malls replace marketplaces and
parking lots replace parks

109
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,419
distributing on sanction information is
becoming an increasingly high risk and

110
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:32,940
ever

111
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,450
once protected by free speech laws
activists now face fines imprisonment

112
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,810
and bodily harm for distributed
distributing their literature and what

113
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,990
had previously been considered public
property

114
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,450
so enter the robots at

115
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,159
the second row but we had developed as
what you see here on the table and what

116
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,660
we at

117
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,560
entitled this presentation seems to be
kinda the

118
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,970
that the poster child for country
station on robotics now this is the

119
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,290
robotic graffiti writer

120
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:04,200
graffiti writer was developed an
initially

121
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,220
as a tactical robot we're basically
following right along line

122
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,590
I up the research that our colleagues
were doing for

123
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,450
effort that defense department darpa I
the idea being that

124
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:19,620
and in an environment that's too
dangerous for human to operate and

125
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,520
he sent in a robot to do the dirty work
on this case to feeding in public areas

126
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,940
especially during

127
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,729
a high-profile events a even during the
day

128
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:33,370
I were extremely on Sat sanctions faces
un sanctions faces I guess if say such

129
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,390
as shopping malls

130
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,240
federal buildings I public squares

131
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,680
the robot is ideally suited to this
environment we

132
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,440
it was earlier sections was Justin in
Pittsburgh

133
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,780
a just you're feeling down the middle of
the street that was a

134
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,470
that's just its first its first demo but
we realize that

135
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,800
when we did that that the robot
attracted all the attention

136
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,190
and the human telly operator was
absolutely

137
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,200
clear and I mean you could stand in a
public with the remote control and

138
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,320
nobody would see you you were a ghost

139
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,580
because like there's a fuckin robot
reading on the pavement like

140
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,860
a 20 feet away so that was our first

141
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,130
clue that we're onto something good I'm
with me

142
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,480
a well allegedly it was taken to

143
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,709
Washington DC by I'm some

144
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:26,950
unnamed members operatives up the IAEA
technical are tackling

145
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,370
I and I don't even know those guys are
but it was brought to the

146
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,320
a a capitol building I am and

147
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,220
it was it was deployed on the pavement
and that the car

148
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,620
sorta a this is a very elaborate plan
the %uh the car

149
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,430
the getaway vehicle would drive along
the road while the robot was sent

150
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,470
into the danger zone drop its message

151
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,620
get out car would pick it up take off in
the clear

152
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,620
I it sorta work the the

153
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,190
from what I understand the driver a the
vehicle

154
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,810
I as the robot began writing and you
could hear the robot writing

155
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,520
I headlights appeared behind the car

156
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,209
and a booming voice telling them to turn
off the engine

157
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:19,400
I which he did and a when I D
cease-fires came over and

158
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,650
you notice to put told them he operates

159
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,620
to put the item onto the sidewalk what
you did

160
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,670
and he stood there and at

161
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,670
is little different than what you see
here has had this nice form-fitting

162
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,560
black cape over the can see can really
see the can't

163
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,139
and he asked about where the federal
agents in the room

164
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:45,939
okay this is one the back that's fine
I'm so I

165
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:49,810
yes as well as are comments and 0 but we
built with a total

166
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,699
and and yes just doing what we're doing
we told her shooting a movie

167
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:58,600
the smell of paint was still thick in
the air but he was unable to

168
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,750
kinda put the whole picture together
iron

169
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,029
which which by the way and fluorescent
orange across the steps that you at the

170
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:08,500
US Capitol building red voting is few
tile

171
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,600
I and

172
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,600
and the operatives were informed to
leave the area and

173
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:23,050
trip to Philadelphia a

174
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,199
so that was our first clue our second
clue that if we had a robot we could

175
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:30,930
basically get away with anything at this
point in time

176
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,360
I which which started a new initiative

177
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,250
we're calling rogues gallery which is
where we put the technology in the hands

178
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,250
of civilians

179
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,079
and allow them to write graffiti
whatever content they wished we ate

180
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,339
we will not at a filtration system a

181
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,050
to so you know we we at actually a you
know goal

182
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,930
as the police officer use the robot to
rate we love pittsburgh police

183
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,920
for instance I'm but what what rogues
gallery was all about was putting people

184
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,719
in a position of committing crimes that
otherwise would not

185
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,149
a using this this technology and were
able to go

186
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:11,009
all over a several cities I worldwide
now actually it's been to Europe twice

187
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:12,519
and has gone back in the fall

188
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:16,990
I and put the technology enhancer for
businessmen

189
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,579
I homeless people you'll see this on the
video

190
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:24,769
but the the point was that never
everywhere we turn down

191
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:28,209
and we're able to blanket cities in
graffiti par

192
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:32,300
up all matter things that we would never
never think I've reading

193
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,329
I'm and you know

194
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:40,250
an- five minutes later we're gone the
robots gone but you know the graffiti is

195
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:40,870
there

196
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,220
for you can you know a month two months
it's not

197
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,029
it's not super Prince Alec and mammal
pains and stop the construction crews

198
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:48,610
use

199
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,120
acted like the last thing we want to do
is kinda build more monuments

200
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,029
that are already out there so these are
nice no temporal

201
00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:00,160
a messages that are that are kinda
burned in the people's consciousness is

202
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,689
for

203
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:05,349
for timing go away so I guess now would
be the appropriate time

204
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,910
to to run video began to play again

205
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,839
problem you're really uncomfortable
black leader on the tape

206
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:19,199
up to fill the air now those and I was
our first logo

207
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:23,949
I know somewhere I am a while

208
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:27,019
cool away as a first look at this a
second mother

209
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:30,120
again this time lol applied autonomy

210
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,459
was founded in 1998 as a technological
research and development organization

211
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,959
dedicated to the cause a individual and
collective

212
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,459
self-determination our mission is to
study the courses

213
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:47,179
and structures which affects
self-determination and to develop

214
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:48,129
technologies

215
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:51,569
which extend the Academy humid activists

216
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:55,620
this initiative known as contest ational
robotics

217
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,959
inverts the traditional relationship
between robots

218
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,629
and authoritarian power structures by
meeting the needs

219
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:06,860
and budgets of resistant forces the
current focus

220
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,230
up this initiative is the robotic
graffiti writer

221
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,009
graffiti writer was developed as a
tactical streak weapon

222
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:17,439
which could further extend the abilities
up human activists

223
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:21,240
to participate in a real-world public
acts up subversion

224
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,290
while retaining essential out of range
anonymity

225
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,589
graffiti writer as a teller operated
robot

226
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:30,730
which employs a customers to rate them
spray cans

227
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,170
breaking your text messages on the
ground at awake

228
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,730
15 alive power robot

229
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,540
can be deployed in any highly controlled
space or public event

230
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:46,099
from a remote location what's graffiti
writer is navigated

231
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,490
into place a push-button triggers the
high-speed

232
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,809
pretty process the robot

233
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,860
is then navigated to a secluded pick up
area

234
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,319
or simply considered a worthy sacrifice
in the name

235
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:02,769
of robotic objection

236
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,199
in addition to the scope for
applications

237
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,569
the graffiti writer project brings the
power mediated criminal experience

238
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:13,569
to a wide audience a poll troll
participants well

239
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:16,759
recently I AA

240
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:20,419
researchers the point the graffiti
writer a series of public space

241
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:25,839
experiments this field testing revealed
that in nearly 100 percent up the cases

242
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,049
a given agent up the public would
willingly participate

243
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:33,309
in high-profile acts of vandalism given
the opportunity to do so

244
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:36,329
be a mediated tell a robotic technology

245
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:41,739
test cases who violated local ordinances
governing graffiti in public areas

246
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:48,739
included students municipal workers a

247
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,680
people 5 guy

248
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,610
Girl Scouts and others yeah

249
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:06,600
in Institute for Applied autonomy is
currently accepting applications for its

250
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,550
spring and summer 2000

251
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:15,550
research program the

252
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:21,770
thank you

253
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,960
assets graffiti writer

254
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,650
right now the current research in
progress

255
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,010
is a row but for lack of a better name
for calling StreamReader

256
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:35,680
and this is about four times the with

257
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,730
exactly four times the with up graffiti
writer but

258
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,050
is mounted on the bottom have an
existing car

259
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,720
so its it so it's a different tactical
paradigm it's not about

260
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,610
the thing looks like a robot so we can
get away with it is about the bank

261
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,680
doesn't look like a robot so I can get
away with it iron

262
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,110
the first generational probably be
mounted on tobacco

263
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,730
a sixty-two black Cadillac just cuz I
really like that idea

264
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:06,060
a it'll be 20 cans wider will be able to
print simple graphics which

265
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,530
graffiti writers not really able to do
other than Mike smiley faces

266
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,129
and checkerboard I it'll be a prank
texts that are legible

267
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,990
from the drivers managing like this fire
lane messages

268
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:22,000
at a loss to be able to print text
horizontally like graffiti writer does

269
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,260
it'll be visible from top holdings
low-flying aircraft and thats

270
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,390
that spending research we have to be
finished with that in our guests and

271
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,150
will bring it to a town near you and

272
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,270
so that's that's it for like the
currently in progress

273
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:44,170
ongoing actually build shit kinda
research but we've got some conceptual

274
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,220
sorta vaporware projects on the horizon
I which is actually probably more

275
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,980
critical

276
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,470
to you guys cuz that's why we're here
Mercer these are more

277
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,760
II based more on software intensive
projects

278
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,850
and so does give you a brief rundown of
what we're talking about and if you have

279
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,209
these skills

280
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,990
a approaches afterwards and we would
love to work with you

281
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,660
I'm if you don't have the skills but you
just interested that's great but

282
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,890
we really need people with that have the
skills

283
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,510
already I so basically what we're
talking about

284
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,810
is a modes inverse surveillance

285
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:22,169
I'm turning surveillance systems back on
themselves are using material that's

286
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,150
already there to monitor the monitors

287
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:28,740
so a you can effectively call this cop
watch nursed kinda two strains that

288
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,920
we're talking about here

289
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,300
one is automated monitoring police
radios

290
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,010
using voice recognition searching for
police codes

291
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,440
and addresses it's a very noisy signal
so this is a big problem for speech

292
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,560
recognition right now

293
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,480
but which we can overcome that because
it is such a limited vocabulary were

294
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,010
talking about you can actually

295
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,129
build a real time map a

296
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,650
where police are being called to
intervene at any given time

297
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,010
and you can make that Matt publicly
available you can also make it available

298
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,480
on a per per-user basis

299
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,520
I E you have an eight hundred-number you
call that number

300
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,600
on you give the number a time and like
you know a quadrant of the city

301
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,030
and a pager number and you can be paged
I F there's going to be an intervention

302
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,480
occurring in your area give you got a
thirty second head start

303
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:26,480
so this has obvious applications to

304
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,070
high school kids who wanna drink a
graffiti writers

305
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,649
I am you know all all manner for

306
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,650
would become delinquent youths and

307
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,860
and criminals and and everybody else has
good ideas into so on cops around

308
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,210
prayer I mean that's a

309
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,620
so that's one project the other another
strain at that is simply visual

310
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,750
identification a automated visual
identification of police officers based

311
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,720
on their uniforms

312
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,400
and their vehicles this is partly
inspired by projects such as

313
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,510
the video surveillance and monitoring
project on

314
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,720
which is going on a number of different
universities

315
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,920
and his basically just automated
monitoring a public space

316
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,970
where yet by a video cameras where
persons can be

317
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,040
I isolated in the image from other
vehicles

318
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,889
signed an ID potentially night
triangulate your face and

319
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,230
notice and facial recognition on it as
well we're not

320
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,610
really interested in people wonder and
public spaces or more interested and

321
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:31,700
watching the cops so thats another
project anybody has any experience

322
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,460
and I video signal a analysis

323
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,930
I am that's pretty much

324
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:42,210
all I got here I will we got a bunch of
stuff and we're gonna be set up a table

325
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,090
out there

326
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,139
i right afterwards and I don't know if
I'll be honest and hair

327
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,240
but we've got brochures that scribe all
the projects

328
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,900
I got our web address on it which is to
be W dot applied

329
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,270
autonomy dot com both to the videos are
there in a number of different streaming

330
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,770
formats and QuickTime

331
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,980
Anish pictures all the papers are there
I

332
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,300
and we've also got these things I

333
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,700
which is a kinda low-tech alternative

334
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,210
I you know got all this technology and
his other ways of getting at these

335
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,290
problems

336
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:19,750
these are ads that are four this get
those ads that are appearing on a backup

337
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,590
gas pump handles everywhere

338
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,620
and really interesting a paradigm

339
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,090
company called billboard at you to feel
bored dot com

340
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,720
I'll tell you all about a how valuable
it is to have a captive audience for

341
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,050
three minutes while the pump the gas
tank and go to the snack shop

342
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:39,570
so these little stickers here you can
cut out pilaf paste over the existing at

343
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,820
and it's a public service announcement
from exxon explaining how to use their

344
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,600
fuel manufactured not up cocktails

345
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:52,600
a

346
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,080
but beyond that I don't know what kinda
time schedule running on earth who like

347
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,830
we're screwing by being here

348
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,580
I I'd like to answer questions what's at

349
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,129
Co exile excite pick up

350
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,640
so an official questions here or outside
but there's some hands up national

351
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,560
income

352
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,800
okay

353
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,550
well Sep sacrificing it would

354
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,180
right right right

355
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,310
and then when he can manufacture at very
very true a

356
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,510
in terms of parts we're just lookin at
like

357
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,060
a grand over the course of you know it's
like eight months to build

358
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:42,200
and there's several iterations in there
so if we had to do it again

359
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,720
be a the parts price that actually
probably close to half that

360
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,460
I but that's not the real sink the sink
is the time in the skills it takes to

361
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,330
build it

362
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,610
and that you know we can't just like
replicate

363
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:57,210
other we try to make as much as the
information about it publicly available

364
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,200
as possible

365
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,460
are source code schematics

366
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,510
I little things that we learn but
obviously the

367
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,510
that the machining skills here's a
pretty rarefied skill

368
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:14,510
and it's not something you're gonna find
no anywhere

369
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,639
yeah okay it's basically
field-programmable we step to look

370
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,310
around the laptop with us

371
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:26,030
program in a message sent in all types
they'll print that message as many times

372
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,850
as you want it

373
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,100
but we have reduced things down recently

374
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,270
so that now as we have is a a Hewlett
Packard 48g

375
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:39,639
running a terminal I that's all we need

376
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:46,640
a I think getting at before

377
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,320
I mean like like robot mapping okay yeah
those are we were actually brought that

378
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,710
up in the original paper

379
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,230
which is another reason see low brother
so big I would

380
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,430
I mean I know it is to lug that thing
around

381
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:03,740
a the event it would be very simple also
put just a little switch on the bottom

382
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,570
of it so the net when it is lifted
lifted off the ground it

383
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,720
triggers a siren or now we thought about
doing the same thing with a little

384
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,660
brother coulda

385
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,790
could empty the cans you know when it
lifted off the ground by somebody

386
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,230
doesn't have the right key

387
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,260
and say others step deterrents

388
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:26,260
we could do is have a problem yet

389
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:34,370
but it's the slapping on part that's a
lot harder than it sounds

390
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:41,370
ok it will

391
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,879
ok it was okay there's a camera there's
the antenna box

392
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:55,360
and there's the electronics and then the
in the central

393
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,139
central part of the body at the chassis
is the tough the tough part to build

394
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:00,980
this whole suspension system you see
here

395
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,600
I'm the system %uh the sole nights his
electromagnets that actuate the cans

396
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,909
I'm its it's a to precision device I

397
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:12,470
the car originally just say no was a
clotbuster

398
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,029
I but we've basically reduced it down to
its wheels

399
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:19,570
I Motors and gearboxes and thats there's
nothing else original

400
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,610
on here I so

401
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,639
getting a quote clotbuster will get you
there but it's not even

402
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:29,139
halfway was our experience anyway but
good luck to you

403
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:34,330
I'm sorry okay

404
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,860
at that question if you couldn't figured
out was a

405
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,419
I what's the hard part I think question

406
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:48,419
and in the back

407
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,800
only open source everything to begin
with with me with we don't keep any

408
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,090
secrets if that's what you mean

409
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:15,090
so we're more interested in and just
getting it out a

410
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:27,619
using to get the message I mean like
identities

411
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:35,779
owners like like well okay ripping off
the idea is that so they

412
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:42,779
question

413
00:26:53,899 --> 00:27:00,899
house somebody potentially countering
the technology

414
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:09,300
well I mean the effective
countermeasures like you know peaked

415
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:09,790
roof

416
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:16,790
pavement ray a ok

417
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:23,170
okay I mean I i suppose it's possible
but they really wouldn't need

418
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,360
if they were interested in developing a
counter system they wouldn't really need

419
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,390
to steal it because

420
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,160
like I say we do keep everything all the
information is public

421
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,600
I'm a somebody really took that kind of
interest in us and in a very good sign a

422
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:42,600
and we could probably figure out a way
around that

423
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:48,210
any any worker protection now not solve
she

424
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,770
wide open him

425
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:57,770
the hell's going to snap this

426
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:03,720
ok it is a good question is asking

427
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,720
yep

428
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,039
rate is asking about the potential

429
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:13,100
for the business world to caught this
idea

430
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,169
and kind of you know these things and up
everywhere like you know you gotta

431
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:19,999
cuts on this robot's putting on the
ground yeah I mean

432
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:23,830
yeah you know we're not gonna copyright
it's not like we're not gonna trademark

433
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,439
anything

434
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,809
I thats that sorta

435
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:31,519
apart in a problem a our a part of the
solution I don't know which

436
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,009
IMF if these things are manufactured in
available at Radio Shack would that be a

437
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:35,659
good thing

438
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:38,840
I don't know I'm I kinda don't think so
you know I think

439
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,600
it works because there's only a couple
but you know if they're everywhere

440
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,639
in a you just see pepsi ads on the
ground and that's not good

441
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:49,779
I mean have you seen these machines on
the beach is now that the train ads in

442
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:50,539
the sand

443
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:55,200
alright think about back

444
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:02,200
rare at the dispense over there

445
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:09,350
their messages right

446
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:22,330
great it it's true if somebody actually
manufacture something similar enough to

447
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,269
it there is a %uh this you know a whole
new

448
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:27,929
a realm a packing possibilities

449
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:31,130
for us right because right now but like
bank a whole lot of

450
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,389
hola in the way of the shop robotics
that actually do

451
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:38,009
anything I so when we get there things
get more interesting

452
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:43,279
we didn't want to run a demo the robot
I'm wanted to do it in here so maybe

453
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,000
maybe now's the time and if you have any
real questions are

454
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,370
wanna talk anymore will be here for like
least another couple hours over in the

455
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,750
other room up a table set up

456
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,259
so a yet when I like that the people the
front row and maybe even

457
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:59,850
I think it just the people in the front
row thinking like rather shares

458
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:04,129
and kinda taken to the sides and open up
the space you're gonna roll down some

459
00:30:04,129 --> 00:30:11,129
paper

460
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,080
on by the way it's always our policy
when we doing these things in public

461
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,399
spaces that we

462
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,800
we really hate coming up for the content
on our own

463
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,400
on so I I was kinda hoping like a manual
be around

464
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,220
now his check but hey on

465
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,700
