of people being intimidating when we saw

144
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,300
it

145
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,910
it wasn't just the significant hack but

146
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:32,550
a reaction that some people were having
in kuwait people were being made to take

147
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,130
down

148
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,400
source code and the any excuse from
their website

149
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,650
without what we felt was really am

150

for for a while kinda sad there until
I'm

171
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,420
until I guess it was December when the
California

172
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,469
case was announced a esperança

173
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,300
and the DVD CC a file charges Anne

174
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,150
that didn't affect us much obviously us
they thought it'd

175
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,880
place tentative here in New York in
there in california nahi tu

176
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,380
much file charges against us in a local
court in California

177
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,640
just doesn't work out that way and yen's
and there's a hearing I guess

178
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,480
news there's a hearing during our stay
in Santa Clara

179
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,870
and and then like the day after that
hearing

180
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,740
we all want to went to Lompoc California
and Southern California

181
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,920
Picasa kevin Mitnick was getting at
least actually

182
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,500
actually if you're in the finest part
when we actually complain that we have

183
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:43,920
taken

184
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,890
we know we are creating players MPAA
this is an interesting story because

185
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,120
I was driving around somewhere new
jersey in nineteen and Mackey call me on

186
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,750
the phone

187
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,130
say hey guess what you've been named as
they

188
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,530
as a defendant in a lawsuit by the NBA
in the using the DMCA

189
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,680
to to through their case you like that

190
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,120
how he got sir scanning yeah then they
what this not this was on a Friday

191
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,780
I think it was Friday that the 14 th
January I got the call from mackey I was

192
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,270
about

193
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,980
maybe five o'clock PM as I was driving
out somewhere in New Jersey

194
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,200
and I in this is a three-day weekend of
the holiday weekend

195
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,770
Martin Luther King's birthday I'm
thinking there was Monday so

196
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,430
these guys came to where 2600 is

197
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,160
you where where people were tom has
arisen new jersey in other people were

198
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,569
doing other things

199
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,940
and basically they just cant through the
papers into the doorway

200
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,829
apparently that's that meets the
requirements serving some money these

201
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:38,890
days you actually have to

202
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:43,050
handed to them anyway just pitch in the
doorway and the dog ate it or whatever

203
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,390
and so another new jersey being served
without knowing it

204
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,640
I'll when I get home later that night hi

205
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,240
the actual paperwork on we have

206
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,230

a.m. on

207
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,240
on Wednesday that we had to file a
response to that

208
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,900
monday was a holiday let us one day to
get legal representation get or paper in

209
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,680
order is no way anybody could do that

210
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,970
and as before we we had margaret was on
our side but there was still no way

211
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,730
that could be done that fast at that
point and plus plus that was the day

212
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,209
that

213
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:19,730
kevin Mitnick was being released in
California so all of us write a

214
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,160
californian Inglis

215
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,610
yeah and and we were told to what
happened skipping ahead with you handle

216
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:25,900
me

217
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,510
effects Ford a tree that so is that was
on Friday

218
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,209
at the last possible minute that we find
out where being sued

219
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:36,579
well that Tuesday which is the first
business day

220
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:41,810
up that's the hearing in California and
I'm actually based on california's I was

221
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,000
there now a string RCA's

222
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,270
a lot of fun by Tom

223
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:52,120
the entire in the EFSF legal team was
completely busy

224
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,500
preparing for tuesday to force the MPAA
new day

225
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,240
because you know they're working very
closely with the ECCA which i think is

226
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,300
something like total one or two people
comprised entirely

227
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,209
DVD shi'a and down

228
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:12,550
and say yes we basically had about maybe
twenty hours from

229
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,079
back Tuesday night to wednesday morning
China pair

230
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,870
meanwhile world on the way out the door
Tuesday night

231
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,640
to go to LA in Psych there's just no way

232
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,270
and so while we were in Los Angeles

233
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:32,020
a the hearing took place in New York and
we had %uh

234
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,040
one of the one is that

235
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,780
people who were named in the california
complain happen to be a lawyer

236
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,910
based in New York and so he was able to

237
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,280
being a member New York Bar was able to
represent us in court

238
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,740
and then arm I'll yet to represent al

239
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,350
running gross and Alan levy I believe or

240
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,959
are also on the hearing via telephone

241
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,260
and in very short matters the judge
granted a preliminary injunction

242
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,630
and we got a phone call lower at liking
it some hotel

243
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,100
in a in Lompoc Calif she's middle of
nowhere

244
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,770
and s where you get informed that we
have to take the code of site

245
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:21,060
or will go to jail SS mean get this
intent able for kevin is being really

246
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,670
need for planning a celebration

247
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,530
and it's like in its federal court to
English landed by US marshals were about

248
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,980
to go to a prison

249
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,230
and they know who we are in there ready
for us

250
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:36,890
and so up it's like 10 hours before his
time each night before

251
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,660
we have to drive 30 miles the next
Halloween Havoc Eagles

252
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,069
and of course I'd I just happened to be
taken one time I travel light

253
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,400
don't bring a laptop or anything

254
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,670
which like calling in half points is it
means in New York

255
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,510
change password so that we can like
change back again so we can login from

256
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,959
in secure machine we had like the
injunction fax to us

257
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:03,530
and we spent spend all night basically
taking it up

258
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:08,020
writing an article going through like
prepping for links to its a decade

259
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,449
backup old copies just like

260
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:15,780
you just arm up the code

261
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,599
and and then change the link to point to
the news story

262
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,260
about the injunction going into place NS

263
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,520
very very 10 trying very stressful

264
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,860
and then the FDA has the nerve to say
that we don't take injunction seriously

265
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,610
hit me we spent hours kinko's changing

266
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,920
changes the site around and complete
destroying ourselves the next day we

267
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,430
were

268
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,170
trying to be happy about having finally
being released are then they try to go

269
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,980
after a strong links

270
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,540
I guess because say they fail you so far
more

271
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,409
the judge actually on so we get after
you get down at we got back and things

272
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,920
got settled down a bit

273
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,280
on it is he December 27

274
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,780
we posted a story see about how you can
help kinda what's going on

275
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,800
and we put out a call keep merely in
really

276
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,809
I mean there is no way that they could
possibly

277
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:13,110
eradicate the CSS named out there for
months and months

278
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,160
and nearing campaign was really just
kind of Tat

279
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,940
call attention just how many somewhere
out there n

280
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:25,540
and highlight the futility of it all and
also shows a little solidarity shell

281
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,300
much support we had and down

282
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,340
and in those snitch weeks we got me
lunch in the first couple days you know

283
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,860
jump exponentially as hundreds and
hundreds coming in

284
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,920
and and I'm yesterday

285
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,080
filed to amend the complaint trying sale

286
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,870
there trafficking it by linking to it
shell try and the judge actually

287
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,990
to discredit had reservations about
nineteen not

288
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:57,380
granted and I still pending the motion
still pending till

289
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,470
I guess earlier this week last week

290
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,490
when he issued in order to combine the
motion to

291
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,309
stop linking with the trial itself cell

292
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:12,840
arm for now the standing me stopped
updating in a while ago

293
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,280
show-bizzy kinda made a point

294
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,040
all you really need is one you know it's
funny because like

295
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,330
if are firm mission here was really
trying

296
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,730
worried about preserving it not showing
how many had

297
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,730
it was so easy for them to go down the
list and just kill shot season since

298
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,140
last

299
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,590

311
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,870
sites

312
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,650
week post em one at a time or maybe five
at a time

313
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,290
in a scene is that one goes down take
money 2000

314
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,830
missions and put out laughing and we
have enough

315
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,960
within the first week and had enough
they would have known it was there for

316
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,030
like a good five years the kitties keep

317
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,100
adding a new line every week when one
gets them

318
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,550
platinum we're really you know Pirates
like they say we are we were simply

319
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,940
not told them and had our little circles
pirate straight years whenever they

320
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,679
think we do

321
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,960
they never would have been wiser but by
by posting up on the site were showing

322
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,330
the world hey you know people like a
standard is kinda crappy being told

323
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,449
that source code is illegal at a lot of
people really shows and gots

324
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,510
like a lot of high school kids lives I
employees companies a lot of

325
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,290
powerful people to just stood up to to I
consider to be

326
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,620
12 worst forms repression being tall
what you can and cannot say

327
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,250
and that's why we got involved in the
story from the beginning because we saw

328
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,730
we saw police inaction we don't like
bullies and we try to

329
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,290
always call attention to an end the bad
part about this is we did so caught up

330
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,940
defending ourselves in a lot of things
have been going on

331
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,400
that we have been able to devote enough
time to a lot of other cases

332
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,140
also involving DMCA or you know the the
use of the NCAA

333
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:38,900
against the people and we just have to
devote enough time to its old

334
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,630
basically we need to expand our
resources or a

335
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,900
for more people need to do this action
think more people doing this

336
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,130
but you have to understand is a risky
really is known that

337
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,380
this could happen since day one
publishing a magazine that some company

338
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,230
can get really pissed off at us

339
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,470
except we didn't know it would be this
many of them at once

340
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,280
me he just have no idea at the size that
we

341
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,389
we're dealing with here this is like you
know this is like coming up against

342
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,410
I don't know i think is any human being

343
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,290
your bill gates was forced by this this
is this is

344
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:17,620
every company that puts out motion
pictures and they own media

345
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,700
they do mean CNN is owned by Time Warner
they're suing us

346
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,059
at least those on the bizarre things in
the world mean the whole situation is

347
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,990
surely a while we were in Lompoc

348
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:31,400
but down there is a no huge press corps
that assemble on this tiny town to a

349
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,650
to witness mitnick being released and
yet at least you like

350
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,240
30 different news crew satellite trucks
microwave and send them

351
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,300
and as they were integrating like

352
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,320
were assuring them around town and this
motorcade following us

353
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,770
and it so that's prime it into the film

354
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,100
and meanwhile every time they reviewing
its okay you know you guys are still in

355
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,580
its right

356
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,110
ever every press they're waiting for
their own in the pic

357
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,610
little local tape rock I remember this
the local paper and it's like

358
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:08,240
mob CNN's ABC entertainment talk to hey
you're not seeing as I'll talk to you

359
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,200
they were they were really turned out
okay

360
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,250
yeah but it's its masses

361
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,309
it's really incredible every broadcast
network

362
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:23,389
I mean ABC somebody Disney is now suing
a CBS owned by viacom viacom suing us

363
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,679
asking the public broadcasting service
is suing us yet they're probably

364
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:29,370
involved some point its

365
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,940
it's scary and you know it's really
kinda makes you worry about

366
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,540
everything that happens are because
these people are so lemme ask the

367
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,059
powerful

368
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:40,460
I had to go to a deposition a couple
weeks ago has basically we sit in front

369
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:40,820
of

370
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:45,970
hostile lawyer serious hostile re:
stares at you for about eight hours a

371
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,020
day and ask you pointed questions

372
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,020
and I actually had to these lawyers
asking pointed questions

373
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,559
many the revolving around the integrity
of 2600 how

374
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,530
how we exist only to promote crime and
things like that and you know I had to

375
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,620
answer that crap for

376
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,010
for a good long time and try to explain
it to them without success

377
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,600
what the purpose a free information is
on

378
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,420
and on my way up to see these people of
over the course of two days

379
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,780
on I had to go to the 25th floor up
their building which is right in Times

380
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,280
Square

381
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,678
Proskauer Rose the biggest law firms in
the galaxy

382
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:24,460
and the the elevator stopping everything
on this twenty five floors every single

383
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,120
one is 25 flaws in a big Proskauer Rose
thing

384
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,710
you know on the wall they had all floors
in the building and

385
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,980
all these lawyers in their hundreds
thousands of them

386
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,120
and a good number I'm just focusing
their attention against

387
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,320
us hacker corley he felt little

388
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,350
seen that publishes you know to eat a
few thousand people in Psych how did we

389
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,300
become

390
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,809
the enemy have Hollywood I don't know

391
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:52,210
and you know watching jack valenti
testified

392
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,640
in are deposition where we asked him
pointed questions

393
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,980
which he knew the answer to 90 this is
awfully weird because he this is the

394
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,910
same jack valenti allegedly that that

395
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,760
wrote articles in newspapers in press
releases at that pretty much pointed me

396
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,679
out by name

397
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,190
saying that I was the ringleader a
buncha Pirates and then when asked on

398
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,110
the stand

399
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,080
who's a manual calls to his no idea he
did successfully

400
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,110
recognizes own pictures the

401
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:24,460
its

402
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,010
so what we're dealing with some unknown

403
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:33,250
quantities here are we should we stop
order to

404
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,260
to Tian the situation or what

405
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,340
how did the media covering over there

407
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,669
pretty much biaz just like in US

408
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:53,940

409
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,110

Houston the top actress something
criminal so

412
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,350
know while since they

413
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:14,440
mention it news now but they were

414
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,320
they weren't very much willing to get it
right

415
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,490
say some national earlier did usually
have

416
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:28,000
happen image apollo they want to percent
story before the stock

other TCS costs to an anti Style Sheets

425
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,490
and the big guy University regular calls
because you've been hearing that

426
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:09,660
on his website we will miss just to
clarify their some people have been

427
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,220
posting

428
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,290
the CSS but is that really is it just
has the file name

429
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:18,270
and they've actually gotten letters from
the MPAA CSS

430
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,940
early if you have any file your website
called the CSS NBA's can be sending you

431
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,429
a letter

432
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:26,300
yet just three ss pristine cascading
style sheets

433
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,620
and and every move that hey

434
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,350

it like happy bunny dots

437
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,480

they've wasted lot by

438
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,970
we know they've wasted a lot of time on
that to let you know we have to bring

439
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:52,440
ellen

440
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,850
verify mirrors before we put them up on
that thing actually

441
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,340
took so long it takes nice little wet
form people unexpected they're just be

442
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,090
automatic

443
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:04,650
but we launched be reason we can from
King

444
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,919
really filter all like these make sure
the files there

445
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,030
chopping up bad links and

446
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:14,240
in it that made it harder she finds a

447
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,320
allow the site school this guy you know
he saying all these good

448
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,629

455
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,519

if we back down as yes

456
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,619
that's actually make how much it hard
for us to do that is how far you guys

457
00:28:56,619 --> 00:29:01,549
willing to go for this and a side note

how far you guys really long ago lol

462
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:24,569
arm we'll pay injunctions when you know
injunction filed against us we we obey

463
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:25,049
them

464
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:28,399
and we're gonna fight this you know
until it's

465
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,309
its ruled illegal to basically the way
for it we're going about the link issue

466
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:38,769
when it was a possibility that links
were going to be

467
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:42,589
outlawed when judge will be issued
against us saying we can have a link

468
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:43,379
studies

469
00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:47,889
sites re: response to that would've been
to simply not making links to simply

470
00:29:47,889 --> 00:29:48,389
make them

471
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:51,919
list Lister sites

472
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,349
battling lyle some some word processors
and and HTML

473
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:59,948
automatically makes it into a link but
you know that's our problem

474
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:04,469
so then they would have to come after us
and say you can't miss you can't list

475
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,249
sites

476
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:09,049
so okay then we take the list and then
we put into a conversational form talk

477
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:10,199
about it they say

478
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:13,249
know you can even talk about it so what
we gonna push them all the way to the

479
00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:14,259
age where they say

480
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:21,259
we can even think about this

481
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,970
now is another funny thing about linking
Islam

482
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:31,480
you know you look at the the reply Cup
the comments on the library Congress

483
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,220
state unit

484
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,180
question question here a week it's Mitt
you always think exemption should be

485
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,680
made to the DNC a

486
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:43,380
and now they're all posted library
congress' website in PDF form and

487
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,890
a lot of people up included URL's

488
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:50,490
and Adobe Acrobat actually no recognizes
at

489
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,960
highlighting gets a link also up

490
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,010
numerous plaintiffs run search engines

491
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:02,440
for instance info see is owned by Disney
there are a lot so cool thanks

492
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:09,440
to decs on in KC I think everybody in
the room knows that this is

493
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,380
all about this entire case is about a
lot more than just the CSS

494
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,290
I wonder if you could talk about with
regards to technology in general

495
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:26,290
what is it you're hoping to accomplish
with this case almost

496
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:32,270
like a I think I'll a large part of it

497
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,970
is not losing existing freedoms %uh

498
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:40,540
do just due to new technology Ulm in a
lovely

499
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:44,700
DVD's course the on the knee mediate
case it's rather obvious that there's

500
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:44,970
the

501
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,390
fair use limitations and all those
things but I mean from the perspective

502
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,640
that we got involved in this

503
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,950
as a free speech issue arm

504
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,380
it's definitely any

505
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,720
that is just multifaceted you have

506
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,790
the speech posting source code

507
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:08,120
you also have arm just the freedom in
general that isn't necessarily

508
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,910
technologically related

509
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:14,170
love not bowing to not kowtowing to

510
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:17,520
baseless cease and desist letters in
censorship

511
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,810
and taking things down we need really
don't have to

512
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:24,389
because you don't want the headache and
I think when we posted it

513
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:29,890
we're really am trying to stand up for
people who are in other countries who

514
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,480
are getting

515
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,740
letters from from the MPAA

516
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:38,780
and I'll and SB Nike I know I'm
completely right but i cant do anything

517
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,340
about it

518
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:43,560
and and we can it really felt was an
obligation

519
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,050
that for all the preaching sign in all
the rhetoric

520
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:51,270
dad if we don't seize an opportunity
like that to help

521
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,970
arm it's all worthless netbook really

522
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:58,210
Muzzin any other option that's exactly
it its

523
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,740
we do have an obligation because a lot
of people out there

524
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,420
they they make a stand and we see this
all the time we see some kid in

525
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,670
highschool make a stand

526
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:10,200
by doing something simple like putting
out his own newsletter or having a

527
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,090
website is critical at this school

528
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,910
you know all kinds of things and they
get completely destroyed by

529
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,840
by the authorities again you know thrown
at school penalized in various ways

530
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,680
and how much further can they go the

531
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,000
basically a lot of people have to give
up we understand

532
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,930
we put ourselves in a position where we
challenged certain injustices

533
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:35,070
we publish information and

534
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:38,600
we have to fight for that right we can't
just continue doing in expected always

535
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,060
to be there they're going to be those
people that try to take that right away

536
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,760
from us

537
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,100
and so it's our obligation to stay there
you know it's a

538
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,570
we're going to continue doing this and
you can have to change the constitution

539
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,389
change the laws

540
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,660
to make it illegal for us to do what we
do and that's

541
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,070
that's the obligation we take very
seriously Salam

542
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,669
hopefully at will be somewhat successful
is money

543
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,100
a young because your rest you become
kind the poster boy for all this

544
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,320
wanna see a your first of all

545
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,418
to what extent did you are what was your
role and

546
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:14,799
development TCS you know how much will
do you have

547
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,419
also do you regret it now well i

548
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:25,500
the dead actually reverse engineering
was done by the German member of more

549
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:31,580
he said identities unknown asked me I
don't know who he is

550
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,918
and he didn't actually reverse
engineering and

551
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:38,540
I I a used that his work to create

552
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,980
actual application I also was
responsible dist

553
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,379
for distributing it and

554
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:50,020
enough to understand I think it was to
have done the same I'm not

555
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,080
such best change in its you're here in
the US

556
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,350
but you're in the US

557
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:01,220
hey welcomes is waiting

558
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,340
but them even if they're

559
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,760
the Maxxum County for the charge them
facing thats

560
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,590
to three years and district attorney
District Attorney

561
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:17,570
has said that I am public at most just
facing

562
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:21,850
fine and in no way fine sir based on

563
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,920
income the previous year I didn't own
income loss there's

564
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,920
the

565
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:43,020
she the secret is to be four remember
that my question is this is

566
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,240
clearly a free speech issue and even
though you guys

567
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,990
the defendants is eventually an effect
on us but

568
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:53,500
uniting the last person to read about
how many media companies

569
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,190
on and Control Alt me in the world was
known Chomsky said something like forty

570
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,420
for instance in there

571
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,970
and I don't know how many mergers so the
question is essentially up against these

572
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,590
24 Company's control all its resources
me in the world

573
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:10,290
how do you advise people like us the
little people to fight

574
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:14,970
I think our keynote speaker says it best
you will be off early says become the

575
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:15,410
media

576
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:19,129
publisher on seeing make your own radio
station

577
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:22,960
do what they're not doing get the word
out however you can

578
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,110
is no reason why they can't be more
magazines like what what we do

579
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:30,050
is planning information out there are
plenty of things to talk about and

580
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:34,080
believe in the strength in numbers when
it comes to to dream speech sold by all

581
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,569
means

582
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:41,570
become the media its

583
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:49,270
one as hell it became umpa versus manual
goldstein rather than 2600

584
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,430
it's not michael eisner versus yeah I
know it's weird isn't

585
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:57,359
you know I always thought that being a
corporation that ID shielded individual

586
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,580
but rarely works that way if you're big
corporations this just

587
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,390
if you sue Microsoft united to get bill
gates assets but

588
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:08,960
apparently 2600 issued and you know my
house goes up to the MPAA

589
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,930
fucked up with an essay homes

590
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:17,310
again I'm not a techie cell in a sense

591
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:20,910
it's an advantage in the room for the
khakis I'm not attacking

592
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:24,710
I don't understand the issues as well as
many people do

593
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,260
in this audience I would pose two
questions to you the first is

594
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:34,340
do you think it was wise to antagonise
or what do you think it was

595
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,660
lies to link your website to

596
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,920
in view of the fact that you had a judge
may not have been

597
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,390
fully familiar with the issues and did
you not risk antagonizing the judge by

598
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,259
doing

599
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:53,360
keeping in mind he people around here
saying what should we do

600
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,290
ultimately these issues a1 were lost in
Port

601
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:02,620
it's going to be one or lost in court
when you is that freedom of speech issue

602
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,589
whether to copyright issue

603
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,660
is not at all clear line by

604
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,279
it's gonna be the judges decisions
whether it goes up

605
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,480
to the Supreme Court or not whether you
win or lose the people in this room

606
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,700
winner wins

607
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:21,110
their right to do things that you think
they have the right to do was it wise to

608
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:26,650
to intact risk antagonizing the church
fight linking the website and secondly

609
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:30,060
in listening to your attorneys both

610
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,560
that the mail attorney seen elegant and
the female attorney seen

611
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,560
elegant but aren't they able to
articulate the issues

612
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,060
to an online technical judge to judge
you

613
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,790
doesn't was not a techie has to come
away and make a decision regarding

614
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,790
technical issue technical sayings I they
going to

615
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:56,630
put in listening to their arguments I'm
not at all convinced

616
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:00,120
I'm not sure whether this is an issue
freedom of speech

617
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,920
versus I another issue

618
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,330
is the judge gonna be clear at the end
of the day

619
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:11,299
withstand arguing your case that thats
that's what we're trying to do that's

620
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,210
the toughest part in the case obviously
is trying to make it understandable

621
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:17,380
I there's a flip side to that the the

622
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,760
plaintiffs also have to make it
understandable and a lot of what they

623
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,110
say is I nonsense and the judge can see
that

624
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,310
I your first question though arm

625
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:30,290
I I find the worst type is censorship to
be self censorship

626
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:33,340
and that's something that we have to be
very careful not to say all

627
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:37,250
if we do this it might result in this so
when I can say it at all

628
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:44,250
we had to we had to put up lights that
was acts

629
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:48,279
we didn't link send all the sudden

630
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,160
is just for closing the door on the
whole case they were basically just

631
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,259
agree not to talk about something
anymore links are vital links or

632
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,420
how you you point to your source of
information that's what the weather is

633
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,119
all about

634
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,860
and to just say to to agree be forced to
sign up on that

635
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,540
yet links would be considered to be
illegal in a case like this

636
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:11,619
now we want the judge to tell us links
for illegal alright and he has not done

637
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:13,990
that to his credit to his credit he is
said that

638
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,300
he's not going to rule on at this point
in the trial itself now

639
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,610
another thing and I just increases with
the judge but I do think that he does

640
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,700
understand a few very basic premises

641
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,280
on the MPAA after the deposition I gave
a couple weeks ago

642
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,590
wanted our computer they want to go to
return to calm and analyzing here's the

643
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:31,950
thing

644
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:35,950
they asked if I never exchanged email
with a young ass over there

645
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:39,450
I and I as i said yeah I think I I sent
in the peace

646
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:43,180
male few months ago and it was tasked to
be on my radio show

647
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,029
his detention he said you could make at
that time we China

648
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:51,020
time now is it alright and they asked
well do you have that he's a female

649
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:55,930
I got no I I raced after after the
communication was concluded I don't say

650
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:56,609
my mail

651
00:40:56,609 --> 00:40:59,930
nation while can you retrieve the erase
data

652
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:03,330
he said well you know this is in the
white house you can just get something

653
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,590
back like that it's

654
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:09,090
to what they're pretty unique system
it's really not that easy to do is

655
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:09,850
months ago

656
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:14,190
plus you know we also replace that dried
couple months earlier some you really

657
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,109
can't get they didn't

658
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:18,619
they wanted to go send an expert to or
to our place

659
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:22,760
in let us try and and look through our
hard drive

660
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,450
at deleted data in hopes of finding one
email message

661
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:30,840
from from last year alright and now keep
in mind this is something I feel very

662
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,680
strongly about

663
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,069
this is a system is used by dozens of
people re:

664
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:38,619
you know affiliates writers friends
whatever and

665
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:42,640
if you race if I'll is no indication who
that file belongs to

666
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,819
I was gonna have them go out there
looking through

667
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:49,400
files you know array Stata that

668
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,050
men mine at present his case for my
private email from the people

669
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:56,609
so that was something that I felt very
strongly about extremely strongly about

670
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:57,319
that you just

671
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,300
awakening allow this to happen scanty go
to jail over and

672
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:06,330
the judge wisely said is a multi-user
system no he can't do that

673
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:10,420
and ruled against them national there
was as recently as last week

674
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,790
I don't know the ruling is gone through
what happened and judging

675
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:17,420
my understanding at least said he said
if it's true what you're saying as a

676
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,740
multisystem then there

677
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,580
are these issues and so right now
actually were

678
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,920
in a dialog trying to satisfy

679
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,730
that arm satisfied their belief that

680
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:34,720
yeah it is indeed multi-user system and
that's where loss for the technological

681
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,650
barriers in

682
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:40,660
and things are means easy mode most
absurd at all familiar with computers

683
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,109
any UNIX operated to verify death

684
00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:49,450
poet I stay they want it they wanted to
send somebody out to our place to

685
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:52,869
actually go seeking excuses next to look
at the computer to verify

686
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:57,700
hit by sight a signal to use a machine
it

687
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,210
isn't it Israeli agent

688
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:06,270
I would like to know exactly what is at
stake for the other side

689
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,770
s I mean when you win the case how will
that change

690
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:14,660
the industry the computer and video
industry well you know that I can lose

691
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,230
their their precious copyright I am
right now

692
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,570
things are pretty much go the way
they've gone for them in the past

693
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:24,600
and i cant basically they just won't get
new control

694
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,420
technology they won't be able to dictate
how you view something

695
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:33,240
and when you can view it and what
platforms you can use things like that

696
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,369
but they'll continue to have a
stranglehold on the industry you know

697
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:40,710
as far as creativity music shuttle
mission things that they shouldn't

698
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:41,580
really be that upset

699
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:47,830
is someone mentioned

700
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:51,400
free speech before and and instigating

701
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,770
inciting the church by your actions I'll

702
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:58,080
and wanted to say that a

703
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,890
you know even though 52 the largest

704
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:05,470
100 worldwide economies

705
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:09,880
or corporations consider countries I
here in America

706
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,970
the power rests with the people and not
with the corporation's

707
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,840
even though corporations have been
artificially designated as people

708
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,300
they're not people and they don't have
the power to the people

709
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,400
and so excusing

710
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,890
remedies for

711
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:32,180
situations like this don't rest in
judicial made law

712
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:35,799
the arrest in the legislatures in the
state

713
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,900
and the federal interest and the
Congress and the Senate

714
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,570
and are our citizens us

715
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:45,810
as citizens boating and so

716
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:49,640
it's very important not to think liked
the corporation's

717
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,549
onus because they don't hours they would
like us to think

718
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:58,170
that they'll miss and that we have a
choice Coke or Pepsi

719
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,690
but we don't I mean we can choose not to
do any that

720
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:06,510
and also excusing call

721
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:11,090
I'll and also for gun exactly what i was
gonna say

722
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:15,330
I'll speech but a

723
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:20,330
oh hey look at that site I'll

724
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:24,650
the the important thing facing the CSS
is the access control issues

725
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:30,820
like you mentioned before and insight
about piracy it's all about copying

726
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:35,010
I'll ship to leave for LA for to say

727
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:39,120
I'll like to say that the corporation if

728
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,730
corporations you're right they don't own
people unless we let

729
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:46,890
that's right and a lot of people buy
into the crap that's cute out

730
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:51,230
an eight-day me forget the charity has
individuals member we just individuals

731
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:54,450
and if we can make these companies this
this corporations

732
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:58,150
this upset as just by exercising
individual rights

733
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,970
how we must be doing something right you
know it's that's what that's what

734
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:01,700
individuals

735
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,380
42 you know speak their minds for
information

736
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,609
and you can't let people squashed

737
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:11,890
thats it reminded me when I was gonna
say which was

738
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:16,060
that dole particularly I'll

739
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:19,720
I don't particularly like politics but
cases like this

740
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,090
bring the time its reverse engineering

741
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:26,300
secure computer security packing

742
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:30,820
finding out how technology works and
ultimately

743
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:36,030
like the principles behind science which
is to find out how the universe works

744
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,820
into question you can't talk about held
the next version

745
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:43,020
love you know that to secure

746
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:46,310
digital music initiative is gonna work
because

747
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,890
you know and now in maryland with the
UCI TA

748
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:54,350
you can talk about bad encryption can
even and

749
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:58,440
I'll just shut up but a we ought to show
pictures when it happened but

750
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,210
sorry enclosing with yes

751
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,540
