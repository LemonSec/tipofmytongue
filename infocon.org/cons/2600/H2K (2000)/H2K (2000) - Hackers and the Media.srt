1
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,360
okay my name is robert we modify my

2
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,470
senior editor with the net news Rock Me

3
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,570
with going to moderate the panel but
he's not here no

4
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,350
I over here on my left have never
radcliffe

5
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,940
who is a feature writer computer or

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,129
and on my right is domani

7
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,800
I who is this dreaming media columnist
at Boardwalk

8
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,390
I'll you know at this point we're pretty
much

9
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,170
going to open it up for questions I'm
sure Brain Academy

10
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,280
lambasted up here so if you wanna step
up to the plate

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,160
and be then now will answer any
questions than

12
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,830
I don't know fend off any criticism

13
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,830
your microphone out there for for your
help

14
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,869
ok

15
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,950
be alright and don't want to step up a
question

16
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,770
I am when we start by by giving from
biosphere your third

17
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,070
are yeah I guess been bacall

18
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,130
well I my name is that money I'm the
streaming media columnist for more watch

19
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,539
magazine I also write

20
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,540
I am features for board watch arm

21
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,240
one reason why i volunteered for this
opportunity of securing

22
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,370
arm is that I am I

23
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,030
write a column about Def Con I forward
watch

24
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,050
I am and I've been going to I very
attacker conventions

25
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,180
um kinda like riding the coattails of my
boss who all

26
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,810
remain nameless because some other
statute of limitations things I know

27
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,130
that I'm having expired yet

28
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,030
arm and I'm I figured I was some

29
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,670
best her through my two cents and work
on this panel because the fact that

30
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,260
I'm a little bit different I am in terms
of bomb

31
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,160
media on board what has traditionally
been an independent publication

32
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,220
has not been owned by the corporate
media as a

33
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,290
Talia supplicant challenge lol

34
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,780
I am at three

35
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,110
level of 5 o'clock very good I whereas I
guess my compadres I'm on the other side

36
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,370
of the table and then I

37
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,390
are basically on a more time critical
publication 0

38
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,810
a meaning that they have a turn around a
week to two weeks to get stories out I

39
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,250
guess

40
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,390
CNN is like probably an hour two hours
I'm on the website

41
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,120
I were watch it on time make it sound
like a relic at prayer time but

42
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,630
I am I got like I'm anywhere from 30 to
45 days had to write a story so I can be

43
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,250
a little bit more

44
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,840
there a little bit more in-depth I'll
sometimes a little bit more creative

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,930
I am in terms of covering things to give
me a little bit better perspective

46
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,720
arm that somebody like Procter Scott
like you know I am

47
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,370
on MSNBC on by Bill Gates I am now how

48
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,340
or unfamiliar folks appear shorter
deadlines I am but

49
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,530
watches the print publication they do do
a website but their website released

50
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,459
look at me for saying this but
meaningless unless he met things because

51
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,349
mister what they do is read print

52
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:52,230
a on website I'm articles that already
been

53
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,480
I am a print publication 10

54
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:02,480
me

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,360
who do you want them to a question

56
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,000
but again left to right right to left
how I 81st

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,720
okay there you go I all start with a
nightmare that just happened to me last

58
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,550
week

59
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,780
arm I filed happened a month column
which I do every month for Computerworld

60
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,740
on the dangers of using now stern ramp
for together I have

61
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,909
pretty reputable source but it wasn't
when I'm use before

62
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,960
and it turns out he left out some fine
details like you never did perform the

63
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,250
act like he said he did he only perform

64
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,580
are the hack which was a buffer overflow
on Napster to show them file

65
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,900
that it should be showing on so i got
really slammed by about one I did fact

66
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,870
checker to

67
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,530
sources one was the electronic a it the
secret service

68
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,310
faith that you PT at the electron crime
passports and the other with the army

69
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,120
computer investigation fenner on in
their laboratory

70
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,389
boatman said that yes they heard this
could be done and I still got slammed

71
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:21,310
on turns out when your back or 38 rap to
do anything that was not included in the

72
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,030
column

73
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,389
and I have to eat crow in a major
correction that's running on Monday

74
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:30,229
most of the time I go with sources I've
used before

75
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:35,180
on who have proven to be technically
adept and think what you do if your in

76
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,800
the industry long enough and I've been
doing this for six years he started yet

77
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,800
what I would call a cadre of technical
sources who

78
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,529
are reliable and whenever I'm doing
something that feels a little over my

79
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:47,370
head

80
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,250
I will send a paragraph or two of two
some fact checking bodies

81
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,699
on fans institute is becoming quite on

82
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:57,860
helpful with things like that I S the
square

83
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,569
is also helping me they will actually
send technical chunks

84
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,639
around onto up the bodies a

85
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,819
knowledge they have through their group
and there's a lotta website out there

86
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,669
now that are very helpful

87
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:14,229
down the administrators are and the
editors at those website

88
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:18,620
make very good sources on and there's a
lot of people who are buried in the

89
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,169
hacker community who only

90
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:24,310
give me their on handles who are also I
found very technically helpful

91
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,310
and that's how I do my fact-checking um

92
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,330
up because the question no I how do you
make your story accurate

93
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,919
a at the net news we have a much
different time frame is doug said he the

94
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,250
article about 30-45 days and that time
frame i down about 30 or 50 articles

95
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,729
so accuracy is something that it's

96
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:49,830
it's very very difficult and you need a
lot of work in order

97
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,440
you know to to get there I'll there's a
couple things that I do

98
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,649
a along those lines one is everything as
he sources

99
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:03,770
the my forces a little bit different
from hers I have a lot of people in the

100
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,020
in the security industry as well like
talking on a base with nice she said

101
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,049
a trusted source is one that we keep
going back to

102
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,560
when you get a new claim from someone
you

103
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,580
you don't you know and left its been re-

104
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,250
published out there somewhere and there
seems to be some

105
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,389
review do to you be very a

106
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:30,130
quick about it generally will will take
a lot much longer time to

107
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,029
cofactor something like that I've been a
lot a claim that new viruses that

108
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:37,599
like cover that we just dropped because

109
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,270
you know they haven't really panned out
up other than that

110
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,389
a the net we offer the water resources
internally as far as the computer lab

111
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:46,289
from people who

112
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:50,000
who know their stuff when we get the
last laugh February

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,210
there a lot of people I could talk to
about the

114
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,639
you know what happened like that with a
package come across the network

115
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,979
and get have a a breakdown what happened

116
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:04,419
so I get the the short answer that
question would be

117
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:08,149
you know how are we accurate well record
because we have forces

118
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:12,880
we've been in the business for a while
and and we tend to be able to

119
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,449
you know tell the BS from the a good
story aren't necessary

120
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:21,909
right for a and publication that

121
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:25,569
as a relatively leisurely pace compared
to you the other you up here

122
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:29,860
arm you know I've got a little bit more
time to talk with sources are I'm not as

123
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,188
time pressure for time-critical arm and
fortunately I've never been in a case

124
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:34,870
where I

125
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,390
arm mall today where I'll somebody's on
hair has really hot story for you that's

126
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,789
something nobody else has

127
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:46,089
arm more my piece is a ban something
where I've actually had time to sit down

128
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:48,420
and talk with the number sources a
number people

129
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,170
arm go to web sites

130
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,680
I'm go to some a player gonna some other
primary players involved as well some

131
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,589
people on background

132
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:00,680
I'm and talk to them and altogether
relatively complete story and I got a

133
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,170
chance

134
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,420
arm you know to go back and do a little
bit more digging

135
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,339
I think one of the things that the kinda
concerns me when I do you read about the

136
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,640
hacker community as I got this little
thing around my neck

137
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,160
and form a more subtle color Press Pass
and

138
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,040
I have to me kinda scratched my head and
Russia have a subprime

139
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,230
or should have the stuff back because
when I was adept on

140
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,559
I you know people to play mind games
with you and I

141
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,969
sometimes people try to play mind games
with you because you are the press

142
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,059
and some people try to play mind games
with you because some

143
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:35,400
they think you're not the press and I
just wonder became I'll

144
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,670
tell what

145
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,209
from the website itself and one other
thing and in that if you get a story

146
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:43,240
wrong

147
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,589
by your call very quickly and very
vehemently that

148
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:50,550
you get the story wrong and pretty soon
I mean

149
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,480
you know it's a great learning
experience if you get one thing wrong

150
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,709
you hear from all the readers out there

151
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:58,760
who are technically adept and you know
what they're talking about and I'll tell

152
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,680
you they got it wrong

153

Meckler being acquired by Penton media I

I'll to pander to the corporate interest

183
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,780
in terms that providers a that is being

184
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,810
or internally I by the publishers and
editors

185
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,910

187
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,850
I know that from were i right I am I
have had a different problem

188
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,570
I unlike the energy faxing over there
were watch is not my primary means of

189
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,250
support

190
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,690
I have a day job in another company and
sometimes I find

191
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,250
myself writing style are have written
stuff that

192
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,540
people within my company upset why why
the F are you writing about this thing

193
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,740
there are we we haven't find a captcha

194
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,950
go away but I'll

195
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,240
you know that if I think it's a rather
unique problem for us

196
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,400
right now um

197
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,470
I we find it interesting that you feel
lucky and the New York Times The

198
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,510
a Microsoft story on their site and it's
critical Microsoft and Yahoo Microsoft

199
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,350
ad running right down next to it

200
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,990
I in the net there's a couple things one
is

201
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,650
everyone think that were kinda like the
the big bad empire because

202
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:06,010
the deal with a strong the technical
publishing world for so long who are

203
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,330
actually kinda Road entity within the

204
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,640
the you know we're up smaller now since
the breakup

205
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,280
a you know the full of the the
publication and several other parts of

206
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,640
it

207
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,970
we actually I really do our own thing a
lot i mean a lot of stories to come from

208
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:20,440
the

209
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,570
the publication but the reporters inside
the

210
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,460
I we are not given any direction

211
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,110
the for relief any probation from
covering any stories I've never actually

212
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,020
been told

213
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,170
they can't cover story actually what
I've been threatened by a couple other

214
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,320
companies that

215
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,950
their be retribution for stories that I
written I just told them to go see my

216
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,140
editors and it never come back down to
me

217
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,490
so a at the united we've got a lot of
support

218
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,160
from our editors to cover the story that
we want to cover

219
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,329
I so it comes down more to a

220
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,180
who is getting the information to us a
after a little while

221
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,020
a being in the issue for and three are
you can start picking and choosing your

222
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,670
stories

223
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,640
but when a new report comes in sometimes
you need a lot of Management to

224
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,220
make sure the information that coming
into him and not have a PR line

225
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,000
and the end up covering are planting a
story towards the people who gave me the

226
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,760
information

227
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,580
Computerworld has a strong policy about
keeping benders out at the feature

228
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,000
stories for the most part

229
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,510
I built my own reputation as a
freelancer

230
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:30,010
I say your software magazine about two
and a half years ago and that was a

231
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,069
nightmare I care

232
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:36,180
to forget on there was a lot of that
going on in software magazine's there

233
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,500
were problems with

234
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,160
funny and I was specifically one cent as
a sacrificial lamb to go cover a

235
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,439
new remote control device i computer
associate

236
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,200
on I really resented that my termination

237
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,790
followed immediately after that
experience after I sent a long letter of

238
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,240
complaint to the publisher

239
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,350
I'm now I'm finding at the staff writer
that there's a lot more on pressure to

240
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,010
pay attention to vendors

241
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,230
and the vendors are the most nauseating
part that this whole

242
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,730
business and I literally just the night
before last from here fired off a letter

243
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,570
to my editor saying I'm not gonna talk
to vendors anymore and my

244
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,570
I need to for the stories I want to
write I've been there

245
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,450
for a month wealthy if they go for it
they don't I'll go back to freelancing

246
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,470
on these the news reporters

247
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,600
at Computerworld do you have to
regurgitate a lot I've been your

248
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,980
information and they have to do it on
deadline

249
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,440
on the schedule is horrendous eighty two
to three stories and we

250
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,960
classed up for the online section and
I'm just really glad I'm not want us

251
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,380
I'll perhaps they want anything I

252
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,470
some time said on the other side of the
fence in terms of media buying

253
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,780
and I knew that I

254
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,449
had certain publications drop it and if
I actually bought out space

255
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,090
we may see more in coverage there a

256
00:15:55,090 --> 00:16:00,020
home you know other people bomb at least
tell a lie quite truthfully that

257
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,780
I'll coverage shove bombs stories

258
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,610
is not directly linked you how much
advertising space that you buy

259
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,360
arm thing tend to like it to dinners at
the Palm another good restaurant

260
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,330
by now in other cases arm there is a

261
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,570
calls are dealing with killing like it
or not between the amount of advertising

262
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,420
that I is a vendor might do any amount
of

263
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,730
press coverage that I might get no it's
different from hackers because

264
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,850
arm you know nobody out here is really
buying

265
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,460
buying advertising and I Computerworld
or

266
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,490
CD or anything like that

267
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:42,490
around

268
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,790
contractor I'm going for the bigger
picture issues the things that affect my

269
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,019
readers the most

270
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:54,490
arm the paradigm for happening in
society as a result of the hands-on work

271
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,300
that they're doing with that thing by

272
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,600
a bit and that's why I cover the hacker
seen so much because

273
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,029
even tho you folks are perceived as
being on the fringe

274
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:08,510
you're also really working for some
social change in a specially this here

275
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:08,949
I'm

276
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:13,159
seen some chord coordination up effort
that looks more like political movement

277
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:15,069
to me than random hacking

278
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:19,438
and it's interesting to when I got
blasted for the Napster article every

279
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,250
single one and I'm not gonna 150 emails
and I'm not exaggerating

280
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,990
had a hacker handle and I thought that
was very interesting I forwarded that

281
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,370
will tidbit to my editors and said these
are our readers

282
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,919
so to five guys like manner

283
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,890
I know what I'm ready reading about this
weekend I'm not okay me first okay

284
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,309
I'll I you know it's it's kind of
interesting because

285
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:47,799
a the network I'm growing now tho

286
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:52,750
until for a long time we we had a short
reporters we definitely had a

287
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,399
par les reporters in their stories out
there so I was coming up early large be

288
00:17:56,399 --> 00:18:00,020
including consumer technology there's a
large difference between

289
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,158
be that for basically product oriented
like a

290
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:06,210
your computer technology would be about
game to be about

291
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,620
consumer software you have those
companies that would come right up to

292
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,919
you and tell you hey this week

293
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,149
this is what we're doing with great why
you cover this

294
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:17,590
and you'd basically you know turn on
your bf filter and try to pick the right

295
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,840
story about that

296
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,620
in the security industry known month and
you know they've been hacked no one

297
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,279
wants you to know whether or not

298
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:27,730
you know they've to suffered a doof
attack actually though

299
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,419
in February a couple company that but
firmly it was a great PR move

300
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:34,480
start telling you that you know that the
US attack I am

301
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,200
so a lot of it comes from interest in

302
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,220
in technology the I i'm actually

303
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,279
graduate electrical engineer I'll did
some research long time ago tho

304
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,720
a fairly technical I i'm still deeply
into that and a lot of what motivates me

305
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,470
as a writer

306
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,080
is a is you love technology a

307
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,710
though you know when the PC does what
they do a

308
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:03,580
you know the their a kinda performance
are

309
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,250
in the beginning is not what interests
me it's more the that the technical

310
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,100
aspects are the

311
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,070
well actually left in 10 percent
technical but the

312
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,039
you know be that as it may that you know
that pretty much what I'm looking for in

313
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:18,669
all this

314
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:22,520
and I talk to you know month several if
my talk to

315
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,260
a lot of people carrying through on a
regular basis though Bell

316
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,110
oh I every bike rack avatar

317
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,299
you know there's better places that fire
stories in that as well i mean the other

318
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:34,120
problem is that

319
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,000
while the night is the technical part a
we r

320
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,679
focused a lot on the general business
audience so

321
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,950
you know the the general about that are
out there

322
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,789
you know occasionally there are some big
ones but most of them kinda why beneath

323
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:49,620
our radar week

324
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,740
we handle them on other parts are fight
like the helper how to

325
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:58,750
I am well you know i I was a hearing
rumors about an orgy up here in

326
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,870
association with half

327
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:04,149
somebody tell me about that off the
record I'd really like to know now and

328
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:07,940
on I'm I bought a teacher I okay

329
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,440
good for that yeah I anyway see ours
Mike Hsu

330
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,649
on asking now anyways arm now I think
that I am

331
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:22,590
the arm I've been fortunate enough to be
able to pick the stories that I wanna

332
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,110
write

333
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:27,610
arm occasionally i've been I'm turn
things were obviously a

334
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:32,860
PR placard here shows come in and said I
i want your are so wonderful story about

335
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,250
Dell Intel Carolina

336
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,179
like yeah okay whatever I am and I've
been able to go I don't know sorry don't

337
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:39,039
have time this time

338
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,158
farm by

339
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,970
I you know i i think that

340
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,210
again mom word what has been rather
unique in the fact that I am

341
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,600
I'm we really know their the columnists

342
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,899
arm really to coordinate as much as this
should and sometimes we will have what's

343
00:20:57,899 --> 00:20:59,380
known as happy surfing deputy

344
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,159
arm in that I'll last year at Def Con

345
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:06,419
I was there and I covered the DOM one
pass for the story

346
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,789
TomTom Start I did a whole thing about a

347
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:15,120
back orifice and that scene

348
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,220
and then a my guess I forget who the
third writer was also did a different

349
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,379
spin on

350
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:25,020
a Def Con based upon what he saw

351
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,129
because he was more the security expert
I was and

352
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:31,659
sometimes we come out really good I am I

353
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:35,030
unfortunately I'm an environment where I
can pick story so if you've got a really

354
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,530
good story about something like a

355
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:42,820
carnivore come see well

356
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,620
out what operating system you have

357
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,639
operating system and also

358
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:51,670
a woody thinking flasher now

359
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,750
that's weird roll your own media a

360
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,730
I I don't know if you've never seen a
psycho back corrosion

361
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,020
gotta by her yes basically

362
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,160
readers actually pick that store shop
front page

363
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,680
think I think about that the whole that

364
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,150
and photograph by really quick um I'll
answer them kinda

365
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,340
reverse order first this laptop from a

366
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:21,490
phenomenon from the from the perspective
the net and I would imagine other

367
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,190
major Web sites out there is that

368
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,070
you have quite a a few your head coming
from print something that he read a

369
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,370
story at the bottom a lot of times will
be something cover talkback

370
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,230
talkback section and wheeler the reader
talkback

371
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,160
and it's interesting because about the
same thing that happened on flat thought

372
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,600
happened

373
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,030
there and that is the first three people
post about the story and everybody else

374
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,139
post about posters

375
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,710
so you're driving a lot of traffic a

376
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,910
it in one case I'll

377
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,130
I love you may remember a and a column
by

378
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,300
use the word loosely by John Patrick
that

379
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,380
kinda was very very critical the open
source movement

380
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,250
and he gets slammed on both flat and on
our site

381
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:12,080
and we work you a driving traffic to our
site by having a back on it then

382
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,149
you know that was not the case by on the
other hand

383
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:19,210
it works you get a lot of people there
they're just there for the discussion

384
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,620
if you you know whether your call if it
was good or bad

385
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,840
they tend to talk a lot about it so
community

386
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,389
paid posting the you know kinda

387
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:33,470
I'm in class start really isn't even
knew they don't they don't write news

388
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,100
but they just bring up a news story the
day and people talk about it

389
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,700
that sort of thing is going to drive a
lot of traffic and I think you'll see it

390
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,910
as part of every side

391
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,930
in the future from on the first question

392
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,060
a I used the

393
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,520
I was a Mac attic for a long long time a

394
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,080
K but unfortunately I was offering

395
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,129
games fanatic and the two didn't
necessarily go together

396
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:02,410
so about the three years ago I got my
first Windows box and

397
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,850
about two years ago I just switched over
to Lenox and

398
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:09,330
now my default mode and start-up start
up in the Linux

399
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:13,110
I bought a laptop and within three hours
ahead when a client fell

400
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:20,110
that's what I use 0 I use windows 98 I

401
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,770
bed very meekly in

402
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,950
why think

403
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:30,800
yeah I'm still running on ap us three
point three on the tree

404
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:37,800
notice I sky and now and now actually I
have to call in a closet here and please

405
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,200
be gentle but I'll

406
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,730
I am the use a that arm

407
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,890
Microsoft product which probably means
I'm screwed now

408
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,940
tomorrow iron now but I also but it's
funny because I also

409
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,260
arm try to remain allen's much as
possible although

410
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,379
shell prompt of the UNIX machine using
pine and

411
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,130
you may laugh and you may laugh but you
know I

412
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:05,690
nobody screwed me with any god damn I
love you virus a

413
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:10,000
there's something to be said for game
anarchist

414
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,990
and not anarchy archaic in terms of that
sort of thing because

415
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,060
all these new fangled viruses are
basically Tom

416
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,450
I R are targeted straight at Microsoft
in

417
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,240
I if you do things in a more archaic
fashioned and

418
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,210
you're less likely to get screwed I'll
Tom

419
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:36,210
me

420
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,830
well yeah I can agree with that I had a
good laugh a couple years ago when I was

421
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,429
on

422
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:52,630
when I was running a all allow both
computers and they all ran down

423
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,030
be an ass arm using TCP IP and happens
more

424
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:02,290
arm virus her now virus I'm his big warm
came out shutdown out the world except

425
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,310
for my call machine the universe numero

426
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:10,080
so that diversity is an

427
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,850
arms flashback question I want to slap
shot a little bit arm

428
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:17,390
and just you know roster and it's like
and its cool concept I'll

429
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,950
the and I can't really offer of an
abandoned I would like that one more

430
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,870
thing on plaster

431
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:26,390
is that actually go there every morning
and I take a look at the

432
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,520
you know what articles are talking about
and that's one of probably about twelve

433
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,160
fight to the ground in the morning to

434
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:37,660
to see whether or not there should be
aiming them covering that day but

435
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,360
hey buddy L bring it on

436
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,790
back you know him and I i have to ask
the question is anybody know we rock

437
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,629
mixes

438
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:49,940
I have to Amin if we have to post bail
for him and I got

439
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:55,680
for me he prolly that doesn't start till
3rd and he's probably posting is the

440
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,230
the story will he has all the
competition up here talking

441
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,840
its was a geared more toward you

442
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,060
um was there any bias in the writing in
c.net

443
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,750
during the distributed dowsers tax was
any pressure to be more

444
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,880
critic of them pleaded notice he read
the article they're a little more

445
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,910
critical

446
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:19,320
then when they talk about previous tax
and other companies

447
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,360
was earning like internal pressure to be
more critical

448
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,770
you know I didn't get any internal
pressure

449
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,139
I actually got a 88 closed-door briefing

450
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,180
on what happened exactly I had to be up

451
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,260
you know on background for all that I
mean I these companies like to talk

452
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,850
about what exactly happened at a

453
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,950
hard time tracking down anybody
including people internally

454
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:45,370
I am as you know I have never gotten any

455
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,680
pressure from anybody within our site

456
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,380
as far as a needing to to shut down a
story or two

457
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,010
plant in a certain way occasionally um

458
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:59,570
I tend to be kinda to attend to go on

459
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:03,629
after the underdog stories I'm I people
who like to let you know

460
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,820
the underdog technology not for anything
and

461
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,520
a few times when I taken a few potshots
at the majors

462
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,830
I am that shouldn't be

463
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,560
I mean you know every day you put now at
least in my case and putting out one or

464
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,429
two stories

465
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,930
and some time a you know for the pic

466
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,400
objectivity in the reporter side I
sometimes straight from that the editors

467
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,280
have rightfully brought me in line

468
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,899
but aside from that there hasn't been
any

469
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,080
censorship or anything like that on the
party a the net

470
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,720
next

471
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,200
I know the media get kinda beat up for

472
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,370
accused of changing the word hacker
sorta maligning in change in a way that

473
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:52,080
right has changed the work by Minister
the word liberal

474
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,990
into something that's just evil and mean
and nasty so I would like to know

475
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:01,259
him I would like to know what your
definition of the word hackers

476
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:04,929
and I for those of us who have been
covering this for a while we're

477
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:06,899
constantly using the word cracker

478
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:10,580
when something malicious ily are a legal
is Halfpenny

479
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,470
INR change the word cracker with
attacker when there's like the DDoS

480
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,779
attack to report

481
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:21,129
on my editors more times than I can tell
you have changed it back to the word

482
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:21,820
hacker

483
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,860
and as a freelancer I never got to see
my edited copy before it went

484
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,549
Press now I'm seen it coming back to me
and I have to carefully read everything

485
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:34,440
even though I thought I educated all of
my editors just in my last act in a

486
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,110
month became back to work cracker have
been changed for hackers again

487
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,519
so it a difficult task onto

488
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,649
keep everybody on the right definition
terms but this in the media

489
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:49,000
and when you've got new reporters coming
and it even worse

490
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,529
um actually

491
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:55,769
hate the term cracker I think it's
probably the

492
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:59,100
I mean I i've had this discussion

493
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,220
their news you put them on with with
several other member who security

494
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:02,830
industry

495
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,980
and we've had long discussions over this
because it always comes up once every

496
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,210
six months I'm someone writes an article
and

497
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,899
attacker and you get maybe you know 200
emails from people thing at the wrong

498
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:15,649
word

499
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:19,850
the wrong choice of words and for me

500
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:23,289
becomes down to my definition a Packers
someone who

501
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:27,610
a had kill that not only has killed but
what has a lot of curiosity

502
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:31,580
and going out with cracking open machine
I you're looking at the

503
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,730
the hardware or you know cracking open
software and looking at the software

504
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,879
a and it's more can carry up to the
drive them and trying to make a

505
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:40,470
statement

506
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,629
I I don't necessarily mean that activism
out there

507
00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:47,289
but I think that the your your
worldviews are completely

508
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:51,149
I irrelevant to whether or not you're
acker I

509
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:54,179
as far as but most the time I actually
when there's a

510
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:57,389
security incident or attack I will use
network attacker

511
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:02,399
the or I will start using the new final
words like cyber Randol

512
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,210
the nor script kid where appropriate the

513
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,610
but you know it fits it one of the
harder decisions and more choice than

514
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,369
the

515
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,600
you know that you have out there when
you when you're writing articles well I

516
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,029
think it's interesting because I

517
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:20,799
if I take the purest definition I have
to go to the Stanley the book that are

518
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:25,039
you know hacker someone who likes to
solve problems and in a technical sense

519
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:25,710
and

520
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:31,230
arm you know some times people use those
skills to solve problems for

521
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:35,299
role family benevolent purposes and
sometimes for relatively

522
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:38,690
relatively mellow one purposes arm and

523
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:42,119
I think that takes us down to a second
level where arm

524
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:45,179
where there is more ethics and more
thinking going on with any

525
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:48,830
hacker community but that def con in
here in other places where is

526
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:53,340
you know what level you know how do you
define what a criminalist

527
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,690
I mean for example arm forget

528
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:00,029
not kevin Mitnick but the other guy all
whole time

529
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:04,190
yeah okay Paulson goes arm takes control
Ave

530
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,470
pounds which grabbed all telephone lines
to

531
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,940
a Tom radio station I

532
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,059
and make some cell caller number 120 and
all warranties

533
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:17,639
can't do that quite easily and when to
Ferrari now

534
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:22,799
it's a very poor hack okay but at the
same time there's a certain amount have

535
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,330
you know is that was what is the action
that he did criminal and

536
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,590
the answers while taking over the the
phones which probably wasn't a legal

537
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,369
thing you know

538
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:34,570
arm and the reason why bring back this
issue

539
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:38,970
criminals and I know that folks like
down at 2600 I'm have tried to make

540
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:44,340
arm I'm neck and other folks to

541
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,679
poster child for ARM I am

542
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,049
a civil rights and first amendment
rights but what's night you know it's

543
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:52,668
not BS

544
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:56,240
fact that at some point in time these
folks did break los

545
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,909
and and you know that trying to

546
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:04,470
ignore that within the definition arm
you know what you wanna call hacker

547
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:08,010
you know you know you have to call
criminal criminal sometimes too

548
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:12,019
on the other side a point we're starting
to see a lot of Dom avenues

549
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:15,240
the word hacker I'm by both the record
industry

550
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,720
and by the motion picture industry who
wants to call anybody who uses an mp3

551
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,010
for anybody who wants to use DVD
decoding technology

552
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,730
the criminals they want to say
everybody's a hacker everybody's an

553
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,789
illegal criminal and our whole shirt
tail

554
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:32,809
heir-apparent cell are you know their
pirate they're up to do piracy and

555
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:36,760
and that's a reason why were to have a
lawsuit on Mondays as that's not because

556
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,440
up

557
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,869
the fact that this or hidden nom de Mar
ground you know

558
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:44,809
is a hacker in the purest sense the word
but it is a criminal I don't think cell

559
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:48,220
but in a motion picture association
would like to take that word hacker

560
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:53,049
and and as follows: are Maria with the
Napster and say okay everybody who does

561
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:57,440
things not according to the corporate
way is a criminal i think thats

562
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,820
wrong to so I they're still gonna
there's gonna be a lot

563
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,000
i'd I mean the battle over what hacker
means arm

564
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,869
is still being defined and as to who
actually owns that term and the shadings

565
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:09,919
on that term

566
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,098
I'm already fighting about that for a
number of years

567
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:19,230
and hopefully won't get hopefully the
community that owns that definition

568
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:23,060
will be able to define that not the
corporations such as rhea

569
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,259
and MPAA arm you know

570
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:31,260
will try and next that definition update
to be seen that way

571
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,520
a big part of why can't we live in
people have known that her missing in

572
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,389
this room

573
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:40,730
diarrhea I you know I remember stories
about how many for Wired News

574
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:45,250
and my editor change term hacker in
every instance to the work cracker

575
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,750
and he did that a long conversation a
number of phone calls

576
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,329
and and in his exchanges because I think
people

577
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:55,760
had written email thing thank you for
using the word cracker and

578
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,299
better you can happen when you talk
about the the scare you know on an old

579
00:34:59,299 --> 00:34:59,690
school

580
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,930
act or I what am I can think he's not at
all these wonderful thing

581
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:07,839
their disparaging my name now 16l he got

582
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,420
and I'm sure you know after I talk to
people I

583
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,990
a number of people wrote back and youth
you know some sort of screwed up

584
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,880
have to really speak to say you now a

585
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,880
you're doing it all wrong but you know I
you don't know you're talking about and

586
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,089
of course beginning nor

587
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:27,560
I think that hackers respond to those
kind of stories

588
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,900
as readers at and family at hard at that

589
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,030
network you talk about 850 you know
email

590
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:37,680
you said that he rather that they can to
listen because that's the readership

591
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,828
I and I think that bad a is the way

592
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:43,869
has had changes demanded that had been
plus happen

593
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:47,900
I the other question I want to ask you
can view is

594
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,950
sense there's a lot of concern voiced by
hackers

595
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:55,098
about into the happen media I I think
wanna the answers

596
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:58,520
it happened one ball in the recording
process

597
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,069
fourth thought I wanna eat you can talk
about what makes a good

598
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:05,299
source what makes you happy somebody
would rely on

599
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:08,880
I the hell yeah I know a lot of that I
want to educate

600
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,880
the Prophet get media but often hires
mike thanks

601
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,520
then some hockey for two hours and
there's not a quote you can use

602
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,250
I what what makes a good source I what
something that

603
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,480
you would like tell the audience happens
that are here

604
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,569
if they have something to ask how did
they get that information Kia

605
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:32,890
on the first thing is is that you know
stop bragging and stop in mindless

606
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:37,549
a hey I can do this I can do that and
let us know what the relevance is to our

607
00:36:37,549 --> 00:36:38,720
readers

608
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,890
on I try to talk about things that are
really gonna

609
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,618
fact my readers in their ability to do
their jobs

610
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:49,140
and if you can bring into that context
it's a lot easier

611
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:54,049
also the technical jargon can be
minimized a bit

612
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:57,670
so that the a the haxor the exploit

613
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:02,040
or the a security but or the weakness in
the software

614
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,579
can be explained in terms but we can see
what the end result is

615
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:11,500
have that bug for that weakness in the
software and data I just found this an

616
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:11,990
idea

617
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:15,790
this what the end result you know are is
it's a widespread

618
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:19,380
spread problem for my readers is this
something people are going to take

619
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,740
advantage up

620
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,299
is this just a minuscule little thing
that I really don't need to bother with

621
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:25,339
at this moment

622
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:29,609
on is it a one-two punch you have other
elements that could be combined to make

623
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:31,109
this a completely

624
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:34,640
big problem on for my readers and

625
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,129
is your information reliable on you have
someone else I can talk to to verify

626
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:39,799
this

627
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:44,720
have you tried this on how do you want
me to handle your identity

628
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,900
if it's something that could get you in
trouble at work you need to state that

629
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:52,270
right up front so that we can make sure
we protect US sources as well

630
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,690
those are pretty much the things I look
for

631
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,040
I'm um the first manned up I look for
integrity

632
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,700
I mean you're not I think the fourth if
you get burned by force once you're

633
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,990
never going to be going back to them
ever again

634
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:09,200
I am you know it is it's definitely were
not infallible appear so

635
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,869
and a sure you all know that I but

636
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:17,599
you know it's hard sources go you have
to develop on you talk with him a lot

637
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,990
in you try to get a measure up who they
are how far their technical expertise

638
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,510
goes

639
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:26,529
other a lot of people who claim to be a
lot more technical than they are

640
00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:30,369
and you have to be able to kinda weed
them out and make sure

641
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:34,200
the you know you that your sources are
feeding you a line

642
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,080
and is also I mean for myself I don't
know what the others up here but

643
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,240
kinda put sources into a lot different
categories there's a few that I I keep

644
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,330
on the background all this talk to

645
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:48,119
and to try to found out stories other
people I trust the most from the people

646
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,790
that I wouldn't want to

647
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,420
you know if you need to get a quote I'm
sure I can get a quote from about a

648
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,700
hundred different people

649
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,630
but when I really need understand the
story understand the technology behind

650
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,310
during with being used

651
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,970
and you want someone that you can
definitely traffic we know understand

652
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:06,140
the material to go to

653
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,140
I good sources arm I'd have to say
there's a problem like

654
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,598
3 different aspects I'll number one is
the ability

655
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,240
no forgive me but to communicate in in
in the English language

656
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,310
on at least and such a fashion that I
can understand

657
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,230
you know because I ago if you can
explain it to me an early me what has

658
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,210
gone on

659
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:28,859
and I can relate that to my my readers
and

660
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:33,790
the more obscure you are the more
problems I will have in translation

661
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,230
arm I think secondly I am

662
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:41,470
you got I'm experiencing some unique
information I am

663
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,270
don't kid yourselves on there a lot of
people with a lot of different stories

664
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,220
out there

665
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,279
number if you've got a unique spin on it
work it's something that I haven't heard

666
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:49,609
from somewhere else

667
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:53,020
yeah okay maybe I'm gonna give you you
know the time today verses

668
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,670
arm first tiny I whatever I'm

669
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:01,089
move on to the next %ah hard my rolodex

670
00:40:01,089 --> 00:40:04,640
producers repeated that she wants now I
we have an interesting special guest

671
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,440
which is

672
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,380
social engineer her way up here I'll let
you introduce yourself

673
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,730
I guess she's the rock make substitute

674
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:17,580
he'll but elaine is big enough for two
other

675
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:22,259
or a personal country which is the tech
magazine persian 100 Caribbean

676
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,849
I I have a monthly security code on and

677
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:29,970
every other month all here a Linux
comment is OK

678
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,099
please get month and its bill online and
print

679
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:36,510
free I signed paneling

680
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:40,410
two days ago I just realized is going on
now so that's why I'm

681
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:45,368
Lee I come from the background were I
have a degree in computer science and I

682
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:48,569
came from technical background then a
started braiding

683
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:53,440
about it because I used to work for
network security for the Caribbean and

684
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,750
there I met some people who are looking
for writers and

685
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:00,130
especially that technical stuff cuz
allot other

686
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,470
their business people were being
assigned to write tech articles and then

687
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:08,270
they didn't really understand that just
about what's going on whom they could

688
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,119
some write something or generalized
something in a way that they thought

689
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,160
would make

690
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,299
the issue clear to people that instead
which is computed

691
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:19,589
matter in all their community should be
up in arms saying

692
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:23,109
say this is completely wrong so for me

693
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:29,569
sources it certainly is is the people I
know people i cn but track

694
00:41:29,569 --> 00:41:33,049
general hacker be

695
00:41:33,049 --> 00:41:37,589
that needed asking for it

696
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:41,890
explains to media thing

697
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:48,890
any other questions about their bring
along

698
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,980
facing sites

699
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:08,980
you

700
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:16,839
like this

701
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:37,009
and say on yep definitely its its the
easiest thing for somebody to grass

702
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:40,220
to understand not technically can see
their website thinking

703
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,380
think that is disasters even out your
skin a pretty good

704
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,070
corporation and you try and explain to
them that they need security in the same

705
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:50,390
lying with the worst case scenario think
that your payroll

706
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:54,049
information doing but doesn't really
seem to hit them easy

707
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,270
your front page will be changed
something in the only like breasts

708
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:57,730
they're

709
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:01,030
that you big deal it's the only thing
that really understand

710
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:04,190
now the rest through the orgy this
evening where the hell have I never is

711
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,690
but she says it's a sin

712
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:08,900
um yeah a couple things on that one is

713
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:13,120
if you go and look at attrition I and
last november there's about

714
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,290
felt like over 50 a web defacement in
one day

715
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:19,970
I you know there's a lot we get a lot of
web the basement out there

716
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:23,240
but if you look at what the coverage is
up the defacement

717
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,110
them not actually all that much coverage
out there percentage-wise

718
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:31,940
I a different aspect from that when you
see someone like maybe get hacked

719
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,260
are the get DNF

720
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,370
the math greater or whatever you want to

721
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:41,730
the call that particular attack I is it

722
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:45,650
these are things that can really affect
the corporate image and today

723
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,740
more than at any other time in our
history a corporate image has a big

724
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,580
dollar value

725
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,750
so the the TAC can can really be
important for business ventures out

726
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:55,150
there

727
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:58,380
them I usually only use

728
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:02,950
a references and statistics you know how
many website got hacked last year

729
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:06,480
I never to mean anything about
protecting your webster

730
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,360
I'm but for the most part web hacks are
like graffiti

731
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,010
to us now arm it's almost the same
viruses really you've got

732
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:18,520
every vendor in the world who makes five
protection comes up with a new virus

733
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,340
every day and I think we should cover it
in our happened a month

734
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:25,380
column or whatever and people are
starting to sleep on the viruses and

735
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,530
Western asleep on

736
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,980
on that website hacks really we're
looking for stuff that

737
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:33,020
more widespread more arm

738
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,990
damaging to the systems themselves well

739
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:41,210
by a thank you it was rather amusing as
adept con last year in the present a con

740
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:44,680
their site was hacked arm you know it's
kinda like

741
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:49,950
wanted to Andrea Skyrim's I'll either
that or somebody at NSA wanted revenge

742
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:53,300
I'll but seriously folks I mean the

743
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,010
the you know I people are starting to
wise up about security

744
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:01,020
and you know you have this big rack
coverage people get lies about security

745
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,890
and they tightened down the Baltimore
area and they become vulnerable in

746
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:05,850
another area that they haven't looked at
us

747
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:10,020
that's that's evolution now if that
person was what I tax now at Iris's

748
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:13,350
all you know

749
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,720
next year it'll be something else
uelmen's

750
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,930
people finally get real online now

751
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:23,669
you know how to be more secure by what
space and miss the guys who were

752
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:27,360
running the sides and got attacked just
can have their act together security

753
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:27,880
wise

754
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,040
and I'm I don't want to say well the
deserved yet

755
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,270
by on the other hand arm you know

756
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:37,420
better that they get hacked by somebody
now

757
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,109
and lock their doors run in

758
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:44,019
later where something worthwhile because
I have time for one or two more

759
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:44,650
questions

760
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:51,350
did

761
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:54,130
I'm where but

762
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,260
I'd like to know that to I young

763
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,720
their

764
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,740
yet there's a big problem in the vid I
mean people rethinking the median they

765
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,300
think they're true and and the biggest I

766
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,160
there you go all arm

767
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,259
you know what are the biggest problems
out there is is the numbers problem

768
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,180
especially the security industry because

769
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,500
a in up how you will let me let me
explain to personnel tell you

770
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,990
what will probably solve this problem
later on I mean you look at the moment

771
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,780
the virus the

772
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,270
you have people and Korea claiming that
the you know

773
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:35,410
350,000 computers were hit a

774
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:38,660
turkey with 250,000 I mean yeah I
remember the word

775
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,500
completely off the cuff from government
agency the probably didn't know any

776
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,000
better

777
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,050
and now they have become back because

778
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,730
a in you know I'll I prolly think maybe
ten percent

779
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,420
at the most a that number go ahead a

780
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,600
you know I'm doing and doing some
research for

781
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,840
possible book that I'm doing it's it's
been very hard to pin down any really

782
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,540
significant numbers out there

783
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:06,000
what i think is going to solve this
problem is insurance agencies I

784
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,460
surprisingly these people like to do
accounting and when suddenly you're

785
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,430
claiming

786
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:15,540
that that you know kevin Mitnick to pack
my computer then

787
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,300
my fourth good were is worth eighty
million dollars yet to actually go to

788
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:19,930
the insurance

789
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:23,460
agent and say why it's worth eighty
million dollars and they don't want to

790
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,190
pay you that

791
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:28,550
so for me come too much more realistic
figure and I think that wall

792
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:31,720
almost the problems out there know
whether or not the media will actually

793
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,360
be able to get access to the few the
whole different matter but

794
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,680
anybody else well author and my two sons
were

795
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,750
the down the problem is that a reporter
or who I don't at this the two and three

796
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:45,680
other people sitting here but no call a
big group quantities industry analyst

797
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,279
group

798
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,850
to basically poll numbers are there
we're frankly

799
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:53,430
arming you know it anybody I don't want
to say

800
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:56,839
you know but yet their people like
Forster Gartner

801
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,110
other folks that you know because they
are an analyst group in people

802
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:04,810
and corporations are a lot of money at
them they generate these numbers that

803
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:08,430
have no basis in reality and those
numbers get quoted I know because I had

804
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:11,200
to run down some others numbers and and
some the stories are running away

805
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,110
where the hell you at this number from
and they're like well personal life

806
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:15,490
experience through the ball

807
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:18,570
and Paul you know

808
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:21,940
for shit like arm you know amount
penetration

809
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,820
you know at our farm

810
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:30,090
you know the cash was larry o'rourke
hoping the other Mon

811
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:34,600
arm that's not desktop PCs arm

812
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:39,140
thank you n see the ANC's to come you
know X terms it's still haven't come to

813
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:39,560
life

814
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,640
arm you know at you know network
computers were supposed to be prolific

815
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,540
in the home by now there should be like
to $2.4 million of them out there and

816
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,370
they're like maybe

817
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:52,240
you know 224 out there and but I had
some guy back two years ago was climbing

818
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,190
is going to happen million other things
out there by nineteen

819
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:58,840
I you know 98 99 and his number

820
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,930
you know it is just didn't take office
the it's just heinous

821
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:06,500
I mean if you really wanna training
experience I want these analysts and get

822
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,770
him to talk you through

823
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:11,900
how he arrived on his numbers and you
know it it does involve a chicken

824
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,140
entrails but I think they get out more
accurate answers a venir

825
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,620
there's a couple sources I go to

826
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:22,600
numbers everybody already knows that I
think are slightly more on the up and up

827
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,050
and wanna

828
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:28,000
the CSI FBI survey because the interview
500-plus organizations to find out what

829
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,110
their losses for

830
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:32,660
in terms of perceived dollar value in
terms of number of packs if they

831
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,129
discovered into their systems yada yada
yada

832
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:39,460
on but those numbers are are so
regurgitated out there in the industry

833
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:43,040
you know Athens have some numbers that
the American Society for Industrial

834
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,880
Security again they do

835
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,230
on bona fide surveys I mean it into

836
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:51,640
yeah I mean according to some others
people out here we should be so

837
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,080
recovering from y2k

838
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,330
I am you now can hear all that portion
now

839
00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:00,640
sorry only stuff that we you know its
it's just ridiculous somehow somebody

840
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,250
things are

841
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:05,890
manufactured so they can sour or one
possible explanation I got was

842
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:10,080
is coming a shit with your reputation
were its public

843
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,509
how'd you recoup that it was data that
was

844
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,590
secret like the network computer against
before

845
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:20,100
all the six companies got into their Big
Ten team

846
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,550
by Microsoft Game public with the idea
where

847
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:28,030
will what's the Petworth and thought
that thing temple part but I've been

848
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:29,350
told that members see it

849
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:32,819
how much are you paying your email
administrators how much

850
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:37,340
are your if you've seen software worth
it here to reinstall or upgrade

851
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:42,000
how much downturn did you get and how
much money can you

852
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,710
in making machines weren't running and a
lot of probably

853
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:49,520
you incredibly inflated you have your
best business day of the year

854
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,390
just happened to have been amended was
it and that's the number that they can

855
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:54,440
use just

856
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:00,250
a current I will take one more question
trial

857
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:06,100
it's a blow board I

858
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:13,100
try to make it do maybe you'll

859
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:20,160
moved

860
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,630
um I would like to offer two
observations there

861
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:28,170
and that even normal in a few the right
now that I think

862
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:32,520
the best operating system that I theme
from a technical perspective the p.o.s

863
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,120
armament but unfortunately it got run
over by an ex

864
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,940
and I think the same thing is is
happening somewhat with the

865
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,290
would be FB except for the fact that it
is

866
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:47,080
compatible with the next and so it
probably has a big chance of surviving

867
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,020
also

868
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,640
the fact that it kinda looked up to as
the the

869
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:56,319
perfect version love you next for her
the any individual user out there

870
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,850
all the journalistic community the whole
by the way

871
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:05,069
we're really going to get up there we
really we're really getting on top a bit

872
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:05,780
beyond

873
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:10,330
open source movement and we're really
seeing that it is

874
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:13,420
a movement my editors just don't think
that

875
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:17,090
BST is hot see people going to link
group in and they see people wearing

876
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,870
penguins and the girl you're paying with
it

877
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:22,740
cue who built a cover people understand
that close people and pick your little

878
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,640
devil

879
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,490
just I too much trouble for exhibited

880
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:30,870
so you can get in trouble farm rednecks
and access

881
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:34,210
called pick your right math guy

882
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:38,170
yeah hello and it's getting it's warm
and fuzzy I was once used upon a time

883
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,290
for a bulletin board called

884
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:43,529
opus mmm but arm

885
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:46,710
and adults get my comment on that one
day I would have to like come off the

886
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:47,770
wagon and trying

887
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:52,560
to cry UNIX for for like daily use it
but America

888
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:57,029
you all seem like a you guys are the
good journalists where the bad

889
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:01,180
journalists and and computer all

890
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,450
cure-all technologically savvy and have
to go on smart

891
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:08,150
and that can tell you're all thinking
when you're speaking with all of us

892
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:12,320
and so what what are you guys doing to
educate your peers

893
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:17,250
about the perceived I not even perceive
but the actual

894
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:21,580
abuses I'll talking about computer
hacking talking about technology

895
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:24,880
in in Media & journalism I'll

896
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,230
especially with regards to corporate
ownership in the media

897
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:31,760
all-star I just got hired on a computer
world and I was surprised to find that

898
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,180
everybody there with commenting on my
articles and how much they learn from

899
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:35,950
them

900
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:40,590
and on I think that you know if you can
report correctly

901
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:44,420
you can be accurate you can be clear and
if you're picking a subject that

902
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,820
difficult like with this is on and you
do it right

903
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:54,810
the articles themselves become an
education to other writers

904
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:58,040
I'm you know I it bad journalists well

905
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,779
it all the time but your focus really I
mean if you look at the mainstream media

906
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,650
partner for the bad journalist it's just
that they have to rate for a certain

907
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:05,740
audience

908
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,800
and in writing for that audience I'm a
lot of time to you

909
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,850
you simplify things down to a level
until they're wrong

910
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:15,230
a lot of time your editors get all the
vet and they think that

911
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:18,430
they can pray that another way and it
perfectly correct and when in fact they

912
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:20,870
do it make the completely ridiculous

913
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:24,390
I so there's a there's a lot of
different reasons I mean

914
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:27,690
I've written article the made out there
that

915
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:31,400
in the end might not have been my best
work

916
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,640
I for a lot of different reasons i mean
tho a bit where the those two reasons

917
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,029
other is just the deadline pressure

918
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:40,290
so you know in some ways I you know I
can be about your health as well i mean

919
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:43,110
a lot he may I get a lot of emails every
day to tell me fell

920
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:46,610
so it comes down to that I think there
are

921
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:50,020
definitely the most technical people out
there I would hope that anybody even

922
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,690
threw himself a journalist is interested
in learning

923
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:57,180
and doing so that the the conventionally
handle whatever be terrifying to

924
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,860
I say one more thing when he was talking
about other journalists and deadline

925
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:04,510
I used to work for the Mercury News and
everyday

926
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:08,440
I had a different subject every day I
had to become an

927
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,500
instant expert on something and
technology is tricky and if you're

928
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,070
talking to mainstream news like CNN

929
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:18,650
or the San Jose Mercury News and The New
York Times this may be the one and only

930
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,420
technical story that right right

931
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,650
ever and so on by making things

932
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:28,640
in plain English so they can understand
it yet understand basketball tonight

933
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,330
on their editors don't know what their
editing on the mainstream media you're

934
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:36,170
gonna find a lot more problems with
accuracy out there as opposed to protect

935
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:36,630
up

936
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:41,550
industry it and then with an
oversimplification just be the biggest

937
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:44,260
problem try to make it easier to
understand than making it wrong not

938
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:45,700
understanding that some other stuff

939
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:49,820
just can't be easily explained it is
complicated

940
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:52,850
unfortunately I work for a magazine that
actually buy

941
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:56,720
have changed read every month I become
more educated more technically educated

942
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,840
ironing board watch and I'm I'll freely
admit that

943
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,780
arm the is is much as I'd like to think
that I'm

944
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,020
action terms and 1 I'm writing about

945
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,890
arm streaming media you're writing about
the hacker industry I I know there's at

946
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:11,900
least three other

947
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,530
writers there who are off the top of my
head that are better than I do and and

948
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,880
have a more in-depth knowledge than I do
you sell

949
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,130
on now be careful and humble the same
time

950
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:25,040
and all while brock meeks and he really
does worships Satan he is indeed now it

951
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,040
is indeed a good writer

952
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,779
now just kidding about the scene partner

953
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:36,780
