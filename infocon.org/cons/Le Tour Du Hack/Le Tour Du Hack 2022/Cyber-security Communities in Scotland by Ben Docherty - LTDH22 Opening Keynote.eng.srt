00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,479
excellent

9
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,159
so yeah uh

10
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,240
come down and do the stuff on his behalf

11
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,479
so uh i'm gonna change it up a little

12
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,600
bit i

13
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,360
my main experience is northeast of

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,159
england so i will let's say some

15
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,000
security community in scotland and the

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,840
northeast i'll expand it a little bit

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,439
just make a little bit easier but they

18
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,960
are very kind of similar community

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,320
similar size scotland's just a little

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
bit further ahead of us a few years

21
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,840
ahead of us to be honest

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,600
uh so

23
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,240
what am i here to talk to you about well

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,520
freddie give me

25
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,000
this three things i wish i'd known 20

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,479
years ago

27
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,759
three things i wish i'd known 20 years

28
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,719
ago

29
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,200
i can't quite say 20 years ago i can get

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,399
close to that uh but not quite uh so

31
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,000
i've got for these two answers and i'm

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,720
gonna

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,920
kind of throw a bit of my uh

34
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,480
random making up as i'm making up as i'm

35
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,720
going along and war stories and whatnot

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,360
uh so the question

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,239
what

38
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,160
three things don't wish i'd known 20

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,319
years ago well i'll start off with a

40
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,560
little bit about qc

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,360
so

42
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,560
about 20 years ago feddy was talking to

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,599
his brothers

44
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,840
and saying well look this cyber security

45
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,599
is something i want to do something with

46
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,840
it at that time the brothers were

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,599
it didn't there's nothing there it

48
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,760
doesn't exist at that point it didn't

49
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,560
uh realizing that

50
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,480
there are things that change

51
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,440
uh from that is he's now running corn

52
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,000
cyber so one of uh well

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,599
one of the fastest growing companies in

54
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,879
the uk

55
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,200
uh i know personally we have what triple

56
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
quadrupled in size in the last month and

57
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,680
customer base

58
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,720
so it's how did he get there from that

59
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,319
there's a few things that if you'd known

60
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,480
a bit further ago he would have uh

61
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,280
would maybe do it a bit quicker so what

62
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,360
what do you learn across that so

63
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,560
you're always guaranteed to be

64
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,760
successful

65
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,159
in cyber security it's

66
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,519
it's pretty much an industry that

67
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,599
everyone's begging for if you've got the

68
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,040
push if you've got the drive if you'll

69
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,560
do the

70
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,920
little bit more digging if you'll be the

71
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,360
kind of person that knows i'll spend a

72
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,680
little bit of time looking at uh ctf so

73
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,360
i spend a lot of time looking and

74
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,840
researching to send them before i go for

75
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,200
a roll through or whatever if you spend

76
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,159
that time

77
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,799
if you're that kind of person that

78
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,640
if you see the challenge you want to get

79
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,080
in you see locked door you want to open

80
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
it just because of it then you will be

81
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,680
successful in cyber security it's just

82
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,080
down to yourself it's a massive industry

83
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,439
and it's growing

84
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,000
exponentially everyone needs cyber

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
uh what else has he got done uh oh whoa

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,040
nice one

87
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,959
one thing that he wants you to know

88
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,799
the overwhelming pressure

89
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,519
cyber security is one hell of a high

90
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,760
pressure job a lot of people think oh

91
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,720
yeah around the computer

92
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,809
[Music]

93
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,199
when you're sitting in those meetings

94
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,520
where you're like right

95
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,560
this is

96
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,960
potentially a great situation this is

97
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,639
where we're trying to work out what's uh

98
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,240
incident response are going you've got

99
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,639
the whole uh war room runner

100
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,479
and you see the faces of the people

101
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,520
you're working with people that you're

102
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
trying to resolve the issues for they

103
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,880
are scared

104
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,400
and you have to be there you have to be

105
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,080
one of those we've seen this before

106
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,160
we've done this before we know how to do

107
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,800
it

108
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,040
we can bring our experience bring all of

109
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,720
the things we've learned and we can make

110
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,919
your life a little bit easier and

111
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,199
for me that's

112
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,960
that's kind of the big pull for cyber

113
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,080
security

114
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,680
making people's lives a little bit

115
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,720
easier sorry i know i'm getting off

116
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,039
track from fetish one but uh that that's

117
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,720
kind of what i what i like about the

118
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
social security industry

119
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,880
and especially in scotland if companies

120
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,240
work together if companies share

121
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
intelligence if companies aren't the

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,680
kind of companies which they desire all

123
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,039
the things that that doesn't want to

124
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:15,919
open up

125
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,520
everyone as a whole

126
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,960
you can

127
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,600
everyone can actually make a difference

128
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,320
in cyber security if i was to chase

129
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,520
that's picked up by something else

130
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,680
another company i wouldn't think oh

131
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,199
they've stole my ip they're working on

132
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,720
that not so secure it's one of the few

133
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,720
industries where people like great let's

134
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,880
share let's get better together let's

135
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,680
all

136
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,199
kind of add to it enhance everything

137
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,440
together so yeah i don't know

138
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,120
it's nothing much i don't know what fed

139
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,039
he's talking what fenny's kind of points

140
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,120
were but there's one other thing that's

141
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,160
kind of

142
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,400
the major point about cyber security and

143
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,039
it's uh it's a thing where i think the

144
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,120
the industry is kind of a bit unique

145
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
and you don't

146
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,000
it's it's that that community side

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,520
a lot of other industries you don't find

148
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,680
people going out of their way to run

149
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,120
conferences

150
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,880
to put on community events to document

151
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,520
what they find to write the blog that

152
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,080
tells you how this cool that last year

153
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,319
works or even if it's simple stuff like

154
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,919
going over what other people have done

155
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:14,800
and

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,400
interpreting things in different ways

157
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,919
you really have the breakthrough

158
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,400
community i mean there's uh

159
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,560
glorious lines in this presentation

160
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,000
community people such as the above

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
uh there's it's

162
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,199
we don't care about one company you're

163
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,080
from we don't care about what

164
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,919
what the background is where wherever

165
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,520
you're from we care about what you bring

166
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,120
to the community what you want to

167
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,800
show what you want to give what you want

168
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,240
to kind of

169
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,400
contribute towards making everyone's

170
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,120
lives better because if we are that

171
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,919
annoying deep cyborg what what kind of

172
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,000
our team structure was 20 years ago what

173
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,360
our team was where everyone knew their

174
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,120
own thing you didn't tell anyone then

175
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,479
you end up in the same problem that

176
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,000
we're in today where people haven't been

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,199
sharing people haven't been having

178
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,440
problems we have the infrastructure

179
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,120
really

180
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,800
if i.t

181
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,160
and that side of things have been

182
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,639
planned and structured in the right way

183
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,960
you shouldn't have impulsive we only

184
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,639
exist because there's boats there's

185
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,039
issues there's worries with things and

186
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,759
people like to prod

187
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,400
it

188
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,080
really exists because of the innate

189
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,319
human nature of curiosity

190
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,080
and the fact that things

191
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,560
sometimes aren't skewed right but yeah

192
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,080
sorry i'm getting very ranty on this

193
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,720
but yeah the the main point that uh

194
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,400
that i kind of want to make for the

195
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,639
keynote is yeah it's it's all about

196
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,800
community

197
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,039
if you have any difficulties if you have

198
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,800

199
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,120

it's great to see and that's

207
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,520
that's kind of the unique thing they're

208
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,919
not unique but the fairly unique thing

209
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,599
about uh

210
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,440

211
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,919

where you'll reach me reach out to any

216
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,679
of the communities i've said and you'll

217
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,519
find that there's hundreds of people who

218
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,640
are

219
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,120
stressing about having to do great

220
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,320
report while they're stressing about

221
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,680
this one about the other vulnerability

222
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,440
and there are people who sit down yeah

223
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,640
run through with you we'll spend a bit

224
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,160
of time we'll work it out

225
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,480
and that's that's unique yeah

226
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,839
yeah that's pretty much it

227
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,240
i don't i know i'm got no idea how long

228
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,839
this is meant to last for i've probably

229
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,440
only been talking for like three minutes

230
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,880
because that's all it feels like in my

231
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,320
head but yeah kind of keep it to keep it

232
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,160
quite short keep it quite sweet i know

233
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,320
we'll have a few issues early on so yeah

234
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
that's kind of the main thing the

235
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,080
community side if there's any uh

236
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,770
[Music]

237
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,120
uh the community is the lifeblood of

238
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,600
eventful sack with uh people like you

239
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,360
people like any of the people here

240
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
people like people there and a lot of

241
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,959
the community resources out there

242
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,600
wouldn't be anything use them be part of

243
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,279
them do her

244
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,760
contribute towards them make content

245
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,480
make everyone else better that's

246
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,839
the key in infosec that's the key in how

247
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,560
we fix the horrendous shitstorm we're

248
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,160
going through seriously again we're

249
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,920
going through today with all of the

250
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,600
vulnerabilities again again there is a

251
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,360
month before there isn't p1 there is no

252
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,800
set there isn't a critical there isn't

253
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,560
something going on and the only way

254
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,000
forward and that is to build that

255
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,839
community is to keep that community

256
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,000
together and it's to for everyone to

257
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,360
just reach out and work towards the

258
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
common goal of making everyone else more

259
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,480
secure

260
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,600
uh

261
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,480
