1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,839
not many people are discussing it at the

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,160
moment and then we'll

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,440
go on to

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,639
hack a spaceport um so one of the

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,320
projects that commercial space

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,720
technologies work on is the development

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,039
of space port one

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,400
so we'll be discussing cyber security

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,080
in a real life application and

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,599
love for all of you to get involved

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,119
hoping for this to be kind of

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,680
semi-structured but unstructured

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,079
discussion is fantastic and very much

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,040
welcomed um so first off i think it

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,760
would be best if i could kind of go

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,480
through

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,760
panelists um throw ian if you want to

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,120
kick off and introduce yourself sure um

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,440
ian thornton trump uh otherwise known as

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,280
fat hobbit online member of the beer

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,239
farmers

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,039
um

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,680
i'm broadly familiar with military

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,640
technology especially satellites and the

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,320
role they've played in the current

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,840
conflict

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,159
and know a little bit about nassau's

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,320
deep space network so

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,799
talk about that

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,880
hey guys i'm a donut mallow i'm a

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,159
security analyst for quorum cyber um

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,159
i'm not like too familiar with uh cyber

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,520
security in space like i'm familiar with

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,439
like the concepts in like space itself

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,000
and that's as well

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,400
i'm joe i've uh spent about 10 years

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,920
working in cyber security doing

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,680
different things from incident response

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
and security engineering

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,920
and my start in

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,200
cyber security came from learning about

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,119
privacy to protect

43
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,880
myself in terms of personal safety

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,360
hi my name is

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,640
a

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,040
management consultant i've worked with

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,640
uh autumn vodafone and i've also

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,439
recently helped with a steer consultancy

49
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,000
in london looking at a world bank pitch

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,240
to try and help satellites into

51
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,399
developing and third world countries

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,720
so i know nothing about cyber security

53
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,160
and everything about the people who need

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,720
it if it comes

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,760
fantastic um

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,720
in terms of of of cyber security in

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,040
space today we'll be discussing both the

58
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,160
kind of downstream which is the the

59
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,080
rockets the satellites that are

60
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,280
generating the data sets uh as well as

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,120
the upstream and that's the the the

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,200
just the raw data and information that

63
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,840
you take from these space assets

64
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,920
um i don't know if ian if you've got

65
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,440
some opening comments on that

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
sure so

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,519
just broadly speaking militaries in

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,519
general have been putting stuff up in

69
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,800
space since the early days of sputnik um

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,640
we're now at a place where we have these

71
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,920
very sophisticated data centers in just

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,680
some of the worst physical conditions

73
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,920
you could imagine ranging from hundreds

74
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,720
of degrees centigrade down to almost

75
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,680
zero

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,080
the tolerances required on the actual

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,200
physical things are extraordinary um

78
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,440
also we know that space is a very

79
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,840
hostile place

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,080
and the fact that you can't be heard

81
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,120
screaming um but the hostility of the

82
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,959
space was um graphically i remember uh

83
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,200
graphically displayed when elon musk due

84
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,440
to a solar flare lost about 40 starlings

85
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,080
and basically flushed about 150 million

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,720
i think it was down the toilet

87
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,200
right there um so

88
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,760
to sort of give you a better sense to

89
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,680
the real implications of things like

90
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
space and space technology from a

91
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,000
military perspective is all about

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,159
looking at things and listening to

93
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,120
things

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,519
and those platforms we used to call them

95
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,599
keyhole satellites they've now

96
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,760
gone beyond the capabilities that you

97
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,400
see in the movies in a lot of respects

98
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,239
but i would say the one thing that you

99
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,400
have to understand is it's the data that

100
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,760
they gathered which is the most

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,959
important asset uh from the platforms

102
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,159
themselves

103
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,239
so i think i've said enough why don't we

104
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,439
get some

105
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,040
do we have any other kind of opening

106
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,199
comments

107
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,639
yeah i think one of the

108
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,399
applications is is also looking at

109
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,240
things like gps because that actually

110
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,840
forms one of the most important so most

111
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,960
people

112
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
came here today by car or even walked

113
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,400
here if you don't know where you're

114
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,320
coming you use gps and you only have to

115
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,560
look at the current citation to just now

116
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,800
with

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,759
my company's finish based one of them

118
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,000
and the funds are having a big a lot of

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,440
problems flying planes in and out of

120
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
helsinki just now because there's lots

121
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,919
of jamming of gps going on

122
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,759
so we all know where we get the gps form

123
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,160
so it actually has a real world effect

124
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
on us all just now so i can cover all

125
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,639
the comments

126
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,800
so space

127
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,680
underpins our kind of day-to-day life

128
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,160
whether that's in communications

129
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,199
um even simply logging onto the internet

130
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,000
if that's navigation gps

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,960
or if it's using earth observation data

132
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
through applications like google earth

133
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,080
or

134
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,759
maybe even google maps

135
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,960
um

136
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,039
right now there's a huge growth within

137
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,199
the sector in scotland

138
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,960
and i think it's important that we're

139
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,479
discussing this today

140
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,680
because

141
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,919
there's a high likelihood that any one

142
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,680
of you in this room might be working

143
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,880
within the sector or at least working on

144
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,520
space projects in the near-term future

145
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,280
and if you're not working on space

146
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
projects you might be using data that's

147
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,000
derived from space assets uh almost

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,680
undoubtedly

149
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,360
so it's important that

150
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,840
you have an understanding of some of the

151
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,160
problems that

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,120
may come from using these data sets or

153
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,759
um could arise in future

154
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,520
um

155
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,720
one of the

156
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,759
the the reasons for this growth um

157
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,000
within this kind of stock photography

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,280
showing growth

159
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,160
is what's called the new space paradigm

160
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,960
and

161
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,080
this is coming from a an increased risk

162
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,160
tolerance um

163
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,440
driving forward

164
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,360
driving forward kind of smaller

165
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,080
miniaturized technologies that have an

166
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,720
increased risk tolerance but because of

167
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,600
this uh cyber security and security in

168
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,520
general is not

169
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,479
really been taken into account these are

170
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,800
small satellites with almost zero

171
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,759
redundancy about the size of a loaf of

172
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,319
bread and this is this is where a lot of

173
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,240
the growth in space is coming from

174
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,919
especially in scotland

175
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,800
um

176
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,280
whether that's developing these small

177
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,680
satellites or planning to launch these

178
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,280
small satellites

179
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,599
um

180
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,199
i don't know if you guys have any

181
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,960
comments on maybe

182
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,080
lean startups and

183
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,479
cyber security

184
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,360
part of my remit as well as to help

185
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,039
companies that are coming in from

186
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,960
outside into scotland and the uk's

187
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,599
internationally so one of the real sort

188
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,759
of measures doesn't matter if you're

189
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,759
looking at satellites loss of bread or

190
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,599
bringing in health

191
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,960
solutions from abroad as as

192
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,120
we are quite uh

193
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,800
we're quite risk averse and we're quite

194
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,639
uh governance heavy

195
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,800
but that's not a bad thing because even

196
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,560
when you look at like the finish who you

197
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,319
expect to be quite straight-laced

198
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,840
they've got a very lazy fear attitude

199
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,800
towards most things security-wise

200
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
and i think that is a starter for 10

201
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,560
that it doesn't matter where you're

202
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,000
working you know you've got to make sure

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,759
stuff is buttoned up even down to things

204
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,039
like gdpr

205
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,800
which is the simplest thing

206
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,160
some people are just putting as a

207
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,560
masthead on their website and it's not

208
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,960
actually lived out inside their company

209
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,039
so i do think there's there's that with

210
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,639
with small businesses small businesses

211
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,840
have uh

212
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,280
the best small business you can ever go

213
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,960
and work for is the two guys that have

214
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,280
done their ice or 27 000 and one because

215
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
they they've just done it

216
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,800
the worst one is the one work from the

217
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,080
is the one who's

218
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
who's working towards it for the last

219
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,680
six years

220
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,840
so you can make your own mind up without

221
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
one

222
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,199
that's definitely true i mean i've

223
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,680
worked on satellite projects in the past

224
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,840
where there's there's just if you knew

225
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
the codes in order to command the

226
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,200
satellites

227
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,919
anybody could come along and and mess

228
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,958
with this and this is industry-wide um

229
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,599
so there's there's there's not i mean

230
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,919
two years ago i was at a cyber security

231
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,839
and space event and there's been

232
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,839
absolutely no change since then um

233
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,279
there's not

234
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,440
a general acceptance on um

235
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,560
how to manage data from in a secure way

236
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,959
and but more importantly how to manage

237
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,480
your space assets in a secure way um

238
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,120
and that's yeah throughout the upstream

239
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,399
and downstream

240
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,160
and even in the downstream where you've

241
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,480
got these huge huge

242
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,680
um

243
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,440
story but huge ass huge data assets um

244
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,880
and and there's just

245
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,000
no

246
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,959
security being taken seriously

247
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,320
yeah there's been some really

248
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,480
interesting uh hacks that have been

249
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,560
conducted against space platforms

250
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,440
kaspersky came out with a report

251
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,200
of the satellites being used at c2 nodes

252
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,519
for malware which you know we're

253
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,839
piggybacking on the exactly the

254
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,920
telemetry data and

255
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,360
of the satellites

256
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,760
um you'll remember this very

257
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,000
embarrassing moment that happened to the

258
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,760
americans uh somebody with google up

259
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,560
tell me the cost of a global hawk

260
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,480
just google that right now

261
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,080
how much one of those is and then just

262
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,959
yell out that price

263
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,519
bueller

264
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,920
let's go

265
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,519
thank you so a global hawk is one of

266
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,000
many drones that the united states uses

267
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,399
to conduct either surveillance this is a

268
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,800
surveillance only platform it doesn't

269
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,399
you know have rockets and bombs and

270
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,920
stuff like that um but that global hawk

271
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,200
was captured by the iranians in an

272
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,040
intelligence operation that managed to

273
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,680
compromise its gps which was what the

274
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,640
public was told and it was landed as a

275
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,120
result of spoofing its gps and then it

276
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
was completely disassembled and torn

277
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,360
apart by chinese people

278
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,160
so

279
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,640
this is a great example of the

280
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,360
insecurities involved in the satellite

281
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,000
system can then play out in various

282
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,320
different ways for espionage because

283
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,760
actually one of the most important

284
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,079
things to know is what the bad guys

285
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,519
depending on which side you're aligned

286
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,079
is are looking out on the ground because

287
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,440
if they're looking at something on the

288
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,880
ground and you know they're looking at

289
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,800
something on the ground it's time to

290
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,200
move quickly so

291
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,320
this whole ecosystem of the drones and

292
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,959
the surveillance and um actual satellite

293
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,720
surveillance capabilities is known as

294
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,600
geospatial intel and that is one of the

295
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
things is being used and successfully

296
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,680
exploited by the ukrainians those

297
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,640
turkish bicarb drones are controlled by

298
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,200
a commercial satellite network

299
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,440
that basically you can buy one and fly

300
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,839
it all around yourselves

301
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,240
it's definitely a good point and there's

302
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
within the ukrainian conflict it's been

303
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,440
a very good example of um

304
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,920
different nations taking control of

305
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,800
different space assets and there's been

306
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,480
several hacks both of russian satellite

307
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,240
assets uh but also claimed hacks of of

308
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,880
nato space assets as well in order to

309
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,760
obtain that geospatial information as to

310
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,000
what's going on in the ground and and

311
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,160
that just underlines the

312
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,000
uh importance of and value of that data

313
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,279
to to the the data users and and people

314
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,399
that need that key information um but

315
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,720
what's what's important about this is

316
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,240
these kind of james bond scenarios uh

317
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,560
with the bad guys kind of crashing

318
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,480
things into each other um are now

319
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,600
becoming more possible and more likely

320
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,279
um it's it's now kind of possible to uh

321
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,639
obtain the codes in order to

322
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,920
do hostile maneuvers and satellites

323
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,000
maybe kind of uh

324
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,279
putting them in

325
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,000
putting an orbital maneuver in so that

326
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
um

327
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,839
things crash into each other and that

328
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,920
might sound apocalyptic

329
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,040
uh but it's it's it there's a real kind

330
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,680
of potential for that to happen

331
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,959
um

332
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,760
and satellite programs can can take up

333
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,680
to they can take

334
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,600
they all take around 24 months and

335
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,279
that's on the low end

336
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,639
um

337
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,040
there's a massive effect in revenues if

338
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,920
you you take a satellite asset out if

339
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,639
you don't have a space asset it's not

340
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,880
going to generate data which is going

341
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,680
not going to generate money so that's a

342
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,200
huge problem

343
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,600
but also the the

344
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,839
cost of putting something in space

345
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,720
um it costs the same amount for the the

346
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,160
equivalent weight in gold generally um

347
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,120
that's a good way to look at it

348
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,880
um

349
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,240
and then there's also a thing called

350
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,079
kessler syndrome which

351
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,079
um could be

352
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,160
used by a

353
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,760
hostile um actor in order to

354
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,639
make

355
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,800
nobody be able to use space if you crash

356
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,040
one thing into each into one thing it

357
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,360
could cause a chain reaction which then

358
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
ruins it for everybody

359
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,199
um

360
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,040
i don't know if you guys have any kind

361
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,199
of inputs on on hostile space actors or

362
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,000
maybe actors that could cause these kind

363
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,920
of actions and and how to to prevent

364
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,839
these kind of problems from a high level

365
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,279
so tying this into

366
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,480
what we've already discussed as well

367
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,079
when you're looking at communicating

368
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,160
with satellites

369
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,839
like to maybe liken that to

370
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,120
wi-fi and

371
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,360
if you can hack wi-fi

372
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,519
this kind of affects a room

373
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,480
and

374
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,560
you know maybe you can use a pringles

375
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,160
can to make a directional antenna and

376
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
you can get a kilometer range on wi-fi

377
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,600
but ultimately it's always going to be

378
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,360
quite limited

379
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,519
whereas with satellite communication you

380
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,120
can kind of assume that everybody in

381
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,880
your hemisphere is probably going to be

382
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,360
able to intercept that in some way

383
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,600
and there was an article in the

384
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,760
intercept some years ago

385
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,199
showing

386
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,320
some

387
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,839
interception of drone feeds in israel

388
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,160
so in that case it was kind of passive

389
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,399
eavesdropping on the feeds between the

390
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,040
satellites and the drones

391
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,959
i think in terms of

392
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,480
risks for collisions in space if you can

393
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,560
passively eavesdrop

394
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,639
it might also be possible

395
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,360
to actually send commands to to

396
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,519
satellites as well

397
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,399
i think

398
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,440
as a kind of high level defense we need

399
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,839
to make sure that the cryptography

400
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,839
that's being used to authenticate the

401
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,759
communications and encrypt the

402
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,000
communications is really sound

403
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,759
and if you think about how long it took

404
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,120
uh wi-fi

405
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,800
to come from the kind of dreadful

406
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,560
standards that it was at 20 years ago to

407
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,000
the kind of

408
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,240
pretty reasonable wpa3 standards that we

409
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,519
have now

410
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,560
i think

411
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,000
this is something that we really should

412
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,720
be focusing on

413
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,959
it's a really good point and and a lot

414
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,040
of the frequencies as well that

415
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,320
satellites use are very similar to wi-fi

416
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,440
and you can use a a directional kind of

417
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,959
yagi antenna in order to capture the the

418
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,680
uhf signals down and you could command

419
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,240
them up with vhf as well so there's

420
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,000
there is definitely a a um

421
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,759
a possibility of piggy in the middle

422
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,040
attacks where you're just kind of

423
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,440
listening in and then kind of doing your

424
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,399
own thing

425
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,000
um

426
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,320
do you have any kind of insight into the

427
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,560
piggy in the middle attacks

428
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,519
not not exactly um but like it's not

429
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,920
occurred to me like um like space travel

430
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,399
becomes more and more dominant like in

431
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,639
the future and like you try to travel

432
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,399
with other planets like eons trying to

433
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,880
like travel to mars at the moment um i

434
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,279
think it's like comes apparently and

435
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,959
threat actors may turn their attention

436
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,800
towards likes of satellites as we

437
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,199
mentioned and you know use ransomware to

438
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,880
like hold these like satellites hostage

439
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,680
so people may not be able to watch tv or

440
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,519
be able to communicate properly with

441
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,560
them

442
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,759
back to the command and control so like

443
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,119
it might be the case of like you know

444
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,119
run somewhere we'll have like a new like

445
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,599
kind of like dominance in space with

446
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,199
straight actors just again turning our

447
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,079
attention towards it so yeah

448
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,319
yes a very good point about ransomware

449
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,520
and um i mean it's it's a huge huge kind

450
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,839
of um aspect to cyber security in

451
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,039
general but um being able to capture a

452
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,799
space asset and then convert that into

453
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,880
a kind of ransom

454
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,520
take it hostage effectively is is a real

455
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,559
threat too um

456
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,720
is there is there any kind of we've

457
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,919
we've had a very brief overview of of

458
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,880
the the need for cyber security in space

459
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,440
um is there any kind of points that you

460
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,919
guys would like to make before we we do

461
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,679
a dive into the

462
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,440
our our kind of case study

463
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,760
i think yeah again it comes back to the

464
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
you know the weakest point so we talk

465
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,600
about all the assets we've had up there

466
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,280
for 30 years which have been mostly

467
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,360
military we mostly assumed

468
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,960
that we're all buttoned up and we're as

469
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,400
secure as possible now what i think

470
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,840
you're saying i think from that is

471
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,960
you've now got

472
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,120
uh sort of commercial partners up there

473
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,400
who may not have the same level of

474
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,559
security so just imagine this

475
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,760
uh

476
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,080
just say that loaf of bread satellite is

477
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,000
of course two million pounds can take

478
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,760
out

479
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,080
well just pick a figure

480
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,640
what 900 million pounds

481
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,039
satellite system can be taken out that's

482
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,799
when it starts really worried so you

483
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,960
know if again you look at the the sort

484
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,280
of industry i'm because i'd mostly do

485
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,679
some stuff in health even if you want to

486
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,000
put a health device into the market now

487
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,679
you've got to have an iso around about

488
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,400
it

489
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,200
so if you want to do a diabetes meter or

490
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,640
you want to do something to do you have

491
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,799
an iso roundabout so every company's got

492
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,160
to assume and that iso

493
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,080
13845 is normally a fairly standard sort

494
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,160
of cyber security thing that means that

495
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,240
even at its weakest everybody's doing

496
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,520
the same action

497
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,080
so then it shuts out most of the the the

498
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,039
risk

499
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,679
but if what you're saying and um

500
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,280
should be sent out there by the way so

501
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,559
if what you're saying is you make me

502
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,760
really worried now because what you're

503
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,400
saying is somebody can simply bash

504
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,799
something smaller into something bigger

505
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,480
and i lose

506
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,799
love island

507
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,039
do it anytime you want

508
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,960
i'll jump i'll jump into that one

509
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,080
absolutely true so obviously you know

510
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,679
nassau is a great example they have

511
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,360
something called the deep space network

512
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,240
which is essentially tcp in space

513
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,760
and what they're doing with that

514
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,400
primarily right now is taking data from

515
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,640
the mars observer

516
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,360
and

517
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,760
controlling their little robots on the

518
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,280
surface of mars

519
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,039
really really cool

520
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,320
they don't want somebody else

521
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,679
controlling those robots and they're the

522
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,600
whole infrastructure that you're dealing

523
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,240
with is billions of dollars in

524
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,520
intellectual property and investment so

525
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,080
from a threat actor perspective if i

526
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
could do something like that and wreck

527
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,600
that it's a massive expense that they

528
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,960
that the country has incurred

529
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
and they're not going to get it back

530
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,039
right especially if you start crashing

531
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,120
stuff into stuff right

532
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,120
so so i think there's this data

533
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,640
protection story that now becomes really

534
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,039
really important and it's along all

535
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,120
three of those confidentiality integrity

536
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,600
and availability triangles that it's

537
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,159
really important it's really expensive

538
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,240
and we have to make sure that it's

539
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,640
tamper-proof right

540
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,600
and

541
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,280
just on that as well um the

542
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
there's there's huge timelines

543
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,520
particularly on the the military and

544
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,919
governmental side of satellite

545
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,640
development and looking at james webb

546
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,320
for example you're you're looking at a

547
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,720
timeline of about 25

548
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
years for the development of that of

549
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,760
that satellite so you're you're using

550
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,480
security architectures that are

551
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,120
massively outdated so

552
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,159
i i wouldn't trust the the the kind of

553
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,840
the integrity of of that hardware either

554
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,400
to be honest the the small stuff a lot

555
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,159
of it's just kind of bowling balls in

556
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,720
space they haven't got maneuverability

557
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,480
so they they just kind of go round and

558
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,120
round and round until they degrade but

559
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,240
um the older stuff is is potentially an

560
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,360
issue

561
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,880
i don't know

562
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,559
if you've got

563
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,240
any other than that

564
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,919
just

565
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:42,799
kind of

566
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,559
maybe not totally related but what you

567
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,760
kind of made me think of when you're

568
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,320
saying that there's uh this like 20 year

569
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,640
old technology up in space i mean you

570
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,799
know my iphone gets an update like once

571
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,400
a month so

572
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,559
if there is this technology that's up

573
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,400
there and maybe security hasn't been

574
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,559
considered as well as it could have been

575
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,880
20 years ago and

576
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,919
you know this is something that we

577
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,919
should probably change in terms of of

578
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,240
making these satellites updateable

579
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,490
and

580
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,600
[Music]

581
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,200
because you know then we can

582
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,039
retroactively patch the security

583
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,400
problems that we put in space

584
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,799
it is possible to kind of

585
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,880
upgrade firmware but it is it is

586
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,600
difficult within within space to do that

587
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,720
because

588
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,440
on a lot of the big space missions you

589
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
you have these iso standards but it

590
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,679
means that your your frameworks can be

591
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,880
quite rigid and and unresponsive because

592
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,520
if you patch your firmware there's the

593
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,039
possibility that you could break

594
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,400
everything as well

595
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,679
um where i mean if you've got huge

596
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,960
geostationary com satellite um

597
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,640
taking that out of commission because

598
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,440
you you've done a a bad patch would be

599
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,000
catastrophic um so there's there's the

600
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,120
need for

601
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,320
um

602
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,720
kind of very time intensive reviews of

603
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
the code

604
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,000
yeah definitely i mean you're kind of

605
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,240
you're balancing the risk between

606
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,640
uh making the satellite unusable which

607
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,120
is a disaster but also potentially

608
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,520
leaving some kind of remote exploitation

609
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,440
in there where it could actually be used

610
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,880
to cause damage and in the way that

611
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,320
we've discussed

612
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,080
but there there are different types

613
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,440
was mentioned about the um spacex and

614
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,280
elon musk losing loads of starlink

615
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,480
satellites and with them being much

616
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,919
cheaper um there's there's not that same

617
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,559
um needs or

618
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,120
there's there's assets can be expendable

619
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,280
in in certain regards but

620
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,520
um

621
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,600
unless there's any other kind of points

622
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,840
on on the the overview of of of space

623
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,880
and cyber we can we can jump into our

624
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,440
kind of case study so today we're going

625
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,960
to kind of look into hacking a spaceport

626
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,320
and

627
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,559
seeing how we can create as many

628
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,880
problems within the operation of a

629
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,919
spaceport uh looking at how we can smash

630
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,640
rockets into the ground cause explosions

631
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,559
all of that fun stuff

632
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,080
so spaceport one is a

633
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,279
sub-orbital uh sounding rocket site on

634
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,080
northeast there's the potential for for

635
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,640
orbital launch in future as well

636
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,039
um with sub-orbital launch this is where

637
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:27,760
you

638
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,320
launch a rocket and it comes back down

639
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,600
again so it might go up to 250 400

640
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,799
kilometers before landing in the sea and

641
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,240
within that there's experiments done um

642
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,799
the sounding rocket could be guided so

643
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,760
it could

644
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,720
um

645
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,520
try to attempt to go to certain

646
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,279
uh places of interest for researchers or

647
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,200
for commercial partners that are looking

648
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,080
to

649
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,799
qualify components software and things

650
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,840
like this

651
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,880
for future commercial missions

652
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,960
um so the

653
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,240
the the digital architecture of space

654
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,880
port one currently looks like this with

655
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,080
with two servers one with a an open

656
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,760
network which is connected to the

657
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,600
internet and a a kind of closed network

658
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,559
that is not connected to the network but

659
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,600
has

660
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,400
uh

661
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,760
some

662
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,000
[Music]

663
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,320
connection to the to the range in order

664
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,120
to exchange data on operations

665
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,840
the admin side is connected to the

666
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,720
internet as well as

667
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,640
some aspects of

668
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,799
security and operations

669
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:41,600
the

670
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,000
security is within

671
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,960
the

672
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,240
open network due to the um

673
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,360
the need uh or the demands of having

674
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,919
that infrastructure uh within a closed

675
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,320
network so there'd be like fiber optics

676
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,840
and and

677
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,919
kind of secure microwave links that

678
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,559
would be required so it makes it kind of

679
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,240
economically infeasible to to have that

680
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,840
on on the

681
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,640
closed network at this point in time

682
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,240
but in terms of the the kind of

683
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,400
connections that you would have

684
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,320
um from a a social standpoint as well

685
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,559
uh within a launch

686
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,360
um you'd have a mission manager who

687
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,279
would give a kind of go or no go

688
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,600
and and you've got a kind of vast team

689
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,120
around them that provides information

690
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,559
uh

691
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,760
coordination with with local air traffic

692
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,919
management airspace and sea space to

693
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,919
make sure that there are no kind of

694
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,240
stragglers and no people that

695
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,000
are are

696
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
where they shouldn't be

697
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,919
if if they were in that space it could

698
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,039
be a big risk um so there's there's

699
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,360
there's coordination of that space as

700
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,200
well as a whole launch team that ensures

701
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,360
the um

702
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,279
the safe operation

703
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,880
of the launch

704
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,440
um and as well there's there's other

705
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,120
coordinations between the mission

706
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,679
manager and others on on the engineering

707
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,360
side but this this whole

708
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,240
team is is required for for safe

709
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,520
operation of the site now one thing to

710
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,919
mention on this as well is that a lot of

711
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,440
the communications here in terms of go

712
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,480
no go

713
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,799
are done over

714
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,520
uhf kind of standard business radios

715
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
i don't know if we should kind of hand

716
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,600
over and

717
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,000
what are your guys thoughts on the

718
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,559
system how would you go about

719
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,840
breaking

720
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,440
causing problems

721
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,640
to the the users of the site

722
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,279
um disrupting operations

723
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,480
breaking operations

724
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,320
does anybody fancy shoot from the head

725
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,640
i would leave it alone between probably

726
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,960
uh september and february the weather

727
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,679
take its course possibly

728
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,120
yeah i i i i think it's uh

729
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,080
it's it's all it's always as painful as

730
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,679
this weakest link isn't it so you've got

731
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,279
everything from people you looking look

732
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,640
at the canola virus coming through just

733
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,440
now

734
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,000
uh lots of people inside critical

735
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,200
infrastructure just now are being

736
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,480
protected

737
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,279
uh you know it's rife just now seeing

738
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,720
hospitals and everywhere else to try and

739
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,919
protect the teams that would be no

740
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,120
different here either as well

741
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,159
and i think as well as is

742
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,360
possibly

743
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,159
understanding exactly what the

744
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,200
what the risk could be to any of the

745
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,960
infrastructures and including the the

746
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,559
communications as well

747
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,720
because you're you're only ever as as

748
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,600
good as your your weakest link i think

749
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,279
so do you think there's

750
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,480
uh in terms of social engineering and

751
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,799
things like this yeah i mean it says

752
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,799
well i mean if if just say they were

753
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,480
putting something up that the chinese

754
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,000
didn't want to go up

755
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,080
yeah yeah you're on everything then

756
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,120
you're on

757
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,200
all the sort of i mean i i've been

758
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,960
talking to quite a lot of the people

759
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,720
hear about careers and what they want to

760
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,960
do and every time i ask somebody about

761
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,679
you know pixie things your bank account

762
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,240
your social media presence or your your

763
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,399
health data which one do you most want

764
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,720
to protect and everybody says banking

765
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,799
they're all nuts it's it's it's the one

766
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,080
you want to protect your health data

767
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,399
because if you've had a good dose of a

768
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,200
sexually transmitted disease i i could

769
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,760
be using that to blackmail you

770
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,200
then i've got you so it's it's it's

771
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,320
if somebody wants to do something

772
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,360
they're going to do it i think somebody

773
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,880
laughing in there so that was the person

774
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,640
that acts demise to

775
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,559
prove that herpes was worse than losing

776
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,480
a thousand pounds so that's the person

777
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,279
that has your health data

778
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,679
sure i'll go

779
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,240
um i i mean obviously getting a hold of

780
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,840
a rocket and being able to drop it

781
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,320
somewhere would be really cool i didn't

782
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,080
know that scotland had ballistic missile

783
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
technology so you're right up there with

784
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,480
the north koreans right firing stuff

785
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,919
into the ocean every time they think

786
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,760
godzilla is coming out

787
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,679
anyways um

788
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,440
you we need to bridge the air gap

789
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,279
because that's where the fun stuff is

790
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,120
right so we either need to recruit

791
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,159
somebody or have somebody make a mistake

792
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,360
right or

793
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,080
get in there with uh a pony or something

794
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,399
like that right so that we can try and

795
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,320
get access to the range network that

796
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,480
would be the primary one

797
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,720
because the range network

798
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,880
is what it is it needs intrusion

799
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,200
detection systems as part of its

800
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,279
security envelope because you can't just

801
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,840
say oh it's not connected right you need

802
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,480
to make sure that it's not connected the

803
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,000
only way to do that is to make sure that

804
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,080
you've got the necessary sort of like

805
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,200
detection

806
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,520
set up so that if it now suddenly can

807
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,360
route itself to the internet that's a

808
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,960
problem and that needs to show up right

809
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,440
away right the other thing that you can

810
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,600
do which is going to be

811
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,760
difficult is you've got to know a little

812
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,840
bit about the technology you're using in

813
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,240
order to get and piggyback on the

814
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,799
telemetry that you're sending mr rocket

815
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,279
right and you know i remember a long

816
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,799
time ago when i was growing up there's

817
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,960
these tin tins and in one of the tin

818
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,039
tins i think it was explorer on the moon

819
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,039
that's exactly what a hostile nation

820
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,279
state did which was basically they were

821
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,000
able to take you know the tintins rocket

822
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,640
and you know mess it up in flight so

823
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,440
it's a realistic threat model for sure

824
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,679
i just don't know about in terms of the

825
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,919
modern technology of it is that you

826
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,919
could um send fake telemetry data to the

827
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,399
operators right and steer it towards

828
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,640
like glasgow or something right so

829
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,159
you're so they're looking at their

830
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,799
screen the old stuxnet type of attack

831
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,919
they're looking at their screen

832
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,679
everything's okay everything's okay

833
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,360
meanwhile all your centrifuges are

834
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,519
exploding right so it's the same idea

835
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,679
here that we could pretend everything is

836
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,039
fine while we're

837
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,039
what we're pushing it you know towards

838
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,960
the southern parts of

839
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,640
the uk

840
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,600
yeah but but no you want to hit paisley

841
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,039
yeah

842
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:09,919
you know because we call that

843
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,880
regeneration in paisley

844
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,519
the the operations of the vehicle and

845
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,720
there's what's called a flight

846
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,399
termination system

847
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,880
and that's controlled generally with a

848
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,039
heart a radio heartbeat that would just

849
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,559
be sent to the um to the

850
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,960
the the rocket and if if there isn't

851
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,039
that heartbeat detected it would just

852
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,000
blow up

853
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,840
um the other the other way it could be

854
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,880
done is is if there's any kind of signal

855
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,120
on a certain frequency it would just

856
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,559
blow up the rocket

857
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,519
um

858
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,559
so there's

859
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,600
there's two potential things there um

860
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,519
if if you want to send it to glasgow you

861
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,960
probably need to have some kind of um

862
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,360
system that allowed for

863
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,600
uh the flight termination system not to

864
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
be

865
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,158
ignited

866
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,760
yeah i mean the stuxnet example has

867
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,360
already been taken

868
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,080
but

869
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,760
i think it is still a good example of

870
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,600
how an air gap is not necessarily enough

871
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,039
to protect your programmable logic

872
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,200
controllers and just data systems and i

873
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,880
think that these systems are still

874
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,399
really really difficult to defend in

875
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,519
general

876
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,320
and

877
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,480
in those examples where you can send

878
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,880
data that looks perfectly legitimate to

879
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,559
the engineers behind it

880
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,679
it's very difficult to tell the

881
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,960
difference between a hack and an

882
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,640
accident

883
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,440
that's a good point

884
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,720
because i seen the in the second

885
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,399
screenshot was iot devices so like

886
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,600
possibly looking for like vulnerable

887
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,200
devices that could be like you know

888
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,440
possibly open to the internet or

889
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,760
like poor security to them attached like

890
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,600
for password um

891
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,000
uh health so like trying to have like a

892
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,559
go like see like what kind of the iot

893
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,760
places are they evolve like um are there

894
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,079
any exploits available to them like just

895
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,760
having like a go really from there and

896
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,359
just seeing like can i be able to get

897
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,879
into these iot devices and connect

898
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,239
straight to the rocket and then from

899
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,440
there you could be able to mess with

900
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,599
like maybe able to tell the crash on

901
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,399
like re-entry or just tough to blow up

902
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,599
because you know

903
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,359
with the history of like space accidents

904
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,280
i mean people might not know like it's

905
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,199
like a malicious attack that could just

906
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,040
be like there could be fault with

907
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,520
the engine or something

908
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,440
that's like probably the way just like

909
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,200
iot devices just be a good way

910
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,679
there is one way to get across that air

911
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,679
gap and i think some researchers at

912
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,359
defcon about four or five years ago

913
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,679
demonstrated using the speaker to pulse

914
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,960
information

915
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,199
from a speaker on the inside of the

916
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,640
network to the microphone on a laptop

917
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,320
and there you could

918
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,800
have malware uh the only problem with

919
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,359
that is that um you really would have to

920
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,079
know

921
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,560
physically wrecking the place so you can

922
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,440
get that those connections so if the

923
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,839
range is also physically isolated like

924
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,720
in a you know glass partition you you

925
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,880
have difficulties but it is possible to

926
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,320
get across that air gap with technology

927
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,760
i just wondered as well

928
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,000
how often or how quickly we come to the

929
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,680
minds of the people doing this how often

930
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,920
they should actually set up a red team

931
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,480
to be constantly going at them i suppose

932
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,400
that's what they do that we don't know

933
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,240
about because if you look at things like

934
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,400
the british nuclear police

935
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
which my brother went for but they

936
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,240
decided not to give him a gun which was

937
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,119
a good idea uh is that

938
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,359
they are constantly so

939
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,240
again

940
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,839
to tell those no secrets here but you

941
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,000
know that they put things like the sas

942
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,160
up against nuclear stations and they're

943
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,520
part of their

944
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,839
the military police is to protect the

945
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,119
place but it's not just about the

946
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,720
obvious protections about this the

947
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,160
unobvious about

948
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,599
folks you know you know yourself if you

949
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,880
want to get in some place just by high

950
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,560
vis on in a ladder and you can walk in

951
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,200
anywhere i mean it was that's constantly

952
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,960
in the place and i don't i mean we

953
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,079
although these this is a really

954
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,400
sophisticated environment sometimes it's

955
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,119
the really basic stuff that trips people

956
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,000
up so again you would for this you would

957
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,560
be expecting that any air gaps or any

958
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
physical security would be constantly

959
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,760
being

960
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,160
tested because i beg you that's probably

961
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,440
the last thing in their minds that

962
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,040
somebody might want again

963
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,400
first of all you'd have to get to used

964
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,839
in the first place so let's say

965
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,599
congratulations to somebody from china

966
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,160
or russia or somewhere and get into eust

967
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,480
probably with the accent up there you

968
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,599
would notice the difference in the

969
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,599
russian person getting a narrow or

970
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,440
something from local but i just i just

971
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,560
wonder all these things i just wonder

972
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,240
sometimes i think that

973
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,480
because it's so sophisticated we forget

974
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,280
about the easy stuff i suppose

975
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,440
that's a good point i am i'm wondering

976
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,240
if there's anybody in the audience at

977
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,839
this point they would like to kind of

978
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,279
chime in with the cube

979
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,040
throw in

980
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,240
oh seems like it's working awesome

981
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,839
see like when you when you mentioned

982
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,800
that um tcp and space thing uh that

983
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,480
really got me thinking

984
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,119
uh about to kind of contextualize this

985
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,280
um when we look at malware today

986
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,480
you know this is a thing that's being

987
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,560
sold as a service uh and there are

988
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,320
botnet operators that have botnets and

989
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,440
they sell them

990
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,280
uh to malware authors in order to

991
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,040
distribute their malware so it got me

992
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,480
thinking you know like

993
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,400
what stops anyone from

994
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,599
turning

995
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,839
a satellite or a bunch of satellites

996
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,320
into effectively a space botnet

997
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,240
uh in order to distribute certain types

998
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,000
of data so i'm curious if you had any

999
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,480
ideas of how to we would kind of

1000
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,359
try and protect our satellite satellites

1001
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,839
against that

1002
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,079
it's really going to come down to

1003
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,000
to having some sort of integrity

1004
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,400
checking on the firmware updates

1005
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,520
right so

1006
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,560
in order

1007
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,480
generally the satellite is going to be

1008
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,079
two components right a firmware

1009
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,000
component and then software that's

1010
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,560
running on

1011
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,480
microprocessors within that so at

1012
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,880
sophisticated actor you're 100 right

1013
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,880
could get in there to maintain

1014
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,720
persistence they'd want to do a firmware

1015
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,960
update right and then they would also

1016
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,760
want to insert code in order to

1017
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,839
essentially use it

1018
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,079
i would say probably in a in a capacity

1019
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,119
that is not detectable right for more

1020
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,680
for espionage but there's no reason why

1021
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,440
and we saw this with the russians in the

1022
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,680
early stages of ukraine that they had

1023
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,800
built a botnet uh thousands of of

1024
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,079
devices out of iot routers i believe it

1025
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,240
was and they were using it for denial

1026
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,720
service attacks on the ukrainian

1027
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,320
internet

1028
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,880
to assist so you're 100 right you could

1029
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,440
use them as dos cannons

1030
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,520
from space which sounds really cool

1031
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,119
anybody will spend this time in there

1032
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,119
yeah i mean i think

1033
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,440
uh intrusion detection system and like a

1034
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,359
space intrusion detection system is

1035
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,800
probably something

1036
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,200
that we should consider developing in

1037
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
some way if it doesn't already exist

1038
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,760
and i think if you were to be using

1039
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,680
satellites to launch ddos attacks you'd

1040
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,079
see significant differences in the

1041
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,680
volume of traffic that they're sending

1042
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,800
so

1043
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,480
depending on how they use the botnet

1044
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,960
many botnets are not too difficult to

1045
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,880
actually detect

1046
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,040
because they're doing

1047
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,560
very obvious tasks like like ddos

1048
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,480
another point to make is that most

1049
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,880
satellites are running kind of embedded

1050
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,720
computers and normally kind of using

1051
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,599
an operating system like freertos that's

1052
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,200
been highly kind of modified for for the

1053
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,520
the hardware that they're running so

1054
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,079
that there isn't a kind of um it would

1055
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,280
be quite difficult to develop a botnet

1056
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,440
um because it would need to be very

1057
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,880
specialized for each individual piece of

1058
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,440
hardware

1059
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,800
but however the with constellations

1060
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,000
um that's that could be a a real problem

1061
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,760
because you've got thousands of

1062
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,319
identical satellites

1063
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,119
where

1064
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,200
that might begin to make more sense

1065
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,200
is there anybody else with the cube

1066
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,760
um i think one thing that might have

1067
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,839
been skipped over a little bit was uh on

1068
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,960
the next slide uh with the operators was

1069
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,079
the uh uhf communication so that's uh

1070
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,359
open network

1071
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,240
um

1072
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,280
so emergency

1073
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,400
which is a services

1074
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
encrypted network um

1075
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,920
and one of the issues about the minute

1076
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,599
is there's quite some quite a low data

1077
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,960
transmission and they're trying to move

1078
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,119
over to 5g of a minute which is a open

1079
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,079
network

1080
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,920
but with this uh

1081
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,040
all of those

1082
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,480
that's that's actually a really

1083
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,000
interesting point that you brought up

1084
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,119
because there was that hack where um ai

1085
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,880
machine learning was used to impersonate

1086
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,119
a ceo that then transferred a whole

1087
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,960
bunch of money i think which

1088
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,200
happened to a german executive if i

1089
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,400
remember correctly

1090
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,720
so yeah i mean you could certainly

1091
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,079
potentially spoof a bunch of um

1092
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,200
uh

1093
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,240
voice commands um knowing the system you

1094
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,400
could also jam it completely but

1095
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,319
eventually they'd find you and give you

1096
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,000
a good beating i think so

1097
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,480
and that was actually used for a

1098
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,359
proposal for a kind of a go-no-go

1099
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,319
dashboard to to have a kind of some more

1100
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,760
integrity around the the go no go signal

1101
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,359
um

1102
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,760
it's yeah it's definitely a problem if

1103
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,520
you if you have somebody that's good at

1104
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,400
voices and you have a kind of poor radio

1105
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,280
connection um you could definitely spoof

1106
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,119
it i mean there's there's more

1107
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,319
sophisticated ways as well but um yeah

1108
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,960
way up there good good throw in you'll

1109
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,160
get it

1110
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,560
take off

1111
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,640
and yeah obviously this is continuing on

1112
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,680
about the

1113
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,400
uhf one um

1114
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,240
are these even like are they are they

1115
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,440
even encrypted

1116
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,280
generally quite open connections and if

1117
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,040
it is open connections

1118
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,720
if you're doing some sort of emergency

1119
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,000
abort if even without

1120
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,480
bothering with all the clever things

1121
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,280
emulating someone's voice if you get if

1122
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,400
if you give an emergency aboard command

1123
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,079
they're not going to sit there for ages

1124
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,560
and think is this is this someone i work

1125
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,359
with voice they're going to hear someone

1126
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,520
shouting that there's an emergency

1127
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,200
possible which could be a situation

1128
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,960
where there's a risk to life

1129
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,640
killing them to a bar

1130
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,040
and obviously if you're jamming there'll

1131
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,960
be a consistent signal you could track

1132
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,560
if someone's just giving a very short

1133
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
abort transmission

1134
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,960
actually finding them

1135
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,359
they could continue popping about doing

1136
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,880
that and if they are emulating people's

1137
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,720
voices they could cause

1138
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,400
havoc for an extended period because

1139
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,599
they could transmit a move and

1140
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,119
tracking them down is going to involve

1141
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,119
having to like close off the area and

1142
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,440
search it for people

1143
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,760
with the range you can transmit at

1144
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,520
things like um

1145
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,280
i sail and

1146
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,640
we can have handhelds that can transmit

1147
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,599
15 miles and things like that that i can

1148
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,280
have clutch to my waist obviously it's

1149
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,200
trust me on a different band but you can

1150
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,880
get a handheld device that 15 miles

1151
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,640
which you can perfectly legitimately and

1152
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,560
legally carry

1153
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,240
and you could be anywhere in that area

1154
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,960
definitely i mean you could purchase a

1155
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,079
hundred pounds radio and and tune into

1156
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,800
the frequencies that's yeah very good

1157
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,079
point

1158
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,680
i wonder if maybe we could put everybody

1159
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,160
in the one room

1160
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,720
so i'm not maybe uh

1161
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,839
you know well i'm having to get people

1162
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,200
to talk over here just put them all in

1163
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,960
the one room so yeah you probably look

1164
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,160
at all the

1165
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,160
you know what what can you do to

1166
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,599
bat away all the risks and do your

1167
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,760
mitigation for these sort of things

1168
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,240
but i suppose it goes back to the what

1169
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,599
is it you're launching and why should i

1170
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,960
be worried about it i suppose that

1171
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,560
that's when you start to go up up the

1172
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,960
risk scale uh

1173
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,640
done a wee bit of work on the tetra

1174
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,359
system and there is

1175
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,359
there is a new contract out for it

1176
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,200
because actually the uk government sold

1177
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,599
off to a third

1178
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,760
not talk about that just now and it's

1179
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,240
coming back in i think to motorola i

1180
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,280
think

1181
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,440
and they're putting lots of buses on

1182
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,119
there to make it a lot faster there's a

1183
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,280
lot more secure as well uh

1184
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,040
which is hopefully but

1185
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,520
text itself is is one way to i suppose

1186
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,760
you would try and mitigate that risk

1187
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,680
or put everybody in the one room or have

1188
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,400
a

1189
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,079
password

1190
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,240
you know because if you went to it's my

1191
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,920
wife works in a school and if they've

1192
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,640
got a teacher if she knows there's a

1193
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,400
one of the panel come in and they're not

1194
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,319
happy about the way that their kids been

1195
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,400
taught it's uh mr jones is here

1196
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,480
when that code goes out over the radio

1197
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,079
it means somebody's having no trouble at

1198
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,280
reception

1199
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,800
so there's there's i suppose i really

1200
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,440
have a very basic way of trying to deal

1201
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,400
with lots of problems

1202
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,680
yeah and you know exploring that kind of

1203
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,839
threat actor issue too

1204
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,560
you have um an advantage of locating it

1205
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,720
in a very isolated spot of scotland

1206
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,880
where strangers showing up is going to

1207
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,880
be the talk of the town so that kind of

1208
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,200
blow your opsec pretty quickly if you

1209
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,440
know i am not russian

1210
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,280
right it's like okay sure but um i think

1211
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,440
the other thing that is interesting too

1212
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,960
is about the attack where you know you

1213
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,480
broadcast and then you move around you

1214
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,960
broadcast you move around i i don't know

1215
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,480
you and i don't know your background but

1216
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,920
that's exactly what you do in the

1217
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,680
military is you don't stay in one place

1218
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,839
after you've keyed a message otherwise

1219
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,280
there's a good chance something could be

1220
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,640
coming back at you um so that kind of

1221
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,720
tactic and whatnot would be would be

1222
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,280
quite um would be quite effective

1223
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,119
in that

1224
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,359
and just to point on everybody in the

1225
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,319
room

1226
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,480
generally you try and get as many people

1227
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,880
in the room as possible but there's

1228
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,119
there needs to be a lot of coordination

1229
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,960
with stakeholders as well

1230
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,400
um so physically not possible

1231
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,240
uh particularly kind of on the air

1232
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,359
traffic control side um where those guys

1233
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,480
are

1234
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,400
as far as pressed with

1235
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,000
for for

1236
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,920
you need to have them on the radio and

1237
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,440
you need to have them kind of physically

1238
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,720
located

1239
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,160
so i've got a friend to watch there but

1240
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,079
i suppose he would love a little sort of

1241
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,480
a job to go to eust because i because i

1242
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,599
wonder if you would do that i wonder if

1243
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,839
you were gonna be flying rockets that

1244
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,119
often off the place you might not

1245
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,559
actually think i'll bring somebody up

1246
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,280
from there and you drag up again this is

1247
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,960
where we're going from the ridiculous to

1248
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,359
the sublime because we're talking about

1249
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,359
one today talking putting up satellites

1250
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,040
or the size of wolves and now we could

1251
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,400
be putting up something that maybe the

1252
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,079
chinese or the russians don't want us to

1253
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,720
be doing so i suppose you are risk

1254
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,040
mitigation we go from nothing to

1255
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,160
everything

1256
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,160
all the way down but you are right if

1257
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,680
you go to eust

1258
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,559
and you don't have an extra finger and a

1259
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,280
squinty eye you're found out so you're

1260
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,960
all right

1261
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,880
and with your accent you would you would

1262
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,480
just be one of the brothers from across

1263
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,960
the ocean

1264
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,480
i think one of the points that i thought

1265
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,800
that just came across with the recent

1266
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,240
news like with uh insider threats um

1267
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,440
particularly with like you know with

1268
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,280
mentioning with spoofing like it's it's

1269
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,200
possible like for likes of like a

1270
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,200
chinese or russian espionage actors to

1271
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,880
come in and just settle themselves as a

1272
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,880
real employee so like that they become

1273
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,599
itself itself themselves as an insider

1274
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:20,559
threat

1275
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:21,839
that will

1276
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,599
 like the likes of what's

1277
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:24,880
happening here right now i know that

1278
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,160
we're trying to discuss

1279
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,839
um so it's important to kind of like um

1280
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,000
understand like what who like has access

1281
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,079
to what and understanding like who

1282
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,200
within

1283
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,480
like

1284
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,079
in your

1285
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,160
organization like who has access to what

1286
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,079
like what risks would be

1287
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,280
um

1288
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,880
like be brought if like they what they

1289
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,079
were like

1290
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:45,200
i suppose when you're thinking that the

1291
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,760
russians and the chinese the

1292
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,359
and again not

1293
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,800
that there is enough of a difference

1294
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,319
between us that would notice something

1295
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,240
coming specially to use they would spot

1296
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,280
an english person coming to us right

1297
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,800
the way this is going to work is that

1298
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,920
they're just going to have to find out

1299
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,760
the person who's using the most cast and

1300
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,200
electricity

1301
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,800
and that other person will go after

1302
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,240
because by the time you finish trying to

1303
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,800
pay for that you'll be blackmailed and

1304
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,040
that that's how this that how this has

1305
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,480
always happened

1306
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,839
most of the time these these third

1307
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:17,359
parties spent time trying to find the

1308
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,599
people angle trying to find out again i

1309
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,839
go back to what i said you know about

1310
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,040
mental health sexual health how can i

1311
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,440
what they'll be something about anyone

1312
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,359
of us sitting on this panel that you'll

1313
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,960
not want to

1314
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,680
tell outside and once i find that

1315
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,920
what happens next yeah i think that's

1316
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,520
the

1317
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,599
yeah and expanding on that threat

1318
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,440
landscape you know obviously security

1319
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,079
back ground checks are gonna help out by

1320
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,480
monitoring financial transactions

1321
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,839
of employees

1322
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,839
because in a lot of cases these people

1323
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,559
are doing are getting money

1324
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,200
to do that particular task as the

1325
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,200
insider threat and we see the

1326
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,119
extraordinary efforts that the united

1327
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,359
states has gone to encountering counter

1328
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,720
espionage by the every so couple months

1329
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,520
or whatever there's a doj press release

1330
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,400
on the next person that they found and i

1331
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,559
want to say that part of this whole like

1332
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,520
let's create mayhem is one threat model

1333
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,760
the other threat model is stealing the

1334
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,000
intellectual property of the experiments

1335
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,160
that are going on there right because as

1336
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,000
you said it's very expensive to put

1337
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,920
stuff up in space

1338
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,839
weight equal gold essentially is what

1339
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,119
you said

1340
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,000
and so i can imagine i could advance my

1341
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,880
missile program or my rocket program

1342
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,880
by not making those expenses but

1343
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,119
stealing all your data

1344
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,400
and how you're going to steal it you're

1345
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,520
going to steal it from a person you're

1346
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,359
going to pay them lots of money because

1347
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:44,720
there's something happening in their

1348
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,400
life that you know

1349
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,680
you can do as well one of one of the

1350
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,680
things that's again given clear advice

1351
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,359
out to people of you know going through

1352
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,119
university is if you ever get hired by a

1353
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,040
software company and they don't do a

1354
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,880
police check on you

1355
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,480
don't work for them

1356
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,480
because it's amazing when i when i'm

1357
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,920
doing my sort of governance piece you

1358
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,400
know i talk about you know how do you

1359
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,520
what do you do when people leave your

1360
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,920
organization the security side what do

1361
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,760
you do when people join and if you're

1362
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,920
not having to fill about paper and says

1363
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,599
you're quite happy to be secured to

1364
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,200
checked out and then in the uk it's a

1365
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,160
fairly common well well thought out

1366
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,440
decent way to just assure uh because a

1367
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,800
few are you know because the company

1368
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,160
anderson consultancy for just now

1369
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,599
they're a health company you don't want

1370
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:26,640
people

1371
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,160
you know who've got some dubious

1372
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,480
backgrounds involved and been able to

1373
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,480
take any one of our sort of data there

1374
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,760
as well so

1375
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,119
yeah let's

1376
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,119
up was checked on in fact go work go

1377
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:38,800
with one

1378
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,280
just on that the the technology that's

1379
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,720
um

1380
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,119
developed through this is controlled

1381
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,000
through an agreement called mtcr which

1382
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,800
is the missile technology control regime

1383
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,640
um and there's some with qualcomm as

1384
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,520
well which is kind of agreements around

1385
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,400
um

1386
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,240
intercontinental ballistic missile

1387
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,359
technology

1388
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:03,200
um is the same kind of stuff for um if

1389
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,119
you've got like a 50 kilometer um

1390
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,200
rocket there's there's technology within

1391
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,520
that that could be used for very

1392
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,760
nefarious purposes it's a very kind of

1393
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,040
good point about controlling controlling

1394
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,359
your staff controlling the the days

1395
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:21,520
flows internally and who has access to

1396
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,440
what but it just seems to be an i'm

1397
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,880
putting outside of this it just seems

1398
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,920
that

1399
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,599
for an industry has been on the go for

1400
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:28,960
30 years

1401
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,440
and not to have the belly basic stuff

1402
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,280
governance so like if you imagine i

1403
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,800
should i think there should be an iso to

1404
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,520
cover devices that are going into space

1405
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,440
as much as other medical devices and

1406
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,720
then there should be

1407
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,200
all sorts of governance as you start to

1408
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,520
go step up the importance from that loaf

1409
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,200
of bread right up to the thing that

1410
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,000
could

1411
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,440
be helping the ukrainians just now

1412
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,880
because we all know that elon musk has

1413
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,480
turned over some of his efforts to doing

1414
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,319
that as well so

1415
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,000
that that's the bit you've done a good

1416
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,079
job of scaring me today so thanks very

1417
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,359
much for that i'm going to go home and

1418
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,920
hope i'm gonna i know how to go home

1419
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,599
because i've been there before so let's

1420
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:04,800
hope i can go to somebody else after

1421
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,640
that hopefully the gps will work yes

1422
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,598
that five minutes yeah

1423
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,880
but um one of the things is that the

1424
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,599
people driving the industry forwards are

1425
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,880
new entrants to to the sector uh people

1426
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,599
developing the the launch vehicles the

1427
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,079
satellites that are kind of the drivers

1428
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:28,559
of growth at the moment are

1429
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,240
the people at glasgow university that

1430
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,760
are developing cubesats and reuniver

1431
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,920
napier's not got one yet but hopefully

1432
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,640
it will soon um but it's it's new

1433
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,480
entrants that are kind of driving this

1434
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,040
forward and that's probably why there's

1435
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,480
a growing problem as well

1436
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,920
i'm just going to go back to that one

1437
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,599
thing now because there's

1438
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:50,960
very interesting

1439
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,000
within the cia is a department that is

1440
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,920
specifically tasked with non-pro

1441
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,119
proliferation i.e of nuclear and

1442
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,920
ballistic missile technology um i'm not

1443
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,079
going to comment on how well their job

1444
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,240
is going because you know everyone seems

1445
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,280
to now have a rocket of some sort to put

1446
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,880
something on um but um this is carefully

1447
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,000
tracked this this is not like you don't

1448
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,559
start a rocket range because canada had

1449
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,720
one up in the north uh in churchill

1450
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,680
again very small community um but at the

1451
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,079
same time you know we're taking um

1452
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,000
really important intellectual property

1453
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,920
and we're putting it in kazakhstan to

1454
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,599
launch it right

1455
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:32,400
so

1456
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,280
so you know i i would say that the the

1457
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,319
um work that the cia does in

1458
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:39,280
non-proliferation is the kind of work

1459
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,200
that doesn't make the headlines but

1460
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,079
people tend to have accidents like a lot

1461
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,280
of iranian scientists have in the last

1462
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,079
15 years or so

1463
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,319
that's a good point and um

1464
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:53,760
it's yeah it's interesting there's a lot

1465
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,760
of canadians coming to to scotland to

1466
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,400
launch things in future hopefully

1467
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,480
um i was wondering if any of you guys

1468
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:06,200
had a kind of final last word point

1469
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:10,160
i mean i'm i'm highly unqualified to be

1470
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,960
on this panel but i still enjoyed

1471
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,880
i've i've really enjoyed and learned a

1472
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,480
lot just just from being being here

1473
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,839
today so yeah thanks a lot for having me

1474
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:28,079
[Applause]

1475
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,160
hopefully too you don't have too much

1476
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,200
problem sleeping after that
