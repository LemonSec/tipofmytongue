1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:04,880
i'll come back to why the dog's

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,759
important in a moment

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,440
does anybody not know what who ibm is

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,080
yeah okay thank you very much yeah well

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,519
ten years ago i don't think we're doing

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,680
a problem but now it probably is because

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,279
we don't make laptops anymore we don't

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,279
make computers anymore that people see

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,279
on a day-to-day basis

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,960
but we're a big enterprise technology

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,960
company we do a lot of security stuff

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,880
um we've just got about a quarter of a

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,720
million people work for us around the

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,679
world

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,840
and we are number one in a whole variety

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,480
of number of areas including patents you

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,800
know we found more patents last year

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,879
than anybody else for the 29th

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,280
consecutive year and i've been in ibm

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,520
for slightly longer than that which is a

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,360
bit scary

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,120
and i've been around in ibm

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,760
since the 90s um which is when we made

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,640
the largest ever corporate loss in

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,719
human history um

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,600
uh

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,520
but it's been fun since then and some of

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,440
the things i guess up there from a from

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,438
a security point of view there may be of

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,400
interest

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,280
um

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,080
i engineered a national identity card

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,920
system

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,520
and

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,759
and we actually found

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,920
significant numbers of terrorists as a

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,400
result of that by fusing the identities

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,280
that was interesting

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,400
i also was responsible for

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,880
a new capability

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,240
to enable

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,840
some of our

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
organizations in the uk

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
to work

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,880
low side

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,360
on the cloud so they can do

47
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,880
fast development on amazon or azure or

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,200
or ibm cloud

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,640
and then actually

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
escalate those

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,799
capabilities to the high side and do

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,399
that in an efficient manner

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,759
so

54
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,000
it's been an interesting kind of ride

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,079
and i find myself over here now

56
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,119
in a cloud architect role

57
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,439
actually trying to build

58
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,720
robust capabilities regulatory clouds

59
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,479
for the banks to start moving their

60
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,599
sensitive data to the cloud it may feel

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,599
like the cloud is everywhere these days

62
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,120
but in fact in the highly regulated

63
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,440
spaces almost nowhere you know systems

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
engagement have gone across twenty

65
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,920
percent of the systems that's about it

66
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,800
so i'm working with you know fibs 140

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,800
uh two level four kind of hsms tying

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,920
those into

69
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
confidential enclaves where you know

70
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,519
it's not just the uh the disc and the uh

71
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,040
and the keys that are encrypted but it's

72
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,000
also the uh the memory itself

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,360
and the like

74
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,000
and and the reason the dog's important

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,480
is because the dog keeps me grounded

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
okay it's when you get to being a chief

77
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,720
architect or a cto or some of these

78
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,400
wonderful titles

79
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,760
it's so easy to lose track of technology

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,200
and i was listening to some of the talks

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,280
just before this one and i was thinking

82
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,519
i actually know how to do that and the

83
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,680
only reason i know how to do that is

84
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,080
because of the work on the dog um my

85
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,800
robot dog is right from day one on in

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,480
back in 2017 was able to follow me

87
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,239
around he followed me around because i

88
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,760
held a ultrasonic screwdriver okay and

89
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,400
then the ultrasonic receivers here would

90
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,239
actually pick up where it was fitted

91
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,480
into a neural net in a javascript

92
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,280
microcontroller called an esperino um

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,720
and that would then allow him to follow

94
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,360
me so i trained him i literally trained

95
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,480
him to follow me um he had a microphone

96
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,040
no so he could talk to him um and he had

97
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,920
rotating lidar on his ears these

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,280
the whole point of this dog by the way

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,400
is also to go into schools and

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
universities and versus other places and

101
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,400
shame off um

102
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,920
he has to be built out of custer of

103
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,120
commodity parts so i've got a

104
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,200
self-written rule every bit has to be

105
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,439
less than 100 pounds okay otherwise i'm

106
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,959
not allowed to use it so i'm not allowed

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,360
to use technology to create a real robot

108
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,080
dog i have to use my ingenuity and wit

109
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,560
to try and do it instead so revolving

110
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,400
lidars on the ears with the servos that

111
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,000
are hidden underneath his head allowed

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,439
him to scan what was in front of him and

113
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,840
do some basic collision detection

114
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,000
and oops

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,840
and today he's a little bit more

116
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,760
sophisticated as the technology's got

117
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,160
cheaper in the intervening five years

118
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,320
we've now got face recognition built

119
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,560
into the raspberry pi high quality

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,800
camera i'm using a

121
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,680
coral tpu from from google

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,199
i've got a three-dimensional camera

123
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,360
generating information on the front

124
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,320
there

125
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
so that partially replaces the lidar

126
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
revolving ears but it's a bit more

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
sophisticated than that and i've also

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,840
got i've replaced the phone charging

129
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,000
point that was on the back uh now with a

130
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,639
with a 360 lidar because actually that's

131
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,560
now less than 100 pounds too

132
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,800
so he's gone from being relatively

133
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,080
sophisticated i think to be quite

134
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
sophisticated but he still runs on a

135
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,520
raspberry pi with all these little

136
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,360
microcontrollers

137
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,720
and this is the thing i've been most

138
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,880
proud of recently is you know this is

139
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,240
the kind of thing that the depth camera

140
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
will produce when it's looking forward

141
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,160
um you'd be hard pushed even as a human

142
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,919
i think to spot the fact there are three

143
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,600
tin trays that he needs to avoid on the

144
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,880
floor

145
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,160
this is after i wrote my own

146
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,400
point cloud algorithms so that basically

147
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,840
we can now see there are three tins on

148
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,600
the floor that needs to avoid and it's

149
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
doing that at 10 frames a second on a

150
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,639
single

151
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,039
single processor on a raspberry pi so

152
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,320
i've got another three processors to

153
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,360
play with

154
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,600
and and that kind of stuff

155
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,080
is is is important because it keeps me

156
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,280
grounded where i'm doing all this other

157
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,360
stuff for ibm

158
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,120
and keeps me up to date

159
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,280
and again you know you many of you are

160
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,120
at the beginning of your careers i would

161
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,440
certainly recommend finding companies

162
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
that will take techies

163
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,120
and keep them as techies until they

164
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,440
become executives which is what ibm does

165
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,960
you know where the distinguished

166
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,560
engineers and fellows and ibm are full

167
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,680
executives um but we uh but we're

168
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,759
allowed to stay technical and do stay

169
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,120
technical

170
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
so

171
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
the bulk of the talk today is not about

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
robot dogs

173
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,400
it's about the future of computing and

174
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,319
in particular qubits but i want to

175
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,160
actually make sure we touch on

176
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,080
all the different aspects of where we're

177
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,960
going because we've got bits

178
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,600
we're about to have qubits and we're

179
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
really going to change the way that

180
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,520
neurons work in the near future too and

181
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,039
i think that's going to issue in an

182
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,160
entirely new era of a new kinds of

183
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,639
scientific discovery and my goodness we

184
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,479
need it and we'll go through that in a

185
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,520
second

186
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,319
let's start with neurons first

187
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,319
i mean the machine learning today

188
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,919
we've identified in the work that we've

189
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,639
done i used to be the european cto for

190
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,759
um for our cognitive services

191
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,360
and you know i was involved in huge

192
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,520
numbers of customer projects as a result

193
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,400
and this

194
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
this sentence is deliberately overloaded

195
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,120
okay but it's ai's are only as good as

196
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,960
the data we train them on yes we spend

197
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,479
80 of our time actually cleaning the

198
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,400
data before we can use them

199
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,720
but also there are about 180 biases

200
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,919
we've identified in data so far and

201
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,360
built statistical techniques to be able

202
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,280
to deal with them so

203
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,080
you know please when as you move into

204
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,520
the next phase of of cyber you know and

205
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,120
and machine learning models get more and

206
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,520
more important just bear that statement

207
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,240
in mind it's really important

208
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,479
ibm has been involved in artificial

209
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,840
intelligence machine learning right from

210
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,319
the start well not quite from the start

211
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,639
um you know we weren't quite involved in

212
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,440
this stage um i mean people don't

213
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,720
realize that there were actually robots

214
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,960
around in the 1940s um

215
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
uh the guy who win uh walter grey world

216
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,639
said what's great walter yeah walter

217
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,400
grey walter

218
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,720
who invented the i discovered the sleep

219
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,560
patterns of humans you know

220
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,759
um actually created two robots called uh

221
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,440
elmer and elsie i think they were called

222
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,160
were built on vacuum tubes um took in

223
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,080
light amplified it through the vacuum

224
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,160
tube got it to the

225
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,240
to the to the to the motors and allowed

226
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,280
them to chase each other around the

227
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,120
floor in the 1940s

228
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,960
um but ai wasn't really born until 1956

229
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,080
um at the dartmouth conference

230
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,520
and

231
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,599
the reason i'm telling you this story

232
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,560
about

233
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,960
uh about the history i think will come

234
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,800
apparent as i go through it because

235
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,599
basically that story has been a story

236
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,680
it's unusual in technology terms of

237
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,960
these winters

238
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,039
yeah where basically nothing much

239
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,520
happened now my hypothesis when you look

240
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,879
at that was actually going on in these

241
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,639
stages is that we actually hit

242
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,320
technology dead ends

243
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,000
we stopped making progress we couldn't

244
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,039
make commercial use of the technology we

245
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,159
had

246
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,000
simply because the actual power of the

247
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,880
computers weren't able to actually

248
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,839
uh keep up with um the problems that we

249
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,120
were setting in in the real world

250
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,920
and that very first conference

251
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,680
people realized well people you know

252
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,200
know the people like john mccarthy and

253
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,640
marv minsky and claude shannon were

254
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,080
there they probably don't know there

255
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
were three ibm's there actually at the

256
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,000
same conference in nathalia rochester

257
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,040
was actually one of the ones who

258
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,240
organized the conference in the first

259
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,640
place you can see the wonderful hubris

260
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,440
of man and i do mean man man by saying

261
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,279
that basically we think within six

262
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,080
months over the summer we can crack this

263
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,160
well done i mean there's some big braves

264
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,360
there but i think that was still a bit

265
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
of a slight overcall

266
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,399
um

267
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,080
but you know the kind of people that are

268
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,160
here are quite extraordinary so

269
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,240
tenshardmore invented a program language

270
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,640
called apl um apl is the only language

271
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,240
written in greek literally written in

272
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,680
greek um

273
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,760
using greek characters uh if you want to

274
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,200
use it you have to build your own

275
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,680
keyboard these days um nathaniel

276
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,320
rochester um he invented and was the

277
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,120
main brains behind the ibm 701 which was

278
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
the world's first commercial computer

279
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,800
entirely you know built around valves

280
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,399
and everything else but the world's

281
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,839
first commission if you've ever heard

282
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,920
the thomas j watson quote when everybody

283
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,279
laughs and says there's a market out

284
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,720
there for five computers in the world

285
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,920
haha

286
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,839
that's actually a misquote what he was

287
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,600
actually saying was

288
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,920
only five computers can be afforded you

289
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,760
know there was only five companies in

290
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,040
the world that could potentially afford

291
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,240
the computers that were selling back

292
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,880
then he was wrong we sold 11.

293
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
um

294
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,680
but but my hero on oh by the way

295
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,360
nathalie rochester also invented the

296
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,720
first symbolic assembler

297
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
this bloke over here though completely

298
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,200
unsung hero arthur samuel

299
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,240
what he did was he invented well he did

300
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,519
one of the first implementations of the

301
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,200
hash table yeah

302
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,959
but also

303
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,440
hard to believe i know but basically bob

304
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,800
minsky who came with the idea of the

305
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,000
neural net

306
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,519
worked with this lot

307
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,360
and actually the year after this

308
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,760
conference we ran the very first neural

309
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,120
net

310
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,279
in 1957.

311
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,640
so nothing new under the sun arthur

312
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,160
samuel um invented a checkers playing

313
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,000
program drafts

314
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,920
um when it was announced that we had a

315
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,680
drafts playing program ibm's stock price

316
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,920
went up 15 overnight which would do that

317
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,959
these days

318
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,160
um

319
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,839
but fundamentally our samuel invented a

320
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,959
whole bunch of things which you're gonna

321
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,880
hear about again in a few seconds he

322
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,360
invented the the uh the alpha beta

323
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,279
pruning tree you know how you how you

324
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,440
get confused to play games the mid-match

325
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,040
strategy to enable um to win um he also

326
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,959
invented something called rote learning

327
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,800
um where basically he realized he

328
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,240
couldn't get the parameters quite right

329
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,000
for the waiting for the various

330
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,680
different positions on the board and how

331
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,320
much a king was worth and how much a a

332
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,920
piece was worth when it was too off the

333
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,399
end piece before it gets promoted

334
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,440
so we actually used rote learning to

335
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
tune the algorithms

336
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,519
that were actually used to tune uh how

337
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,800
much pieces were

338
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,040
were worth and evaluating the position

339
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,600
of the overall board and if obviously

340
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,360
fed in the the the information from the

341
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,079
from the best games around

342
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,720
which then gives you too deep blue

343
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,639
and deep blue is interesting because

344
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,560
basically it's got this reputation that

345
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,959
it beat casper off because of brute

346
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,040
force and to some degree that is

347
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,639
actually true

348
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,639
but it's not the whole story

349
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,000
actually

350
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,040
again all those algorithms and all the

351
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,880
weightings in the algorithms and all the

352
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,720
scores of the different stages

353
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,440
were entirely learned from human grand

354
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,040
master games

355
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,720
so

356
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,600
what

357
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,360
the reason that deep blue came about

358
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,639
when it came about in 1997 was because

359
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,920
we then had

360
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,800
mainframe kind of technology for unix

361
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,880
so we just invented sort of

362
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,680
big

363
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,519
multi-processor unix systems so again

364
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,920
the big steps in machine learning come

365
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,959
about because of the big steps in in in

366
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,920
in technology advancement um stanley the

367
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,880
darp channel challenge um not that well

368
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,040
known but stanley drove

369
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,480
172 miles i think through the desert

370
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,920
something like that

371
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,360
with only waypoints every every 50 to 70

372
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,079
meters there were gps waypoints

373
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,680
um he's got exactly the same

374
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,959
architecture as my robot um funny that

375
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,639
all robots have virtually the same

376
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,720
architecture i find

377
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,760
because we're trying to solve very

378
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,600
similar problems but again when they

379
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
tried to get stanley to drive

380
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,880
they couldn't actually come up with the

381
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,800
algorithms to get standard drive so they

382
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,200
had to put a driver in the car

383
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,600
get all this data to be absorbed and fed

384
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,760
in so they could actually generate the

385
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,120
machine learning model which would then

386
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,720
eventually drive the car because it was

387
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,240
vaping how a human drove it because

388
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,279
there was no way of actually building

389
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,279
the algorithms again that was only

390
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,680
possible because the technology had got

391
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,360
another another step in terms of what we

392
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,760
could do with portable technology and

393
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,519
then you get to watson and jeopardy

394
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,440
jeopardy big quiz game in the states

395
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
watson won against the best human

396
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,800
competences every

397
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,120
any of any all time

398
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,480
and basically that's a standalone

399
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,519
computer

400
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,040
okay so it was

401
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,639
working by itself

402
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,000
and the reason it worked and one was

403
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,079
because it was able to to sort out clues

404
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,839
like this what's the answer to this clue

405
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,120
god someone shout out someone be brave

406
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,040
no

407
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,880
yeah what is the tardis

408
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,120
if you put that into google it will not

409
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,800
appear in as targeted artists will not

410
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,000
appear on the first page or the second

411
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,320
page of the results

412
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,560
that's why watson and google are

413
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,440
different

414
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,760
google uses you know higher dimension

415
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,839
algorithms and hilbert spaces to find

416
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,760
correlations between the phrases and and

417
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,519
the documents that you're looking for

418
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,480
this actually dis dissects the

419
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,079
meaning of the sentence into those

420
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,920
various different bits so british tv

421
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,519
icons know where i'm looking time

422
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,639
machine right that's the answer it's a

423
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,399
time machine first appeared oh whack i'm

424
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,839
going to do some maths

425
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,680
around dates the day after definitely

426
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,519
having to do some dates jfk was shot

427
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,360
jeff it was shot 22 november 963 um 23rd

428
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,040
what happened on then oh yeah doctor who

429
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,320
started what was the name of the time

430
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
machine the tardis so

431
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,399
what you know watson gets that one right

432
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,160
the only reason that we're not using

433
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,639
watson as the world search engine is

434
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,320
because to do that you need an entire

435
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,720
dedicated supercomputer um that only

436
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,199
works over the cloud

437
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,959
you know you can see there 3000

438
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,120
processor threads 16 terabytes of ram

439
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,720
and the latest technologies that are

440
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,160
available those times sparkle and hadoop

441
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,040
which may seem old hat these days

442
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,160
but um but it's what we had then

443
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,440
so

444
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,920
technology is driving the problems we

445
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,959
can solve

446
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,720
which is why when you get to google and

447
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,680
alphago zero where basically the system

448
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,360
taught itself to be the world's best um

449
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,399
player

450
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,480
of gay of go

451
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,560
amazingly you see exactly the same

452
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,240
architecture that arthur samuel invented

453
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,959
in the 1950s you know we have the

454
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,519
overall holistic board evaluator thing

455
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,680
that he used rote learning for you have

456
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,759
the individual expert policies for the

457
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,279
individual games

458
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,920
rather than doing a alpha beta search is

459
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,360
now doing the multi-car loads research

460
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,199
because it's got to go wider and deeper

461
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,720
uh and and goes less predictable um but

462
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,560
and but the whole thing about the min

463
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,920
max strategy and the propagation of

464
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,000
schools is still there the actual things

465
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,240
playing almost the same way that

466
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,600
actually that checkers program was

467
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,839
playing in the 1950s but now everything

468
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,639
is driven through a neural net

469
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,560
and then we get to today where we've got

470
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,800
things like gpt-3

471
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,720
and project a beta project base you

472
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,240
probably haven't heard of because it

473
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,120
lost

474
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,040
this is a computer that does oxford

475
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,000
debates

476
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,880
okay

477
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,440
and it does up for debates by ingesting

478
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,079
a corpus been given a subject to argue

479
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,839
one it will assemble its own argument it

480
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,320
will now speak its own argument

481
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,759
the human then responds okay it listens

482
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,959
to the human

483
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,519
transcribes what the human says and then

484
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,279
generates a rebuttal

485
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,800
to that argument

486
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,519
and then basically you you have the full

487
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,639
debate

488
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,639
now the reason no one's ever heard of

489
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,120
this is because i said unlike deep blue

490
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,399
and unlike jeopardy and everything else

491
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,199
we lost this one why because the human

492
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,000
used emotion to sway the audience

493
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,439
because the success of an oxford debate

494
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,880
is how many people you change the mind

495
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,839
of

496
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,959
so

497
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,039
it's a bit like spock going against

498
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,439
captain kirk you know spock is unlikely

499
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,599
to win the argument for a big audience

500
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,799
because captain cope will know how to

501
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,480
manipulate the audience but this is

502
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,520
important in a in a world of of deep

503
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,079
fakes and and and manipulation through

504
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,400
social media algorithms and you know

505
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,440
implying hate by by feeding back uh the

506
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,280
information that you will reinforce your

507
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,880
own point of view and putting into a

508
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,400
small echo cave

509
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,000
we think this is the kind of technology

510
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,520
that could could

511
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,200
go against that because it will show you

512
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,919
both sides of the argument logically etc

513
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,679
now how you do that ethically we don't

514
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,919
know that's up for debate but that's

515
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,200
where the technology is going

516
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,240
but that's got a really bad downside so

517
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,880
as i said every single time we get to a

518
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,720
new inflection point of the technology

519
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,400
we open up new problems

520
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,760
but this is the problem we've got at the

521
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,039
moment

522
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,360
uh logarithmic graphs yeah

523
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,160
so basically um we're doubling the

524
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,200
amount of power we use for ai

525
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,919
training every three and a half months

526
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,600
so i don't know about you but i really

527
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,120
don't want to burn the planet

528
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,600
um so we've got to find a way forward

529
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,760
and not this includes gpus and tpus and

530
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,200
everything else so

531
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,640
one thing is neuromorphic technology um

532
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,480
this is an old chart now but you know

533
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
even if you updated it all the all the

534
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,840
current pro

535
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,400
systems would be clustered around here

536
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,919
where do you think the human brain is on

537
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,080
that chart so this is clock frequency

538
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,559
and power density

539
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,919
up here

540
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,840
off the chart somewhere on the wall

541
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,039
ceiling so worth sailing afraid not

542
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,679
the human brain works at a really low

543
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,640
clock speed yeah and uses almost no

544
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,840
power

545
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,160
so wouldn't it be a cool idea if you

546
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,679
actually had some chips that work that

547
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,679
way and we've been designing those and

548
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,880
you know they're beginning to get to the

549
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,960
point where in maybe five or ten years

550
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,960
they might be commercially viable

551
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
um but this is used by the military

552
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,840
primarily um so on the right here we've

553
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,799
got an fpga yeah which is basically

554
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,960
shoveling video data at the chip on the

555
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,760
left

556
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,520
called true north chip

557
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,280
that chip this is a thermal image

558
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,799
obviously

559
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,320
is basically doing two and a half

560
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,960
thousand frames of video processing and

561
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,400
picking out the people

562
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,840
and the vehicles

563
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,799
and the

564
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,720
cyclists and everything else and it's

565
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,640
doing that at 40 milliwatts

566
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,520
okay

567
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,679
so you can imagine you start scaling

568
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,600
that pro that that

569
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,840
that capability is amazing and because

570
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,440
the clock speed is so low you can

571
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
actually have huge wafers doing this and

572
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,640
you can string the wafers together from

573
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,559
the super computer which we have and

574
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,080
we've managed to create a supercomputer

575
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,720
that uses about the same power as a

576
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,080
human brain

577
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,960
um

578
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,919
with the with the number of neurons and

579
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,039
of a mole

580
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,799
okay so that's

581
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,000
not bad at least we're in mammal

582
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,400
territory it's it's you know but but

583
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,840
that's one of the ways things are going

584
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,600
to go and the other way that's more

585
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,679
immediate you know many of you will use

586
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,640
gpus for all kinds of reasons i'm sure

587
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,799
um as well as playing games um but tpus

588
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,799
and the right and the other and the

589
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,000
other related technologies are coming

590
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
through and what we've found is that

591
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,039
actually we can reduce the precision of

592
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,440
the chips that we use

593
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,400
um to execute the deep neural nets to

594
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,320
actually make them in massively more

595
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,159
efficient okay without actually

596
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,880
sacrificing much in the way of accuracy

597
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,559
so what you're going to see

598
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,799
in is is basically this reduced

599
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,039
precision digital which may go down as

600
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,159
far as you know two digits you know

601
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,919
two bits um

602
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,240
and and ultimately we think it's going

603
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,480
to end up with analog type chips

604
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,679
so

605
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,840
as that goes through into 2026 and

606
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,159
beyond you know just think of all those

607
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,600
different steps i just showed you in the

608
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,760
path to ai and machine learning you know

609
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,159
i think the agi

610
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,880
path is is opening up again because if

611
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,799
we can make it this efficient

612
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,039
then we're not burning the planet in

613
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,919
addition things like the the watson

614
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,000
um i didn't go through how the watson

615
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,840
jeopardy thing actually worked but the

616
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,679
point is that it basically had huge

617
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,679
numbers of algorithms and depending on

618
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,200
the context it was choosing different

619
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,880
algorithms to answer which question and

620
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,720
that's what it learned it had learned

621
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
which algorithm works in which context

622
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,000
and i think that model that we're going

623
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,480
to see much more of as we get into this

624
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,440
stage of of multi-machine learning

625
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,679
and bits i won't spend very long time on

626
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,880
bits because i don't have much time at

627
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,559
all anyway um

628
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,039
but the cool thing about bits

629
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,159
is

630
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,240
moore's law is kind of dead

631
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,640
well it is dead it's finished it's gone

632
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,480
you know the idea that processing power

633
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,039
and power density would double every 18

634
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,520
months and you've got this ever yeah

635
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,919
exponential curve of of glorious

636
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,640
capability coming forward it's finished

637
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,960
it's gone why well because actually

638
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,240
we're kind of running out of atoms um

639
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,159
basically the the current chips are now

640
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,840
getting the size where they're so small

641
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,520
that quantum effects are now beginning

642
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,760
to dominate so you have to redesign how

643
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,640
gates work fundamentally to do that but

644
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,440
um late last year um

645
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,480
i think was late last year it might be

646
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,080
early this year we announced two

647
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,559
nanometer chips so today's technology is

648
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,400
about five to seven nanometers

649
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,200
um

650
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,280
so you'll see that the density is about

651
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,679
90 to 170 transistors per millimeter

652
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,200
squared

653
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,679
stuff that's amazing um but then i grew

654
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,120
up with machines that were in the

655
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,679
megahertz not the gigahertz and you know

656
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,720
and the rest

657
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,760
um you know now we are looking at you

658
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,600
know this kind of thing

659
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,159
24 atoms for a gate and and now

660
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,919
3d chip chips are now increasingly 3d

661
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,760
arranged so that they can get the

662
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,720
density um without having to go down to

663
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,799
so small that things get compromised by

664
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,240
the quantum effects

665
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,159
um the end result for the end user of

666
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,400
this kind of technology you know we're

667
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,039
still looking at things like either 75

668
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,400
power savings doing the same kind of

669
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,320
work as today which is good news for

670
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,600
phones i guess um or you know 45 power

671
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,919
improvement but you'll see but that's

672
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,760
going to be in five years time

673
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,280
yeah because that's how long it will

674
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,039
take to get from the basic fab to the

675
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,520
device or thereabouts so you can see

676
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,200
that moore's law genuinely has slowed

677
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,400
down

678
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,320
and you know so even the world's second

679
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,840
most powerful computer which again is

680
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
one of ours you know

681
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,919
is not going to solve all the world's

682
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,200
problems

683
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,360
and that's where we think qubits come in

684
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,640
okay

685
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,720
because qubits give us the ability to go

686
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,600
into a whole bunch of new problems and

687
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,880
new problem spaces that actually science

688
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,559
and technology haven't even scratched

689
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,080
the surface of

690
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,440
so what are

691
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,200
qubits well you know i was i was

692
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,120
inducted into this space about five

693
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,520
years ago now um by going off to the

694
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,200
labs and seeing everything and being you

695
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,240
know taught how they worked and

696
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,799
everything else and shown them um and

697
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,480
back then it really did feel like this

698
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,720
is where we were you know colossus and

699
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,279
you know 1944 and all that kind of stuff

700
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,760
um i'm not saying we're not but we've

701
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,840
come an awful lot way in in the last

702
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,039
five years

703
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,559
um but we're still right at the

704
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,320
beginning of this yeah

705
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,400
but we are looking at us

706
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,039
as a capability you know moore's law

707
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,120
coming to its end we're now seeing

708
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,640
something that is actually going well

709
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,960
beyond moore's law in terms of how fast

710
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,200
we're making progress with the

711
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,159
technology um

712
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,720
and you know sorry quantum volume is a

713
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,640
measure qv is a measure of how fast

714
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,880
quantum computers are and and you can

715
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,200
see that it's it's going forward at a

716
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
quite a race of knots here's me showing

717
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,799
off in front of a budget but a bunch of

718
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,720
journalists on monday i think this

719
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,279
monday might be on tuesday this week

720
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,159
um

721
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,080
basically the thing that is crucial to

722
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,840
know about quantum computers is that's

723
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,080
the chip there okay that tiny little

724
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
thing at the bottom postage stamp size

725
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,960
is the chip all of this is just there to

726
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,320
keep it cold

727
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,880
so at the top of the device it's about

728
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,960
four kelvin yeah

729
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,559
at the bottom of the device down here

730
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,080
but it's cooled down takes 24 hours to

731
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,559
cool down it's about

732
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,559
14 millikelvin

733
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,600
okay

734
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,320
so

735
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,880
significantly colder than outer space

736
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,600
about as cold as outer space

737
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,559
um

738
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,400
and it needs to be that cold to keep the

739
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,120
qubits coherent at the moment you know

740
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,960
the only way to get a quantum computer

741
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,720
to work is to keep these things under

742
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,840
control

743
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,799
um on a supercomputer one uh sorry on a

744
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,960
super cooled one and basically

745
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,360
at the moment we're about 600 micro

746
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,840
seconds of cons of coherency before it

747
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,679
all falls apart through to external

748
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,720
factors

749
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,480
i mean we're you know i think i think

750
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
we'll get to about a millisecond once we

751
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,000
get to a millisecond that's when we'll

752
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,400
get the ability to do things that on a

753
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,919
quantum computer that you know you can't

754
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,000
do anywhere else

755
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,240
and the way it works at

756
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,960
the chip level is pretty extraordinary i

757
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,559
mean you remember i've just shown you a

758
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,159
two nanometer

759
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,559
gate type of technology yeah

760
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,000
look at the size of this josephine

761
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,400
junction 100 nanometers

762
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,760
the chip technology that we're using

763
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,720
kind of to do this is almost ancient

764
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,159
yeah because we're actually at that

765
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,840
stage where we're you know we're

766
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,200
actually using things that you can see

767
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,679
with the human eye and what's all you do

768
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,120
with the quantum computer in assessments

769
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,840
is is feeding in microwave signals to

770
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,520
manipulate the qubits

771
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,600
and then basically reading signals back

772
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,200
out and all those layers in the

773
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,840
chandelier that i showed you are all

774
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,440
basically attenuation layers to make the

775
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,080
signals less powerful as they come in

776
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,760
and then amplify them as they come out

777
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,039
so you can actually see what's going on

778
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,120
in the machine

779
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,640
and this is what quantum computer now

780
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,799
looks like they're rather cool i think

781
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,039
and the system too looks even better

782
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,679
it's really nice but even that designed

783
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,880
by the same people who designed things

784
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,799
for ferrari i think it was

785
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,919
um

786
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,120
but there's a

787
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,200
there's an amazing

788
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,720
for those of you some of you might know

789
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,320
ibm um but ibm never does this okay this

790
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,880
is a three-year quantum roadmap that we

791
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,840
published and we are sticking to we

792
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,000
never you know in research we never

793
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,919
stick out you know

794
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,440
road maps or everybody else and the

795
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,400
reason we've done this is because

796
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,720
there's so much snake oil in the in the

797
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
quantum industry that we felt that we

798
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,200
had to you know show what we were doing

799
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,440
and be very open about it so you know

800
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,039
this is where we currently are with with

801
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,360
127 cubic machine

802
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,279
um and as you can see what we're going

803
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,880
to go what we're going to move forward

804
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,000
into very quickly next year is is over a

805
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,520
thousand qubits

806
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,919
and we'll also at that point have the

807
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,720
ability to essentially interact

808
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,679
with the quantum machine using

809
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,520
normal

810
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,080
python libraries generally yeah

811
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,919
using a serverless architecture today if

812
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,600
you play with the quantum computers in

813
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,520
ibm and you can play them for free by

814
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,679
the way just log on and you can play

815
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:58,559
with them

816
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,039
and learn how they work

817
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,200
it's a kind of batch mode orientation

818
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,720
you know you you create your circuit you

819
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,480
define your circuit you send it off it

820
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,080
runs a hundred thousand times comes back

821
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,240
whatever yeah um

822
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,840
in this kind of time frame we think

823
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,960
we're going to have

824
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,440
the big chips and serverless type

825
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
architecture on the cloud why is that

826
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,360
important well we think that that

827
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,240
combination of fast turnaround

828
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,000
interactive circuits that are both

829
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,960
conventional and quantum

830
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
and that number of qubits which allows

831
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,919
us to do error correction on the machine

832
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,360
and we'll be enough to get to quantum

833
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,919
advantage okay so we will be able to to

834
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,520
build algorithms that

835
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,679
you know no supercomputer no matter how

836
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,080
big in the world would ever be able to

837
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,279
execute okay and we think we probably

838
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,080
will get there we don't know we hope

839
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,000
next year

840
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,440
and that's real world problems not just

841
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,000
something theoretical made up

842
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,279
so what is a qubit what is what does it

843
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,120
look like when you try and program a

844
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,799
qubit well a qubit is actually

845
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,080
this thing on that

846
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,000
it could be either zero state or one

847
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,240
state when it's measured but before it's

848
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,200
measured

849
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,360
it can actually have a value anywhere on

850
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,200
the surface of this sphere if it's in a

851
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,720
coherent state

852
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,080
and if it's in a coherent state then

853
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,760
your quantum computer is working if it's

854
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,679
not a coherent state it may well have a

855
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,600
state inside the sphere inside the block

856
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,840
sphere okay but while it's working

857
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,399
properly it will have a value

858
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,679
somewhere on the surface of the block

859
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,520
sphere okay and this is actually a

860
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,159
quantum program all right so a quantum

861
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,320
circuit is a set of gates similar to

862
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,159
assembly code that you'd probably well i

863
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,159
certainly use when i was a kid

864
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,520
people don't tend to use assembly code

865
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,919
anymore but never mind um but basically

866
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,520
what this this program is this is two

867
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,919
different qubits keep it zero cubic one

868
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,720
um these are c naught gates every gate

869
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,159
in quantum has to be reversible you have

870
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,480
to be able to do it both ways yeah um

871
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,799
because you can't lose information um so

872
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,120
this is a c not gate these are hadamard

873
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,840
gates that that basically flip um the

874
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,720
phase

875
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,880
of the uh of the of the uh of the

876
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,200
quantum bit under the scene art gate and

877
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,039
the hadamard another cenote gate and

878
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,039
then these are the measurements now when

879
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,559
you measure it you'll only ever get a

880
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,640
zero or one

881
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,960
but the point is that actually the value

882
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,399
that you're getting might be somewhere

883
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,279
over here so if you run that whole thing

884
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,799
lots of times you get out probably

885
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,880
distribution curve that tells you more

886
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,960
information than a single running would

887
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,399
which would just give you a zero one

888
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,880
and the difference really between you

889
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,640
know well actually i've just said that

890
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,159
yeah i just said that um so basically um

891
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,960
you know that's part of the power of a

892
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,880
quantum computer but not really the full

893
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,159
story yeah um and you get very simple

894
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,080
gates like the the x gate which

895
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,840
basically just revolves

896
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,559
the vectors from zero state to one state

897
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,399
and you do put the x on it again it will

898
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,080
go back to the top

899
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,520
very boring

900
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,640
but

901
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,919
then you get things like the hadamard

902
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,720
gate how do my gate changes essentially

903
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,679
the phase

904
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,600
so basically you start over here in the

905
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,519
zero state and you'll notice now the

906
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,519
vector's pointing to the side

907
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,360
what does that mean well what that

908
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,720
actually means is you've now just

909
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,640
invented schrodinger's cat

910
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,720
because this thing is literally half

911
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,799
dead and half alive and it's only when

912
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,320
you measure it then it comes one or the

913
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,440
other but it is genuinely in that state

914
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,120
and all the mathematics you can do and

915
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,720
all the predictions you can do around

916
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,919
the algorithms use this capability

917
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,640
of superposition to enable you to start

918
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,880
doing some clever things and the really

919
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
clever thing you can do with quantum

920
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,960
is you can entangle quantum qubits

921
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,720
together so here we are on our um 64-bit

922
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,240
hummingbird chip

923
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,640
and we are untangling qubits four and

924
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,120
411 together and what that means is when

925
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,640
they're entangled

926
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,640
basically the states

927
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,000
become

928
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,960
well before we had two two vectors yeah

929
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,200
uh sorry two a two dimensional vector

930
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,039
yeah now we've got a four dimensional

931
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,399
vector describing the individual qubit

932
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,320
because they're now entangled and you

933
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,000
can't factor it out

934
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,919
well you can sometimes if they're if

935
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,600
they're inconsistent states but

936
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,519
generally speaking when they when you

937
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,279
can't factor them out they are then

938
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,720
entangled so they're entangled

939
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,919
mathematically but they're also

940
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,760
entangled in reality and we actually do

941
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,559
that by firing a microwave pulse to both

942
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,640
of the qubits at the same time that's

943
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,240
how their joint harmonic frequency that

944
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,720
actually kind of pulls them together

945
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,440
so basically you know this state is not

946
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
entangled and why not well because we've

947
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,880
got a zero here and a zero here when we

948
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,200
could actually separate that cubit out

949
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,039
so it's only that qubit over here that's

950
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,159
in a in a in a bell kind of state

951
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,559
whereas these ones here you can't

952
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,320
actually separate them out these are now

953
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,000
entangled these two qubits are entangled

954
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,480
and why is entangling so important well

955
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,679
because

956
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,360
every time you do that entangling you

957
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,559
add those extra two dimensions onto each

958
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,799
individual qubit in the machine okay

959
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,360
that's got an inktangle qubit so you

960
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,840
know when you start with two qubits

961
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,120
you might be able to saw the equivalent

962
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,080
of 512 bits in this kind of phase memory

963
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,840
space multi-dimensional hilbert space or

964
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,919
whatever you call it yeah but by the

965
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,200
time you get down to these bigger

966
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,720
numbers and you know remember where

967
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,240
somewhere between here and here at the

968
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,200
moment

969
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,600
if you entangled all the qubits in that

970
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,640
system

971
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,399
and then use them to do some kind of

972
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,159
problem you're talking about somewhere

973
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,360
between

974
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,200
you know the equivalent of 550 gigabytes

975
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,960
worth of state or more than all the

976
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,080
atoms in the

977
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,600
earth okay

978
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,120
now

979
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,880
that's not easy to do

980
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,880
but that's exactly how the algorithms

981
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,640
work you know so

982
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,080
you probably heard about shaw's

983
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,840
algorithm yeah

984
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,840
based on grover's algorithm yeah

985
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,320
long way to go until that's a problem

986
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,000
for you know

987
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,880
2k or 4k rsa keys yeah

988
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,559
but you know

989
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,480
the the possibility still remains that

990
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,320
at some point in the future maybe it's

991
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,799
in 20 it was in 30 years

992
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,480
that actually we will be able to or

993
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,159
someone will be able to

994
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,440
execute

995
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,760
you know shaw's algorithm and and and

996
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,440
extract those keys

997
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,000
um even at those kind of key lens now

998
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
that's a bit scary and it should be

999
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,679
scary because if you're holding data now

1000
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,079
that is valuable in 20 or 30 years time

1001
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,960
that's a problem and we do have clients

1002
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,440
who are in that space okay so we've

1003
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,440
already made you know we're already

1004
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,879
going through and getting them to turn

1005
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,599
to

1006
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,199
elliptical curve cryptography and all

1007
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,839
this kind of stuff as a result

1008
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,679
but in fact

1009
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,839
no one really knows

1010
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,239
whether these new nist or iso key

1011
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,239
schemes are actually going to be secure

1012
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,839
against quantum

1013
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,079
when i started quantum five years ago i

1014
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,480
was told the travelling salesman problem

1015
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,159
was not amenable to quantum computer

1016
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,440
speed up

1017
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
we now know that it is

1018
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,159
so although we think the walk through a

1019
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,960
lattice may be perfectly fine at the

1020
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,800
moment who knows

1021
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,720
so i think another thing to think about

1022
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,560
another thing to to be talking to

1023
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,680
clients about

1024
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,760
is they're going to need to have the

1025
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,920
ability to dynamically change their key

1026
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,400
schemes in the future yeah because when

1027
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,839
somebody comes up with one of these

1028
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,160
things you know there's nothing much you

1029
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,000
can do other than switch the key scheme

1030
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,320
yeah and if that takes you months or

1031
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,280
years

1032
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,119
that's not a good place to be

1033
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,599
so i think you'll see dynamic

1034
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,680
cryptography scheme changes becoming an

1035
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,440
ever more increasing part of high

1036
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,960
security systems

1037
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,400
so what can you do with this quantum

1038
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,320
stuff you know if you entangle all these

1039
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,480
qubits into this huge amazing face space

1040
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,560
that's got all these dimensions in it

1041
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,640
you know what does that enable you to do

1042
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
well first of all

1043
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,240
the reason why quantum computers came

1044
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,359
around the first place is richard

1045
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,119
feynman basically said if you want to

1046
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,119
understand quantum systems and there's

1047
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,720
quite a lot of reasons to understand

1048
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,119
quantum systems you better actually have

1049
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,280
a quantum computer because it's the only

1050
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,440
thing that will cope with that problem

1051
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,320
yeah if you want them to model

1052
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,920
even something simple as a caffeine

1053
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,720
molecule today on a supercomputer you

1054
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,040
can't do it because the supercomputer

1055
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,240
isn't powerful enough all right so

1056
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,320
if we want to understand the real world

1057
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,800
down at the quantum level we're going to

1058
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
need those machines and i'll show why

1059
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,480
that's important in a moment

1060
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,839
in ai there's a whole pile of of of you

1061
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,079
know you can't do the kind of big data

1062
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,560
kind of mining stuff but for one shot

1063
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,200
kind of or relatively small amounts of

1064
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,119
training type machine learning models

1065
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,800
you know you can start looking at these

1066
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,280
kind of things and i've got you know on

1067
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,280
on monday we announced a

1068
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,520
a deal with hsbc you know they're gonna

1069
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,119
over the next three years are gonna

1070
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,720
build out this capability and look at

1071
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,480
some of these kind of uses

1072
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,200
um

1073
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,800
i've already you know we've already had

1074
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,440
the front page of nature once just on on

1075
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,880
our machine learning classification

1076
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,280
capability on quantum

1077
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,440
it comes back with answers

1078
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,200
for really horrible classification

1079
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,640
problems the like of which you've never

1080
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,640
seen before every other album we've got

1081
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,839
in the world is going to be very

1082
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,760
procedural you find the the local

1083
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,960
minimum you try and work out with his

1084
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,119
local miner

1085
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,480
but in quantum it just does one kind of

1086
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,800
glance across the entire entangled space

1087
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,480
but it's over there

1088
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,119
slight oversimplification but basically

1089
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,560
that's what it's doing

1090
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,280
so

1091
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,960
even the answers it comes back with to

1092
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,119
machine learning classification problems

1093
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,880
look strange they look kind of quantum

1094
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,440
and then basically the monte carlo side

1095
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,960
of things although this isn't

1096
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,480
exponential speed up like shaw's

1097
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,760
algorithm

1098
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,280
you know this is at least these are

1099
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,599
generally quadratic speed up problems so

1100
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,880
we can still

1101
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,440
it still means we can tackle stuff that

1102
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,200
the biggest supercomputer wouldn't have

1103
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,960
been able to tackle you know as soon as

1104
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,440
we get to the point of quantum advantage

1105
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,720
okay so

1106
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,520
pretty broad ranging

1107
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,040
um and if you want to play with them you

1108
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,400
know these are the quantum computers

1109
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,920
that are available at the moment uh in

1110
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,079
the last five years or so we've had 54

1111
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,920
different quantum computers on the web

1112
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,760
um for free free for people to use i

1113
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,200
think 20 of them are out there at the

1114
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,280
moment as we retire some of this kind of

1115
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,119
thing um you can go off and play with

1116
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,000
them

1117
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,160
this is uh you know so you can drill

1118
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,680
into the one and you can see what the

1119
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,280
layout of the machine is and what you

1120
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,440
can do with it this is me playing with

1121
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,200
the quantum experience generally

1122
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,160
speaking if you're trying to build

1123
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,680
anything complicated you'll write the

1124
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,480
final version in python using a library

1125
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,400
called kit but while you're trying to

1126
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,839
learn the algorithm or understand how it

1127
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,400
works i'd recommend using this kind of

1128
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,079
technique where you've actually got the

1129
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,240
musical stave notation at the top here

1130
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,079
and what you're essentially doing is you

1131
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,079
know is actually stepping through the

1132
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,440
algorithm gate by gate um and and for

1133
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,200
the you know this is this is this is

1134
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,520
grover's algorithm um i could only find

1135
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,760
online three bit versions three qubit

1136
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,280
versions of it so i wanted to write a

1137
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,880
four cubic version of it and then that

1138
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,920
would allow me to work i'd do a five

1139
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,599
keyboard version et cetera so this was

1140
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,760
me working that out and as you can see

1141
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,160
i've successfully identified the uh

1142
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,000
the the right answer by kicking it out

1143
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,079
of phase and then basically i'll put it

1144
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,240
through the amplification process over

1145
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,240
here and that's resulted in the

1146
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,079
probability of that answer coming out of

1147
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,720
the quantum computer being very close to

1148
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,200
what 80 percent is that it's pretty high

1149
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,560
but you can see that compared to all the

1150
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,839
other states and it might have been the

1151
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,560
answer it's it's pretty obvious that

1152
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,640
it's found the right answer and this is

1153
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,599
with you know noisy intermediate uh

1154
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,320
scale quantum computers you know once we

1155
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,000
get error correction in here with more

1156
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,200
qubits

1157
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,280
it'll make it even better

1158
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,320
and the other thing i'm particularly

1159
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,440
proud of ibm for doing is is making this

1160
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,480
process

1161
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,640
open so if you want to go in and look at

1162
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,760
those computers and actually find what

1163
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,640
the gate fidelity is for a c not gate on

1164
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,040
the latest eagle chip

1165
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,480
we'll actually tell you and we're

1166
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,320
literally publishing everything

1167
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,920
why are we doing that well because we

1168
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,720
think

1169
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,400
it's the only way to get this thing to

1170
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,880
work in a fast time frame so for example

1171
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,240
we published a paper um on quantum

1172
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,520
apathy quantum amplitude

1173
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,880
quantum amplitude estimation qae yeah

1174
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,640
and then basically two of our customers

1175
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,839
who are on our

1176
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,920
on a university who around our quantum

1177
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,520
network you know they get to use our

1178
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,599
machines for research purposes

1179
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,079
improve the method yeah and then jp

1180
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,280
morgan chase the bank um worked out how

1181
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,839
to apply that to options pricing

1182
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,599
the cart they can't do it quite yet they

1183
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,760
won't run quite yet um but then

1184
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,040
basically we took what they've done and

1185
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,960
put it back into quiz game which

1186
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,319
and we start again

1187
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,480
you know so this kind of open approach

1188
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,960
to research and to and to pushing the

1189
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,800
thing forward is i think is really

1190
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,960
really important and it's why i think

1191
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,599
ibm's in a very strong position

1192
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,280
not just with the hardware which is our

1193
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,440
hardware unlike many people

1194
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,520
but also with this software ecosystem

1195
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,680
that's that's really kind of building

1196
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,040
momentum

1197
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,200
and why is it important why do i care

1198
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,760
about qubits and why do i spend my time

1199
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,119
learning this stuff

1200
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,359
apart from the fact is absolutely deeply

1201
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,560
fascinating um well mostly because these

1202
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,480
are the kind of things we think we'll be

1203
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,480
able to tackle yeah

1204
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,520
so i love whipping tea side yeah sorry

1205
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,599
daniel in tea stud oh sorry about that i

1206
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,800
live down in t side um well two of the

1207
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,720
nitrogen fixation plants are for the uk

1208
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,040
we make the fertilizer for europe

1209
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,560
uh

1210
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,400
that process takes one not worldwide not

1211
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
in justin t side takes one and a half

1212
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,359
percent of the world's energy supply

1213
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,359
to make the fertilizer that keeps

1214
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,280
everybody alive because actually we

1215
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,560
can't create enough food without

1216
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,800
fertilizer without this process the

1217
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,400
harbor bosch process is incredibly

1218
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,319
inefficient it requires massive

1219
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,160
pressures and massive temperatures to

1220
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,119
work

1221
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,440
imagine if you could work out

1222
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
the enzyme that plants use to do exactly

1223
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,640
the same job

1224
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,880
and then turn that into a catalyst

1225
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,880
yeah you need to be able to model that

1226
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,640
molecule really really

1227
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,640
with massive fidelity

1228
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,160
but it's only got about 150 atoms in it

1229
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,319
which is well within the range of what's

1230
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,880
going to be we hope quantum computing in

1231
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,280
the next few years okay

1232
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,040
or even better perhaps

1233
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,319
you know

1234
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,480
the same kind of thinking can you create

1235
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,800
a catalyst for industrial use

1236
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,720
that basically takes the co2 that comes

1237
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,960
out of industrial

1238
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,720
as industrial waste

1239
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,640
and convert that into hydrocarbons using

1240
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,920
water

1241
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,040
because then you might be able to create

1242
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,400
something like methanol which would be

1243
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,920
quite nice because then you could fly

1244
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,520
planes with it

1245
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
so actually again

1246
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,079
not only does that carbon capture but it

1247
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,319
also produces a renewable fuel source

1248
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,079
potentially yeah

1249
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,240
but again you can't do that unless you

1250
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,960
understand at a deep level

1251
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,920
how the

1252
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,359
how how the molecular chemistry is

1253
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,359
working at the moment that's beyond

1254
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,680
supercomputers obviously the financial

1255
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,520
models

1256
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,599
and perhaps even new classes of

1257
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,400
antibiotics

1258
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,040
but i think just those first two were

1259
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,800
the ones that really got me interested

1260
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,079
especially that top left one because

1261
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:00,960
it's so

1262
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,440
near to my home and my heart

1263
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,720
so

1264
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,800
in summary

1265
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,319
and hopefully to give us two minutes for

1266
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,680
questions

1267
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,680
we've not run out of problems in the

1268
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,880
world we really haven't but we do think

1269
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,680
that things like analog chips and

1270
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,280
machine learning models and deep neural

1271
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,240
nets

1272
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,839
and quantum and the kind of things i've

1273
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,520
just shown you

1274
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,920
may be useful but we could genuinely use

1275
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,319
the help all right so thanks for your

1276
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,400
time any questions if we have time for

1277
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,839
questions i know i'm between you and the

1278
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,078
bar

1279
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,200
any questions

1280
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,200
please

1281
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,520
yeah so i mean things like lattice

1282
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,599
encryption this kind of thing basically

1283
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:48,640
the the

1284
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,760
the

1285
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,520
the shortest walk problem through a

1286
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,280
lattice

1287
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,119
is just something at the moment that we

1288
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,880
can't find a quantum algorithm to

1289
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,520
implement that enables us to achieve any

1290
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,920
kind of speed up of any real nature

1291
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,520
most quantum algorithms either do a

1292
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,760
quadratic or an exponential speed up

1293
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,920
trouble is rsa it's an exponential speed

1294
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,760
up um using using shaw's algorithm um

1295
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,680
and and basically the um you know the

1296
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,079
symmetric multi you know symmetric visa

1297
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,400
or quadratic speed up so not as bad

1298
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,359
but

1299
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,720
so at the moment we haven't found the

1300
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,319
equivalent algorithm

1301
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,400
for lattice-based um cryptography

1302
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,839
now

1303
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,599
do not quote me on this

1304
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,760
but i look at it and go

1305
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,800
you know and i look at things like

1306
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,079
travelling salesman problem where i was

1307
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,640
told there was no no way to and now i

1308
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,079
find that there's a quadratic speed up

1309
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,680
for it

1310
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,000
i don't know that's why i'm i'm saying

1311
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,520
to all of you

1312
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,520
think about how you create dynamic

1313
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,800
cryptographic

1314
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,400
schemes where you can swap out one

1315
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,480
scheme for another without too much

1316
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,440
hassle

1317
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,800
because i think

1318
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,560
that's where we're venturing into so in

1319
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,400
my personal opinion not ibm's opinion

1320
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,560
but that's you know

1321
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,480
you know we genuinely don't you know we

1322
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,079
hope those schemes are right we think

1323
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,720
they are but we don't actually genuinely

1324
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,680
know

1325
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,480
how can we you know

1326
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,079
yes

1327
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,440
right the reason it's called post

1328
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,319
quantum is because you know if if we get

1329
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,640
quantum advantage next year yeah that

1330
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,680
doesn't mean we're going to be able to

1331
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,760
shores algorithm at any speed size or

1332
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,920
any way yeah so it's not it's not a

1333
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,359
problem yeah

1334
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,119
but but in 30 years time it would be a

1335
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,119
problem so you've got to have post

1336
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,200
quantum cryptography now

1337
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,280
to protect the secrets

1338
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,960
that are going to be valuable in 30

1339
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,480
years time

1340
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,800
yeah so so that's why it's called post

1341
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,440
quantum because once quantum works

1342
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,960
at that kind of speed on those kind of

1343
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,119
keys which might take 30 years but you

1344
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,880
see

1345
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,800
five years ago we just said 50 years

1346
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,240
and some people are saying less than

1347
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,319
that you know

1348
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,760
so that's why post quantum is called

1349
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,599
post quantum because it's it's what you

1350
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,119
need to do to be

1351
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,400
safe

1352
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,560
once quantum computers work

1353
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,040
but again i reiterate my previous

1354
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,960
comment

1355
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,560
we're right at the start of quantum we

1356
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,560
don't really necessarily know everything

1357
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,960
it can do yet in fact i'd be

1358
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,800
gobsmacked frankly if we didn't know

1359
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,400
everything you could do yet because

1360
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,000
fundamentally underneath all those

1361
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,839
algorithms i showed you there's only

1362
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,079
about really four or five fundamental

1363
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,200
techniques that we're using for all

1364
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,560
those algorithms they all build on top

1365
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,880
of one another in some way so

1366
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,960
yeah early days

1367
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,160
but does that help answer the question

1368
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,720
yes

1369
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,720
absolutely

1370
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,359
yeah i mean but this is the problem is

1371
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,680
that people will say today oh we've had

1372
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,800
a breach

1373
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,000
but it's okay everything was encrypted

1374
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,960
yeah

1375
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,200
i mean i know that's not what you know a

1376
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,480
security consultants and everything else

1377
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,079
we'd like to hear but it that's

1378
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,319
happening every day now most data isn't

1379
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,319
going to be valuable in 30 years time

1380
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,839
but some is

1381
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,480
very small proportion is but some is

1382
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,880
so you know that's why

1383
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,480
that's why i say these things you know

1384
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,680
yes

1385
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,359
you want you don't want people to be

1386
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,480
able to walk off with large amounts of

1387
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,400
data even encrypted data um but

1388
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,720
people do

1389
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,359
well i i'm i'm not the person to say but

1390
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:58,960
you know um

1391
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,760
if you've got um some kind of

1392
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,680
legal documents that would be highly

1393
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,079
embarrassing if you've got intelligence

1394
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:07,440
that would be highly embarrassing and

1395
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,680
still valuable if it was released in 30

1396
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,160
years you know it's those kind of things

1397
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,920
you know and and some companies of

1398
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,400
course you know have got contracts that

1399
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,760
last for 30 years they need to find some

1400
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,880
way to secure to make sure they haven't

1401
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,880
been interfered with you know so it's

1402
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,760
it's those kind of things that you know

1403
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,079
it's a very small proportion

1404
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,760
but of course

1405
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,440
you know that's the kind of area that

1406
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,359
ibm deals with day in day out you know

1407
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,079
we don't deal with you know the smes or

1408
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,079
the small companies we deal with the

1409
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,760
regular traded industries and the people

1410
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,960
who have got that kind of data

1411
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,400
please

1412
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,319
oh that's a good question isn't it

1413
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,800
that's an excellent question

1414
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,200
given it given infinite time

1415
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,119
there's the quantum computer isn't doing

1416
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,440
anything that a that a supercomputer

1417
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,280
couldn't do with infinite time you know

1418
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,200
there's nothing

1419
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,720
there well there is something magic

1420
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,119
about them because because no one

1421
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,520
actually knows how they genuinely work

1422
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,200
so we know the maths we can get them to

1423
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,599
work we can do sums we can run programs

1424
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,359
we can reset you know we got them

1425
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,119
working with really good computers now

1426
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,000
yeah

1427
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,839
but actually you you asked two or three

1428
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:32,160
levels down of the question of yeah but

1429
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,160
how does superposition work and and why

1430
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,079
does entanglement do that and and why is

1431
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,200
it only when he's mathematically

1432
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,280
separate does he become really entangled

1433
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,880
and literally everybody looks and goes

1434
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,079
we don't know

1435
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:42,839
yeah

1436
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:44,160
multi-universities well you don't know

1437
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,760
there's you know there's a myriad of

1438
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,720
different explanations out there how

1439
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,880
these things work but no one knows so

1440
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,680
it's

1441
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,960
so even though we don't know how it's

1442
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,240
working down at that level what we do

1443
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,559
know is it is following

1444
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,800
a kind of predictable

1445
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,240
and even though it's inherently random

1446
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,599
but the way it works is inherently

1447
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,800
random

1448
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,160
we're using it to to perform repeatable

1449
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,400
problems you know it's just that each

1450
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,440
time you run it you never know you're

1451
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,200
going to get the same answer

1452
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,559
but but you're running a lot of times

1453
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,000
and you start finding out you've got the

1454
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,400
right answer you know it's so yeah so

1455
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,520
yes

1456
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,440
i don't think it violates turing's idea

1457
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,319
at all

1458
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:21,920
it's just that

1459
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,440
how you know

1460
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,200
it would take a long time to solve some

1461
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,200
of these problems

1462
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,640
longer than the lifetime of the universe

1463
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,759
so far probably

1464
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,720
any other questions

1465
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,240
i know i'm definitely between you guys

1466
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,760
and beer so

1467
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,119
i'm not expecting that i wasn't

1468
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,160
expecting even that many so thank you

1469
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,450
okay

1470
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:50,160
[Applause]

1471
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,839
and i think i might be coming to the

1472
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,720
hotel i'm not sure but i i but is it

1473
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,439
the after-dinner thing

1474
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,160
right um so that brings us to the end

1475
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,000
of this year's the tour de hack

1476
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,400
conference day i'll see i'm sure some of

1477
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,960
you tomorrow for the ctf day

1478
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,960
and i also want to say

1479
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,880
if any of you guys don't have the after

1480
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,319
party bands yet and you want to go to

1481
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,240
the after party i think richard you

1482
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,520
managed to miss yours um come see one of

1483
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,960
the committee members at the doors just

1484
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,440
stay behind and we will sort you out for

1485
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,040
that

1486
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,480
um

1487
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,480
thank you all for a great talk oh no say

1488
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,240
a huge thank you to our helpers and

1489
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,160
speak some of which are still next door

1490
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,400
still helping some which are still here

1491
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,440
helping

1492
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,280
um huge thank you to the committee

1493
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,520
you've made it a lot easier for me

1494
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,760
um a huge thank to our speakers huge
