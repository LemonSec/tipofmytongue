1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,799
um yeah i'm clara i'm a first year

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,639
student at napier

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,000
i've been involved with computer for

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,240
quite a couple years i was the best code

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,360
mentor dress codes a charity that

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,600
focuses on getting girls on the computer

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,359
um so yeah i'm just going to talk a bit

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,039
about the numbers and what we can do

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,480
about it

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,359
um

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,680
so yeah

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,400
so the field starts to lose people or

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
not gain people's interests as early as

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,238
primary but secondary skills really

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,840
where you can start to see the decline

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,880
happening

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,399
so as you can see in the graph the

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,559
numbers have been in decline from

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,920
females which is the blue and since 2014

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,000
and in fact further back from this graph

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,960
it's been dropping since 2003

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
so there was a slight increase in uptake

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,440
in 2020 so just last year

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,960
two years ago

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,480
and you can clearly see how much of a

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,760
gap exists between men and women

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,520
we're never going to get the numbers in

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,120
university if we can't capture the

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,000
interest early on um from both men and

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,920
women and the numbers for males have

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,200
also been dropping as you can see since

32
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,680
2016 and further back they've been on a

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,240
general decline since 2008.

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,000
um so a lot of schools are not a lot

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,840
some skills don't even offer computing

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,320
at all um and some rotate with other

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,960
classes so you get like less than 20

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,640
periods a year of computing and your

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,880
board general for the general education

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,759
year so that's like s1 to s3

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,799
um

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,040
and then so how can we prepare kids for

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,720
the necessary skills for computing

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,560
career or just life in general when

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
they're getting about 15 hours a year of

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,640
computer education

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,040
and a couple classes and a couple skills

48
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,680
in scotland have two or three different

49
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,079
levels of qualifications in one class so

50
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,000
they might have national four national

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,799
five and hires or something in the one

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,640
class so then the teachers have to

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,920
balance

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,600
multiple curriculums and multiple

55
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,320
courseworks um and just totally

56
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
different classes that shouldn't be the

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,320
same and obviously the kids suffer for

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,240
that

59
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,080
and if they're not good at secondary

60
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,199
school they're not going to get any

61
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,800
better undergrad

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,599
um

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,840
there's about 10 000 undergrad

64
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,160
applications in scotland every year

65
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
um within computing so that includes

66
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,120
like networking cyber security

67
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,959
software engineering creative and social

68
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,560
informatics anything that comes up in

69
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,040
computing and you can see the massive

70
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,080
gap in girls and boys again

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,280
this time the blue is the girls

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,319
and

73
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,480
yeah the overall the number is still

74
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,959
pretty low 10 000 compared to what the

75
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,599
demand could facilitate or like what we

76
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,959
could achieve

77
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,400
um if we put work into it

78
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
and we're not really producing the

79
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,000
amount of recruits that is necessary

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,120
anyway

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,239
um

82
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,480
there's about 13 000 digital jobs in

83
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,599
scotland

84
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,599
um the demand for that and we're only

85
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,760
producing like 5 000 new recruits each

86
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,560
year so massive gap in numbers and it

87
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,680
raises the issue that scotland-based

88
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,080
companies have to go overseas to find

89
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,280
the skill that they need in their

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,200
require

91
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,599
um as well in undergrad

92
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,319
18 there's about 18 women say 82 of any

93
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,440
given computing degree is men

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,120
and this can be more or less dependent

95
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,720
on the university

96
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,120
um and the issue isn't solely with women

97
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,440
and envies and non-binary people but

98
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,879
with everyone in general and in

99
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,480
2016-17 the academic year

100
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,599
9.8 of graduates in computer science

101
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,080
dropped out in computer science fees

102
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,720
which is 2.6 higher than the mean

103
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,440
dropout rate of all subjects

104
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,640
um

105
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,480
based on other trends there's no more

106
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,000
new data on this but based on other

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,360
trends it's probable that this has

108
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,879
continued

109
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,040
um so as i said

110
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,360
that the problem originates as early as

111
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,200
primary school but even for women who

112
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,799
made it to the tech industry the

113
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,959
struggle's not over

114
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,959
women are at risk of quitting their job

115
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,439
at 45 higher rate than men in the tech

116
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,840
sector

117
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,920
and they're habitually outnumbered by

118
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,760
men in tech companies

119
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,439
we know this based on the gender gap in

120
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,279
almost every part of computing

121
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,600
there's a general two to one ratio and

122
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,720
26 of people of women in a survey have

123
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
been outnumbered five to one multiple

124
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,800
times before

125
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,479
and on top of that

126
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,600
30 of women over the age of 35 are still

127
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,440
in junior positions

128
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,040
and on the flip side less than five

129
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
percent of men are

130
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,560
and and that's

131
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,080
even if they get the junior position to

132
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,479
start with so a hesa study and that's a

133
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,680
uk wide company um

134
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,080
company research groups like that

135
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,120
found that 73 of male graduates from

136
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,040
computing are in a tech world six months

137
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,520
after graduation compared to 58 of

138
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,960
females

139
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,680
and the issue isn't just around women as

140
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,199
i said before 75 of employees are having

141
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,479
difficulties in

142
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,280
recruiting qualified staff due to the

143
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,280
lack of workforce so as a whole we can

144
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,560
really see that computing is a

145
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,120
struggling subject

146
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,960
so in 2001

147
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,800
we in scotland had just over 8 28 000

148
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,560
students studying computer and exam

149
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,039
level so that's not five higher in

150
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,080
advance higher in high school

151
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,880
with

152
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,840
9825 women say even in 2001 there's a

153
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,759
massive gap

154
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,639
um especially

155
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,440
and this dropped in nine years so in

156
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,720
2010 we had a little over 22 thousand

157
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,560
and 7 100 of them were women so that's

158
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,479
quite a substantial drop in nine years

159
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,759
especially considering the tech

160
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,840
explosion that happened in that decade

161
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,880
and if we go to last year's figures

162
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,840
um only

163
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,039
9873 people study computer science

164
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,360
and of that less than 2 000 women take

165
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,479
the subject

166
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,400
so in the whole of scotland we're

167
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,759
currently sitting at 1895

168
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,479
women taking computing not even

169
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,000
wanting to take a career in it just

170
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
having an exam

171
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
in this computing

172
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,639
and the number of teachers has also

173
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,759
dropped from 699 to 595 in 10 years

174
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,840
and we just can't wait and sit for this

175
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
to fix itself

176
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,199
um we can see the skill and update

177
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,520
decline isn't a new thing

178
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,240
in fact in 2012 on the 3rd of april so

179
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,880
almost a decade to the day the bbc

180
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,759
published an article called warning over

181
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,919
skills gap in computing

182
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,240
so a literal decade and the problems

183
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,039
only got worse so we just can't afford

184
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,759
another 10 years in this situation we

185
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,840
all have to act now to save the subject

186
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,919
and the path to doing that is definitely

187
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,440
a high school level

188
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,199
i'm getting that support for teachers as

189
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,440
well as well as hooking that interest

190
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,360
before pupils even choose their subjects

191
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,000
in third year

192
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,759
so yeah there's a lot of reasons why

193
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,919
people might leave computer science and

194
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,639
we need to acknowledge and act on these

195
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,720
um the reasons i give here uh for

196
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,479
leaving computer science at any stage so

197
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,919
some might be like more relevant to high

198
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,919
school or industry

199
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,560
so why women and nb's might specifically

200
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,720
leave computer science

201
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,120
we've got social identity threat so

202
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,720
women can feel their identity within

203
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,800
computing is perceived as unusual or

204
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,440
negative or they're just feeling unease

205
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,759
or on guard about who they are within

206
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,000
computing and we do have like quite

207
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,840
strong stereotypes in computing and that

208
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,400
can just relate to that um a lot of

209
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,280
people

210
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,120
a lot of women especially have avoided

211
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,280
feeling imposter syndrome

212
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,319
um

213
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,240
and the lack of support is definitely a

214
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,599
big issue there's a significant gap

215
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,599
obviously within gender as well as a

216
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,520
curriculum and jobs typically fashioned

217
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
to men so it's necessary to have that

218
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,440
support available and while there's the

219
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,800
gap

220
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,400
the fear of knowing less than male

221
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,840
counterparts stigma lack of role models

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,919
and that's a really important one and

223
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,160
recently as part of a

224
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,000
research group called

225
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
computing science young people's advisor

226
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,639
group um as part of the carried out

227
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,960
survey um on what students thought were

228
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,800
the buyers to competing and this came up

229
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,080
quite a bit in responses

230
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,000
some people have also reported being

231
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,360
discouraged

232
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,559
by authority such as teachers or career

233
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,039
advisors and parents

234
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,519
and being steered away from computing is

235
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,360
it just it can't be a subject for them

236
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,919
or like multitude of reasons

237
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,760
um and similar to this is not being

238
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,040
taken seriously um

239
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,480
people if people around you aren't

240
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,640
taking you seriously just for the

241
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,240
basis of your gender that's going to be

242
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,519
hard to

243
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,160
get motivation and to stay interested in

244
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,200
it

245
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,600
um and the atmosphere in the workplace

246
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,760
and microaggressions just are sort of

247
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,160
all of these things combined

248
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,279
um

249
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,640
and it can like it it's often a

250
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,720
combination of all these reasons oh

251
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,399
these reasons and the ones i'll get to

252
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,320
in a second it's never just one which is

253
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
where you have to look at all of them as

254
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,640
a whole

255
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,279
so the issue isn't just solely with

256
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,279
women and angries as i've said

257
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,920
anyone might leave computer science

258
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,959
so

259
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,800
some reasons might be lack of retention

260
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
in high school teaching

261
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,120
some schools face a high turnover

262
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,959
for these teachers as they move on to

263
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,120
different things so they drop out

264
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,480
and this makes it hard to create that

265
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
student-teacher relationship and it

266
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,680
makes it hard to build a strong

267
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,640
computing department

268
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,600
and anyone can say face some of the

269
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,360
reasons like lack of support and lack of

270
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,760
guidance

271
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,120
if students don't know what's coming

272
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,360
next and not knowing what to expect then

273
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,560
it can make it really difficult to

274
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,640
choose to continue down that path of

275
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,480
uncertainty when there's other more

276
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,079
secure or more

277
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,839
transparent subjects to take

278
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,760
and sometimes people don't feel that

279
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,519
they need it for their career which is

280
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,839
like totally fine but

281
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,600
it's such an important aspect in all of

282
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
our lives and understanding a bit of

283
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
that and learning some skills which as

284
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,519
i'm sure we all know is pretty cool and

285
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,279
really necessary for

286
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,800
a wide assortment of jobs not just

287
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,360
computing related

288
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
so there's also the issue that some

289
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,399
people don't even get access to

290
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,560
computing they don't get an option to

291
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,240
study it in high school at all they

292
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,320
didn't get to study in s1

293
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,560
and s1 if you don't get to study it when

294
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,880
you first come to high school it's gonna

295
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,640
be really hard to get that interest in

296
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,160
second year because i've had a whole

297
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,240
year of other subjects to like learn

298
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,440
about and hope that interesting

299
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,600
some as i said earlier rotate with other

300
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,279
classes so they're getting less than one

301
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,519
every fortnight

302
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,000
of computing so how how

303
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,519
are they expected to understand the

304
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,600
subject and to want to take it further

305
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,519
if they're hardly getting any class time

306
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,600
so another issue that people it tends to

307
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,680
be in smaller times and villages that

308
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,880
people face is they don't have a

309
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,200
computing specific teacher um they're

310
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,279
just there's just not the

311
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,760
teachers available to go to the

312
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,560
uh like the urban areas

313
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,800
and then finally giving worksheets some

314
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,279
teachers and some classes are quite

315
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,959
lacking in their curriculum and they

316
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,720
just get worksheets and

317
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,640
we know how amazing computing can be

318
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,200
actually as you're all here

319
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,480
but if you just get worksheets you're

320
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,360
never going to see that

321
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,680
so what we can do about it so that was a

322
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,440
lot of like

323
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,279
look at how bad this is so this is some

324
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,240
things that we can do

325
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,440
so

326
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,920
we can create support systems

327
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,959
um

328
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,320
so that's just so important for

329
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,639
retention

330
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,920
and i've lost myself

331
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,040
and

332
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,920
so yeah as i said earlier almost every

333
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,519
woman or number any i have met

334
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,720
completely and just faced imposter

335
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,120
syndrome so having them support systems

336
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,600
and contacts in industry they can really

337
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,399
just make you feel a lot better about

338
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,000
your career and where you can go

339
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,079
and then

340
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,079
and then also role models are great for

341
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,680
opening that path to computing and

342
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,040
helping people

343
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,680
um and collaborative product projects

344
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,160
i'm a really big fan on on those there's

345
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,000
hardly going to be a time in computing

346
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,320
when you're working on your own with no

347
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,200
help from anyone else so why would we

348
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,720
not encourage collaboration from the

349
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,160
start and start working together to

350
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,519
solve problems

351
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,360
so that can build connections with

352
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,040
students and gives people the chance to

353
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,639
learn and teach in a less formal

354
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,320
environment

355
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,000
and the last one there is really

356
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,320
important and i know we might not be

357
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,240
able to do loads like this other than

358
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,079
petition and fight for it but funding

359
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,839
teachers are so necessary to grow the

360
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,240
subject there's only so much we can talk

361
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,399
about clubs and projects as the teachers

362
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,399
we hoped around these are pulled in so

363
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,279
many directions

364
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,959
industry as a whole can also help a lot

365
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,720
um they have such a pivotal effect on

366
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,040
people's confidence and access to

367
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,839
further career furthering opportunities

368
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,279
so we've got mentorship programs and

369
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,959
they can give someone a contact in

370
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,240
industry because like they went through

371
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,839
similar stuff

372
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,279
and they can offer support to students

373
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,639
or new people

374
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,320
and they don't they can be formal or

375
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,839
informal

376
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:38,720
um

377
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,320
and i can't speak highly enough of

378
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,839
having someone to just support you and

379
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,440
push you upwards

380
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
um they don't even have to be industry

381
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,360
they can be teachers or students further

382
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,000
up or senior years of skill

383
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,040
there's also competitions um

384
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,399
they're a really good way of fostering

385
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,160
community within the attendees and the

386
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,160
good way to share information

387
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,040
information around teams

388
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,279
sponsorships are really good they can

389
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,199
take a financial offload they can give

390
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,880
someone a contact

391
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,399
and they

392
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,920
yeah they can just make it a lot easier

393
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,199
for someone to get into a career

394
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,440
and then asking for minorities feedback

395
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,680
of women and other minorities is really

396
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,040
good because you're not going to know

397
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,720
what people want if you don't ask them

398
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,800
and it makes them feel really heard if

399
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,760
you specifically ask them

400
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,000
so yeah our own actions so this is

401
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
something that you can really work on if

402
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,199
you choose to and you should if you

403
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,160
choose to

404
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,480
so we can so while change can and should

405
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,399
happen at these larger levels there's

406
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,760
always small things that we as

407
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
individuals can do and these are things

408
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,680
that can have the biggest impact short

409
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,920
term and they can gather momentum and

410
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,320
change the atmosphere so we can question

411
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,079
how we view the gender gap and the

412
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,519
workforce in general and if it's

413
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,480
conducive to closing that

414
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,399
and question our own biases so we all

415
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,839
have them and these can translate to

416
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,760
microaggressions and not seeing like for

417
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,920
example women only events are productive

418
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,240
and important for us or not believe in

419
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,440
the issue can be solved because

420
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,639
obviously women don't want to do

421
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,000
computing which just isn't true

422
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,680
and to look at that and question why we

423
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,000
think that is really important

424
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,920
um being an ally

425
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,839
is really good and to give credit where

426
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,839
credit is g is one of the best ways to

427
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,760
demonstrate that and create an inclusive

428
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,319
environment

429
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,760
so yeah it's not all bad thing

430
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,040
um

431
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,959
i want to share a success story with you

432
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,279
so i was incredibly fortunate to attend

433
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,519
an amazing secondary school and we had

434
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,199
an amazing computing department the

435
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,480
school wasn't that good the computer

436
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,040
department was great um we had an almost

437
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,600
50 50 split of girls and boys

438
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,240
with seven s3 classes so that's the year

439
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,079
before exams um and then in exam classes

440
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,880
we had four s4 classes three higher

441
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,440
classes one advanced hire and an mpa

442
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,880
class

443
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,480
and this didn't come about by letting it

444
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,519
be the my department consistently worked

445
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,079
hard at hooking that interest early and

446
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,040
let

447
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,600
and maintaining it

448
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,120
so yeah there's

449
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,720
down to a lot of factors and a lot of

450
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,279
trial and error so in my opinion one

451
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,720
thing that worked really well was

452
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,320
building that strong student-teacher

453
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,680
relationship

454
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
um everyone who chose higher computing

455
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,000
at my school had at least had a personal

456
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,279
relationship with at least one of the

457
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,440
teachers and having that and someone to

458
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,959
talk to when he passed the department

459
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,120
was really good at cementing people's

460
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,320
interests

461
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,000
and having a laugh with people is really

462
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,160
fun even if like i was doing my advanced

463
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,959
high project i wanted to cry i could go

464
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,199
and have some banner with my classmates

465
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,800
and so it's just really important to

466
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,199
have a strong student teacher but also a

467
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,759
student student like to

468
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,519
do outreach within societies and to

469
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,040
just these stations as well and like

470
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
many different areas like not just

471
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,199
always at a park or a clock a club just

472
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,199
like in different places so

473
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,720
accessibility-wise there's a lot of

474
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,040
options for people

475
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,519
um competitions and coding clubs

476
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,119
so they're a really good structure to

477
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,679
base that encouragement on um

478
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,959
just getting

479
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,439
as many people into it as possible um so

480
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,359
during my time at dresco club which i

481
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,000
was talking about earlier

482
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,839
i noticed great things about the passion

483
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,119
that students can have when they're

484
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,079
given the opportunity so the difference

485
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,880
in

486
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,640
someone's engagement can be so

487
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,319
noticeable depending on the environment

488
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,559
they're in um if they're in class if

489
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,919
they're in a lunchtime club if they're

490
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,280
with their friends if they're on their

491
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
own it just really does depend and

492
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,200
giving them that option and having that

493
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,600
safe space can bring out some amazing

494
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,200
projects as well as boosting people's

495
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,760
confidence

496
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,520
so creative more collaborative

497
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,080
projects are really good um having

498
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
freedom and creativity in younger years

499
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,559
and really wherever possible and is

500
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,320
really important i think keeping that

501
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,640
passion and that love for computing is

502
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,520
paramount in closing that gap

503
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,720
um

504
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,240
people will learn what they need to and

505
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,919
if they don't you can offer options for

506
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,679
learning but

507
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,919
people do tend to

508
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,840
learn what they need to

509
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,600
just give in

510
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,120
just giving a

511
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,840
in the right direction

512
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,400
so a flexible curriculum is similar to

513
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,559
that um it's a bit harder obviously when

514
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,240
you're in third and fourth year of the

515
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
university degree and you need to do

516
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,000
things but having

517
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,080
options especially in first year that

518
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,360
people can do

519
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,000
and having options within like society

520
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,120
is really

521
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,080
good

522
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,520
at just like maintaining that and

523
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,360
keeping that passion because people do

524
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,840
love computing and

525
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,320
i've met so many people in young years

526
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,679
like in high school that really really

527
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,000
loved it and i know that

528
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,120
a lot of them

529
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,720
will lose out on that just because of

530
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,000
the access that they have

531
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,400
and finally having a supportive teaching

532
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,120
department is really important because

533
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,799
teachers if they

534
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,080
are pulling their weight and if they

535
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,640
have people that they can support that

536
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,559
can support them all the time it's just

537
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,600
really good

538
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,280
and it comes it shows that in the

539
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,720
students and it shows that they have a

540
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,880
love for the subject

541
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,240
so yeah it really is possible to

542
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
turn this skills direct

543
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,039
skills decline around with some targeted

544
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,000
work

545
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,080
um and it's really it is happening we

546
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,400
can see there's so many movements

547
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,840
that are

548
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,240
making this happen um but we really just

549
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,720
do have to work hard and

550
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,160
it's going to take a while until we see

551
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,000
results but we've just got to keep

552
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,679
working on it

553
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,559
for women and just anyone in general

554
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,440
in computing

555
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,880
so yeah thank you for listening

556
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,149
[Applause]

557
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,600
you
