1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,800
hey guys uh welcome to my talk today i'm

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,240
going to just be talking about my

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,320
journey into cyber security and kind of

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,400
investigations you deal with within the

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,359
microsoft environment so with a an

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,640
introduction who am i so i am a alumni

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,560
of edward nippy university and i

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,720
graduated just like nearly two years ago

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,800
uh i'm a security analyst at quorum

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,080
cyber uh an active member of nsx so

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,439
thank you for any psych for having me

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,840
here today uh i'm an interest all things

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,000
blue teams and forensics um so yeah

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,440
um

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,200
so how did i get to this point um

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,719
surprisingly at first i actually want to

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,239
do marine biology for the longest time

18
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,760
when i was like younger so i just had

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,200
like an interest in like sharks when i

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,760
seen jaws i just had like a real weird

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,239
fascination with it um but it kind of

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,000
just didn't work out but i

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,239
again had an interest at it as well so

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,160
kind of develop that area as well and

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,399
kind of got good with it i

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,000
ended up doing the diploma

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,760
and learned different aspects from it

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,360
and that's kind of where i came across

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,479
cyber security because i didn't know

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,000
much about it at the time

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,680
and then that's pretty much where the

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,840
fun things began where i was like oh

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,080
hacking what is that

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,840
and so yeah i wanted to learn more about

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,119
that

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,080
um

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,799
pretty much just from there i learned

38
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,640
being a animal napier like i learned

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,080
different side more things about blue

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,640
team or whatever what kind of friends

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,560
that you can have within digital

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,680
aspects

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,479
and

44
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,320
it was able to join societies like any

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,000
sec where i was able to like meet like

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
most of the people i know here today

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,759
and join meet ups as well they could

48
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,200
help me develop my own personal

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,640
interests and talks and subjects on

50
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,680
today

51
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,159
and competing in ctfs and attendant

52
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,320
conferences not just this one today so

53
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,280
yeah

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,680
um

55
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,960
pretty much from there though i've i got

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,799
hired a quorum cyber just shortly after

57
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,079
i got

58
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,360
graduated

59
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,200
and uh pretty much speaking on my

60
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,960
journey as a security analyst so

61
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,719
essentially what my day-to-day is like

62
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,079
is

63
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,920
monitoring triaging threats for

64
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,040
customers

65
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,360
and learning more about dealing with

66
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,920
various levels of priority for alerts

67
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,800
and

68
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,280
understanding kind of like hi

69
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,000
essentially any priority even if a alert

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,080
has got with base within an sla like

71
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,760
when you respond this fast they may not

72
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,680
be as serious compared to some other

73
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,000
things so you know some users are

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,640
signing in from different locations or

75
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,400
executing commands they're not meant to

76
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,200
like

77
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
someone from payroll could be xk net

78
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
commands like that's not meant to happen

79
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,640
and that's definitely suspicious

80
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,519
um

81
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,400
and other tasks i can provide with them

82
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,480
internal fixes and

83
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,920
recommend um

84
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,440
recommendations on alerts that they need

85
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,280
to be tuned they may be too noisy so if

86
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,879
there's a false police show up for this

87
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,720
piece of files triggers malware within

88
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,720
the vendor environment then you may need

89
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,800
to like figure out okay why is this file

90
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,879
malicious in the first or false balls in

91
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,239
the first place and understand that from

92
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,800
there am i working with a great team to

93
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
help fight these threats against with

94
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,760
our clients and pretty much just from

95
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,920
there i am things may also go into going

96
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,000
fire time to times um

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,360
just understanding how to deal with

98
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,040
those incidents is pretty much a key

99
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,400
aspect of being in a security company

100
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,599
so without further ado um so start off

101
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,080
uh investigating threats within azure

102
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,680
signals so azure sentinel was kind of

103
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,239
the primary seam environment that i use

104
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,760
um

105
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,840
for log analysis and other aspects as

106
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,280
well within quorum

107
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,599
um what i can you can do with it

108
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,360
essentially is just filter through logs

109
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,720
or set up iocs for example and like with

110
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,640
screenshot above there shows like

111
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
different alerts that come in so

112
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,599
essentially what those alerts do is they

113
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,280
come into our ticketing system and you

114
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,799
work from out there like to understand

115
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,040
like okay why is this a alert in the

116
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,959
first place and what the overall

117
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,560
classification is it

118
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,840
at the end of the day

119
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,360
um

120
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,560
and essentially pretty much going from

121
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,400
there really um

122
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,200
like uh sentinel also uses like a kql

123
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,959
for example so that's custo's curry

124
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,000
language this helps uh help hunt for

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,599
events or

126
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,959
filter through logs because you can get

127
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,799
like hundreds of thousands of logs and

128
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,400
you're not going to be stepping through

129
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,880
all day like calcul helps you get from a

130
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,279
hundred thousand to like three and for

131
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,680
the example query below there shows like

132
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,600
a signer log table so um

133
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
so yeah cyanologues represents the table

134
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,199
so the table is like where you could

135
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,440
you're starting to like find data in so

136
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,800
um

137
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,560
within a sine logs you can be able to

138
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,000
see like what's the user signing

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,080
activity what does it look like is it

140
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,919
denying is it malicious or like what

141
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,320
kind of vpns are they using for example

142
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,720
um and what was the user principal name

143
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,240
that could be like their email address

144
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,400
for example like uh what you're trying

145
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,600
to filter by

146
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,680
and the device details so what kind of

147
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,919
advice were you using for me here i was

148
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,440
using um

149
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,680
just filtering only by android devices

150
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,280
within their logs

151
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,080
and through project in it so i wanted to

152
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,160
project certain columns because when

153
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,520
you're looking through certain tables

154
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
like this one here there may be a lot of

155
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,560
uh

156
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,880
and columns that just may be

157
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
maybe useful in some maybe is

158
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,199
may not be at all so using project helps

159
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,280
you uh clear success throughout there

160
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,440
and find only pieces of evidence you

161
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
want to have

162
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,560
and

163
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,280
moving on there microsoft also has other

164
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
methods of investigation or

165
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,680
investigating so like following portals

166
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,280
such as like microsoft defender for

167
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,560
endpoint defender fight identity and

168
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,639
defender for cutoffs and many many more

169
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,360
i mean i could to talk on them on the

170
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,840
zone but yeah here i am

171
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,039
um

172
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,280
you'd be able to help me use these

173
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,240
portals to help further investigation

174
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,160
and further prove the classification of

175
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,400
overall for an alert and or an incident

176
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,319
that you might be investigating

177
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,560
and evidence can be easily correlated as

178
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,639
well and when placed within just one

179
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,000
neat uh ticket as i mentioned before uh

180
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,160
and this helps um build a timeline of

181
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,720
when the incident occurred

182
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,639
so starting off with the fender for

183
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,479
clyde apps this is one of the uh

184
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,400
portals that helps manage

185
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,240
more or less what kind of applications

186
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
you're using within your

187
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,639
microsoft environment or your org

188
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,800
general organization it allows for like

189
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,120
a modern over shadow id apps so these

190
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,720
may be

191
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,960
applications that may not be necessarily

192
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,919
like applicable for um

193
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,319
uh use within the organization so such

194
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,639
as like um facebook or other social

195
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,960
media and other applications that maybe

196
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,720
just deemed like to be like be a bit of

197
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,639
a nuisance for advertisement so like

198
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,160
this helps you monitor like okay who

199
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,840
else has been uh who's been using this

200
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,400
is it a sanction app um what kind of

201
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,160
idea have they been doing or updating

202
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,599
from a performing transactions for

203
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,080
example and whatnot and it also helps

204
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,840
you stay on top of like what kind of

205
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,440
office activities are performed within

206
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,960
office 365

207
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,120
so um if they're performing like a mass

208
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,199
download or a mass apple um alert for

209
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,880
example so that's when like

210
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,080
uh users download and then a

211
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,800
number of items within a specific

212
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,840
space of time or uploading a number of

213
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,440
item spaces a certain space of time as

214
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,400
well

215
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,720
and this helps stay on top of like f for

216
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,599
example you have certain sensitive uh

217
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,919
uh file polls says dlp with data loss

218
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:30,880
prevention

219
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,759
this helps uh stay on top of when um

220
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,440
sensitive files that you've tagged may

221
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,039
be shared around within the organization

222
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,720
so say if

223
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,440
you had an external a user with a gmail

224
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,120
address that the file was shared to your

225
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,960
right okay is this user meant to be

226
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,639
shared with like who are they within the

227
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,800
organization like that's sharing the

228
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,319
file to this person within the gmail

229
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,400
address

230
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,240
and that helps like show like were

231
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,319
already able to access the file and

232
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,960
within going back to sentinel you can be

233
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
able to see the office logs

234
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,759
to see it was the data data fx will

235
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,280
trade it as well

236
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,240
um the cloud apps also helps uh show a

237
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,840
number of various

238
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
alerts as well so going back to sign

239
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,000
activity and what commands might be

240
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,319
executed so like remote code execution

241
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,360
and maybe powershell for example or wam

242
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,960
ic

243
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
or it could also be system alert so it's

244
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,520
generally if you say have connectors

245
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,720
within

246
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,560
um sentinel so those are just typically

247
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,039
like a

248
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,039
your um

249
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,039
different connectors for

250
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,679
that defender or endpoint or

251
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,479
mcas for example which is this here

252
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,399
and you may have these characters set up

253
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,440
to have uh tables viewed

254
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,959
and within the logs

255
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,480
and

256
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,800
well if a character breaks for example

257
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,200
uh like dropbox you may have a system

258
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,120
art set up to like notify you so like if

259
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,399
there's like a system error it's much

260
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,760
like a uh

261
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,000
but like a windows message so say like

262
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,279
if someone's been broken within your

263
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,959
pc and you're able to access the app

264
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,959
that is much similar to what it will pop

265
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,880
up in mcas

266
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,600
and so just going to show an example so

267
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,000
here you have the alerts that shows here

268
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,160
so users could be signed in for

269
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,839
anonymous ip address so that's much like

270
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,040
a vpn

271
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,399
or other

272
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,519
um

273
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,760
ips are maybe just triggers like uh

274
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,399
abnormal or anonymous multiple field

275
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,560
attempts so that's like maybe 500 field

276
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,040
attempts to certain application or

277
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,200
um

278
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,399
a certain um device for example within a

279
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,480
certain given time maybe it may be

280
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,160
related to brute force attempt may not

281
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,360
be it just

282
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,120
depends really on like what way you set

283
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,279
the policy and going as i mentioned

284
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,880
there like usual file dyno that's like

285
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,200
your mass dyno file as i've mentioned

286
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,519
previously so users don't know the x and

287
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,519
the things within a space of time so say

288
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,040
if it was an insider thread like i mean

289
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,720
they may want to download a lot of files

290
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,080
to a certain point and it may be

291
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,920
suspicious we may want to have a look

292
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,519
further like what kind of file they were

293
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,040
dying and if it was like meant to be a

294
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,839
approved transaction

295
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,920
over here you can see that they have

296
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,600
like different discovered apps so uh

297
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,200
going back to a um

298
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,760
high uh you can monitor your uh the

299
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
shadow it ups so over here you can see

300
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,480
like like i said like onedrive and mega

301
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,079
so like your file sharing um

302
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,079
applications like icloud so this is like

303
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,240
able to stay on top of it and microsoft

304
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,920
has like certain classifications like

305
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,519
given a reign of a security score like

306
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,560
10

307
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,680
so it allows for and the likes of if a

308
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,320
security score a 10 if if it's given a

309
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,480
scooter security score of 10 it will be

310
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,640
good for like compliance or like other

311
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,120
um things within your environment and

312
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,880
such just like social media applications

313
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,640
for example may be given like a six

314
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
because it's just maybe not compliant

315
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,560
given for data previously

316
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,200
data privacy reasons and whatnot

317
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,959
and this just helps really stay on top

318
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,320
of like how many users are like

319
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,079
currently accessing that application

320
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,200
since like

321
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,040
june of last year so you'll be able to

322
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,959
stay on top of like who

323
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,959
what is performing it and what i p

324
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,480
address might be performing it from for

325
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,320
example and whatnot

326
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,839
um

327
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,440
moving on from there we have fender for

328
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,640
endpoint so this uh portal actually

329
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,320
manages quite a lot within your

330
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,160
environment and you can i can

331
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,519
practically do a talk on it so i don't

332
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,200
like to give like mind to things in it

333
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,279
but just to summarize and defender fin

334
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,040
point is like an enterprise security

335
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,360
solution that um helps uh enterprise

336
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,399
network detect investigate and respond

337
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,120
to advanced threats so going back to

338
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,600
powershell commands being executed or

339
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,680
anything on that particular you may be

340
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,839
able to see what command was executed

341
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,560
when was the command executed from like

342
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,680
who did it

343
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,120
and whatnot

344
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,680
and you also have like sort of a

345
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,120
automated investigation so it's just

346
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,160
much like a defender on your

347
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,959
personal device like if you had malware

348
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,279
uh detected on your device and the

349
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,880
fender would pick that up based on

350
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,480
certain um

351
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,639
signatures and whatnot fit on the depend

352
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,880
on the file and quarantine it on

353
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,480
automation as much as i got there where

354
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,680
like you

355
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,959
initiate

356
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,880
essentially a robot does it on your

357
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,760
behalf and and remediates the file

358
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,680
before you can do it so it seems more

359
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,519
like administers a lot of time kind of

360
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,839
like individually going through each

361
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,320
like device that might be infected and

362
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,079
these like these policies are in place

363
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,240
to help stop that

364
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
and just kind of like save a lot of time

365
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,120
and

366
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,560
manage for

367
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,440
um and um you have also like like

368
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,279
features like a attack

369
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,800
training simulations so this slide is

370
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,959
for simulating real-world attacks for

371
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,600
like you know from likes of atp groups

372
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,519
and you can have like likes of

373
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,760
credential stuffing or password spraying

374
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
attacks for example and you what you

375
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,480
could do is you have set these up with

376
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,800
your organizations and train users on it

377
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,720
so if you had set up like a fish

378
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,600
campaign to a set mighty users within a

379
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,079
team for example and you could see who

380
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,200
could click on the uh fish email or who

381
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,079
entered in their credentials or

382
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,040
be able to get a gist of who reported it

383
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,120
and essentially what it does is that it

384
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,680
helps with the likes of

385
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,639
training them so what if they if they do

386
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,079
get caught they will be just told like

387
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,399
yeah this was a fish test you did feel

388
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,560
but here's recommendations prevented in

389
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,800
the future so we'll go through microsoft

390
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,200
official training to help with

391
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,000
um any protect preventing any real

392
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,480
life attacks that may occur to in your

393
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,519
organization um defender friend point

394
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,399
particularly is good for

395
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,160
uploading your endpoints too so if you

396
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,399
on board an endpoint you'd be able to

397
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,959
monitor all the activity too so like so

398
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,959
seeing this device timeline what kind of

399
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,079
um

400
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,440
getting going by the commands being

401
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
executed and what kind of processes are

402
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,760
being run um who was logging in on a

403
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,360
device at certain times like is it a

404
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,720
shared computer is it a personal

405
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,680
computer and whatnot and um

406
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,440
just giving a gist of like if malware

407
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,279
prevented or if there's a malicious file

408
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,760
attachment for example like what what

409
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,360
kind of activity was seen within the

410
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,680
basis of a

411
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,040
time frame like what happened before

412
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,320
like because particularly if you have

413
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,600
like

414
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,519
like a ransomware um campaign on the go

415
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,120
like you may want to see like well who

416
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,800
was logging on the device this time like

417
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,560
what kind of um activity was on this

418
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
device like a week or 30 days ago like

419
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,839
you want to get they want to build a

420
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,000
good timeline about and defend your

421
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,800
endpoint helps a lot and just many other

422
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,599
things as well so

423
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,360
here it just is a good example of what

424
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,120
it looks like so um

425
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,360
be able to see over here this gives you

426
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,560
a summary of what a multi-stage insulin

427
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,440
looks like so typically if an a alert

428
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,680
comes in within sentinel and it gives

429
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,120
you a link for this portal here it

430
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,959
redirects you straight to where the

431
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,560
alert took place

432
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,800
and what can it what it can do is it

433
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,560
shows you giving you like a device a

434
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,519
nice timeline of when what was occurring

435
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,760
within the file like what kind of file

436
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
was seen within user device like what

437
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,079
kind of processor being run was adobe or

438
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,839
was it word for example

439
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,480
if a number of alerts were being

440
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,240
triggered in the same place it could

441
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,160
create like a multi-stage

442
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,560
incident and what defender does is that

443
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,320
it coordinates all that together and

444
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,639
does exactly what this screenshot shows

445
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,120
here so shows like 95 alerts for this

446
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,680
one device but two users were seen with

447
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,519
it as well and there's three mailboxes

448
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,560
involved

449
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,399
so what that um helps with is just

450
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,240
correlating like to see like what what

451
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,920
are we alert somewhere in nature like

452
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,240
what kind of activity was seen i don't

453
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,199
know

454
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,639
an automation essential this is where

455
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,320
automation kind of kicks in so

456
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,920
automation is doing essentially all this

457
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,440
in the background for you and like

458
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,279
correlates all those evidence for you

459
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,199
and the investigation bit over there is

460
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,880
like showing like automation is a

461
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,040
kicking in to run a scan on like the

462
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,720
device itself like is there malware

463
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
present this device like what

464
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,639
was it did it fail was it succeeded like

465
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,959
what kind was the overall end result of

466
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,399
it of that scan

467
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,839
and then it collects like evidence and

468
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,680
response that's like typically like what

469
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,600
kind of files and processes we're seeing

470
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,360
and helps you kind of figure out like

471
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,759
okay what is there like any suspicious

472
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,240
um

473
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,560
processes being run at the same time or

474
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,839
executed for example um

475
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,680
and yeah um you can be able to just like

476
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,120
essentially just like do a lot with this

477
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,639
portal like i mean like over here just

478
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,399
like you could essentially going back to

479
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,480
like you can do a talk really on its own

480
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,680
on this portal because there's so much

481
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,800
to

482
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,120
and just another

483
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,560
screenshot here this shows a likes of um

484
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,399
about something so vance hunting portal

485
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,360
uh like much like a kql within sentinel

486
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,120
you can use avant something to get

487
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,959
further evidence within your um

488
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,480
uh

489
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,399
organization itself so say for example

490
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,639
if there was um post delivery events

491
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,639
within an email you may want to have a

492
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,000
have a look at what kind of um

493
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,040
uh

494
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,880
emails were seen with them let's just

495
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,240
file attachments for example or if they

496
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,600
were fish related like you want to kind

497
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,919
of correlate that evidence together and

498
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,679
figure out okay within a certain period

499
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,720
of time he also stimulus device and

500
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,079
i want to see like what kind of action

501
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,760
types were performed on it and it kind

502
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,000
of helps you build up it here then the

503
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,359
other cool thing about this here is that

504
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,199
like you can actually set up like custom

505
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,520
alert detections on this as well so when

506
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,760
log4j happened and microsoft did have

507
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,799
like custom queries for uh organizations

508
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,319
so essentially you could you could stick

509
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,160
custom queries here and run it with your

510
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,240
environment and it helps you figure out

511
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,080
okay what out of like a lot of endpoints

512
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,960
who

513
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,360
and servers for example like may have

514
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,799
them

515
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,559
maybe an effective log for j and like

516
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,440
what

517
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,240
hot and wider the version so you can

518
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,520
focus on that

519
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,120
from and on

520
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,720
and

521
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,559
moving on really from defender of

522
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,480
identity for the last portal

523
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,280
and this is pretty much where you get

524
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,320
your

525
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,480
uh identity solution

526
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,600
so let's just kind of like just

527
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,799
leveraging more on your um

528
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,440
on-prem uh active directory to like

529
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,919
identify like um high threats within

530
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,120
your uh

531
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,960
directory itself so like for example

532
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,679
like

533
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,160
force attempts or pass a heart

534
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,400
or

535
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,480
ldap queries for example um like it just

536
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,000
shows you like everything that's been

537
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,160
running within this portal for example

538
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,960
so

539
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,080
um

540
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,679
yeah it just really it really does help

541
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,880
with that there and like this is like

542
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,360
well now microsoft's official and where

543
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,880
it all is

544
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,360
so looking at these two portals here

545
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,039
you'll be able to see us going back to

546
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,480
you see a kind numeration being

547
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
reconnaissance done and honey token

548
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,160
activity so like if you have connie co

549
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,320
uh honey kinds being performed you can

550
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,520
be able to see um

551
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,360
what like if you have like a honey

552
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,000
account being um set up with in your

553
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,919
organization like who's what's poking at

554
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,280
it or what's sign into it like you can

555
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,720
be able to see like okay there's an

556
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,240
administrator signing on to this like

557
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,919
but are they actually say here they they

558
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,960
say they are no no and um

559
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,440
yeah um

560
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,200
pretty much i go from there and like

561
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,960
what uh

562
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,760
another cool thing about uh the kind of

563
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,160
identity is it helps show the lateral

564
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,240
movement within your organization as

565
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,360
well so

566
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,240
um

567
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,960
like a lot like if without take our uh

568
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,880
attacker you can be able to we want to

569
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
like move them either vertically or

570
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,440
laterally within your environment and

571
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
what um defender of identity helps

572
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,760
displays like what for example within

573
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,960
this users and position within the uh

574
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,520
organization where are they within your

575
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,919
network so laurel movement posts show

576
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,919
like where from like this point to that

577
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,280
point to that point where they related

578
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,000
from and helps build like okay like

579
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,559
set up policies i'd set up high priority

580
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,320
like what like you could see for

581
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,559
sensitivity so like figure out like if

582
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,160
this kind's been like and touched or

583
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,360
like being like

584
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,280
performing suspicious things you may be

585
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,720
able to work on up there and be able to

586
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,320
act on fast in case like there is a

587
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,360
malicious

588
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,280
attacker being touched on and this

589
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,679
really helps like more with um

590
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,120
if an attacker is moving around with

591
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,480
their network you can have better like

592
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,360
like uh a diagram of like where really

593
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,480
is like everything within your

594
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,919
environment because when it's vendor

595
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,360
fighter it gets first set up it has

596
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
these identity sensors like it's stuck

597
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,880
on the the main controllers and just

598
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,320
like from there you can be able to view

599
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,039
all the traffic going back and forth and

600
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,159
it helps like

601
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,000
display like likes timelines for um

602
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,840
what like uh users were signed on with

603
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,440
if there was a brute force attempt like

604
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,480
how many field attempts were within a r

605
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,640
or a given period of time

606
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,600
and

607
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,039
really from there you can just be able

608
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,000
to figure out okay yeah well

609
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,440
um

610
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,280
like how can i uh it's just like gonna

611
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,799
be like a serious that or how can i be

612
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,480
able to remediate this straight away and

613
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,840
just from there you can be able to

614
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,280
reform actions from each of these

615
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,440
different portals like can i just

616
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,000
disable the user's account and this will

617
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,360
sync to the on-premise so they'll be

618
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,000
able to disable their there too

619
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,159
unlike all these portals do we link back

620
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,320
to each other for these sandals so um

621
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,919
for example defender of identity can

622
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,400
communicate with uh clyde apps to if

623
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,240
alert trigger is here and alert triggers

624
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,080
in cloud apps and cloud ups triggers

625
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,159
within sentinel and that's how we are

626
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,720
able to pick up that activity and from a

627
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,440
managed services point of view

628
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,720
and from there it just pretty much

629
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,240
they'll communicate with each other and

630
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,600
one up

631
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,280
and just finally like high kind of like

632
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,159
this i i i really will like

633
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,799
how can we by our with this like with an

634
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,000
instance so

635
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,440
like using all these portals you'll be

636
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
able to correlate evidence and stick it

637
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,280
within like your and zero tickets for

638
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,000
example and from here if an incident

639
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,400
does occur you do have like this

640
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
neatly timelined of events like

641
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
occurring to be able to like just prove

642
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,799
like what like um you'd be able to prove

643
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,159
like a faster time of events from like

644
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,840
the moment like a wardrobe gets set up

645
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,919
and an incident occurs so when did this

646
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,840
when do the alert activities seem like

647
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,600
what like every action did you perform

648
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,720
like when

649
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,880
was the um

650
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,240
when was the malicious attacker like

651
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,960
performing like certain commands or

652
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
uh running malware for example with back

653
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,280
to like a cnc server

654
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,440
and this helps like just establish a

655
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,640
quicker timeline where it's like it

656
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,400
saves them a lot more work and gets like

657
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,520
quicker on the ball with it so eliza i'm

658
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,200
just uh

659
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,840
helping with um the time management of a

660
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,480
of a delicate matter um and soccer

661
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,720
alerts as well can show like initial um

662
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,000
activity as well so going back to

663
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
signing activity this helps like see

664
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,240
like okay this is like maybe an attacker

665
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,679
attempting to sign into the user's

666
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,280
account if they compromise what's the

667
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,960
significance of this account is it

668
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,480
really sensitive or

669
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,919
are they able to like move a bike from

670
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,200
there because once this account's

671
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,880
compromised or like we're about to be

672
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,720
able to do that and you're able to get

673
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,360
on top quickly so like any like as i say

674
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,960
going back to alert like any other can

675
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
like be serious like regardless of like

676
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,840
what priority might be assigned

677
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,679
and on them

678
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,480
like

679
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,080
from like from there like it wants like

680
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,520
you pretty much like as an animal's

681
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,679
point of view you can identify like what

682
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,760
like um actions can be taken like this

683
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,679
helps stop an attacker and stress and

684
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,559
from there i the ir team can help

685
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,720
establish like okay when was the initial

686
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,520
uh point of contact and what like

687
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,720
what else have they done are they still

688
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,559
within that point and just quickly

689
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,240
monitor closely monitored there from

690
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,919
there and this helps just avoid further

691
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,240
damage to the client itself so yeah um

692
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,400
and yeah um that is it uh thank you so

693
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,560
thank you

697
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,069
[Applause]

698
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,679
so any questions

699
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,159
right yes

700
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,679
my most interesting alert um

701
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,919
it was a uh oh that's like that's a good

702
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,240
one actually um

703
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,919
i it wasn't really it was something more

704
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,919
like an interesting it was like a

705
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,840
i find like yeah it was an anti-malware

706
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
action that failed with this

707
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,600
device and it was an old piece of

708
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,200
malware that was found on it they were

709
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,720
like trying to figure out okay well like

710
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,240
it's we're trying to raise with a

711
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,919
customer and like get rid of this file

712
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,320
because defender this device itself

713
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,080
wasn't on board properly so like you

714
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,000
can't run the fender from because like

715
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,520
if it isn't fully on board defender

716
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,960
might not be installed on it you can't

717
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,360
remediate it so we find out yeah we you

718
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,200
just like pass it on and just remediate

719
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,960
it but we find like this other devices

720
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,640
with this old piece of malware we're

721
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,840
starting to show up we're trying to

722
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,679
figure why is this thing showing up so i

723
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,840
did about a digging myself and find like

724
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,640
this

725
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,799
was originated on like a file tip

726
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,559
storage like a really old piece of like

727
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,679
um

728
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,919
uh

729
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,799
hard drive as well and then

730
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,080
what happened was uh it this robocopy on

731
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,120
this nas file shar

732
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,840
sharing server and hot hell i brought

733
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,080
this dormant piece of malware to life i

734
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,960
started

735
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,559
beaming it to all these other endpoints

736
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,480
that were connected to this server and

737
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,600
what happened was just like it just

738
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,720
started alerting all this thing so i

739
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,080
find it quite interesting so i was like

740
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,440
hi get like that thing be just stuck

741
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,120
there for a long time right so yeah

742
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,159
that's that's probably what's probably

743
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,919
most interesting because i did edit the

744
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,760
idea but they learned a lot of stuff by

745
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,520
the way so

746
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,918
any other questions

747
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,799
uh like i mean some of i mentioned like

748
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,720
uh going in the last like i do like

749
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,559
particularly to go with the ir team

750
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,799
itself because like they i find like

751
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,039
even with getting to understand their

752
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,640
engagements because

753
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,200
and with a quorum like if you have a

754
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,039
ticket that is brought up like the high

755
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,039
incident you can

756
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,799
ir can bring you along with that and be

757
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,279
able to gauge okay yeah that's how what

758
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,520
is what is a war room like what was all

759
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,120
these internal different rooms being set

760
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,960
up because i never knew this before

761
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,120
like before my first um engagement like

762
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,279
i was able to like just be out on a call

763
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,520
with a client like the opposite side of

764
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,480
them and just

765
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,000
like shadow and just gain a lot of

766
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,279
experience like just gain some

767
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,360
experience that way um

768
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,279
and so like i just have to develop an

769
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,799
interest for irf out there and just

770
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,480
because i'm i'm going back to what i

771
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,799
like i like forensics and like the just

772
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,640
the forensic aspect is where i know i

773
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,840
like to be staying in so

774
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,799
any other questions

775
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,000
um we yeah we use uh other tools as well

776
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,120
but um it's more just for we we can use

777
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,279
like other open source tools as well so

778
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,960
you can have typically like like sort of

779
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,039
ip info to look up like ips as well

780
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,159
because sentinel helps you um

781
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,200
this is like a general thing with

782
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,320
microsoft where it could have

783
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,039
pinpoint like the geolocation of what an

784
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,279
ips registry right but sometimes it is

785
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,640
it is a bit of an issue in the past

786
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,080
where they may missed you configure like

787
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,240
in ip so like i always like double check

788
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,559
anyway like to vip info to figure out

789
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,799
like what's the ips location is it a

790
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,720
registered is it a tour address is it a

791
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,960
vpn drive for example and this helps

792
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,080
like just like

793
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,520
building up that information as well

794
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,080
likes of them a url scan as well like

795
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,480
you can scan urls as well before without

796
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,080
actually having to actually investigate

797
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,919
yourself within a part-time finishing

798
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,760
and it's like that that like website is

799
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,960
so good for showing you all the

800
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,480
redirects if you're not if you're like

801
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,000
really like starting off you're unsure

802
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,480
like what is contained within it and it

803
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,760
shows even shows you like example

804
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,240
screenshots for example of like what the

805
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,080
the file leads to or it can even give

806
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,600
you a recommendation of what google's

807
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,679
safe rising gives it to so like is it

808
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,600
malicious or is it clean

809
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,240
so yeah

810
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,880
um it just it really um

811
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,450
defender of identity is more

812
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,279
[Music]

813
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,760
it really depends like what way the uh

814
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,840
the organization itself sets up on-prem

815
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,360
but not

816
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,200
a exact

817
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,120
not exactly it's it's just

818
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,880
essentially like defender of identity

819
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,039
communicates with the on-prem itself so

820
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,320
anything happen on there like you can

821
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,559
see essentially with all that traffic

822
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,480
there it's not more you can't

823
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,520
i'm not entirely sure like on enforcing

824
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
mfa there i know you can

825
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,080
disable the account and

826
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,440
be able to just like disable the

827
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,279
accessions as well remotely from here

828
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,200
forcing mfa i'm not actually too sure

829
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,399
about um

830
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,639
on that

831
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,520
any other questions

832
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,799
quick

833
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,430
[Applause]
