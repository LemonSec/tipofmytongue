1
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,160
this is strangely more disconnected than

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,679
doing this

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,320
to students and remote lectures which is

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,480
a bit odd

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,480
i suppose if anyone's getting questions

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,440
during

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,720
during the talk

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,240
um if you want to just put it in the

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,480
chat here because i'll keep open

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,160
otherwise a little bit of time for

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,240
questions

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,560
and otherwise i'll just

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,159
so uh hopefully obviously

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,000
a decent number of people there

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,200
uh

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,079
i

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,840
i think the last time i did this was

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,640
actually

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,960
in person

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,680
not this talk actually so the talk is on

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,200
friends considerations for the high

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
efficiency image style format i'll talk

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,760
about what that actually is in a second

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,079
so i'm hoping some people at least will

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,160
have heard of what this is

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
uh but we'll kind of go through a little

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,719
bit detail uh but i'm just introducing

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,800
myself quickly i'm uh sean cuon i'm a

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,359
lecturer at ed bernice university so

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,280
obviously been doing the sort of zoom uh

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,520
online stuff for a couple of years now

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,040
so this isn't a

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,640
new experience for me but if you want to

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,320
get in touch i'll have my twitter and

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,000
email down at the bottom it's the whole

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,240
talk so you don't have to

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,320
you know pay much attention to that just

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,520
be on the slides as we go forward

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,280
so i should probably mention that this

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,320
is uh taken from a source paper so this

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,680
is actually just a modified version of

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,840
the talk that i gave at this conference

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,520
roughly the start of the pandemic give

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,400
or take

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,240
so it's really available paper's really

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,520
available you can either google the

47
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,320
title of this talk or the paper as is

48
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,360
there

49
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,920
and you'll find an archive link or the

50
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,640
pdf on napier dc uk

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,240
and if you can't find any of those just

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,600
feel free to email me i can send you a

53
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,720
copy

54
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,000
uh because the whole point of this is

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,280
that we want to disseminate this

56
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,200
information make sure everyone's able to

57
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,040
get to it so

58
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,799
if you guys are serving up the slides

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,399
afterwards i can send mustard as well

60
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,479
right so why am i talking about

61
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,479
and that's how they like to have their

62
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,640
products so we can also enter the sea

63
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,800
for heat which doesn't sound quite as

64
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,760
nice to me but let's go with it for now

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,840
so as you're probably aware of jpeg

66
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,959
zones

67
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,280
you might not be aware of how old is uh

68
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,560
1992 is when the standard by wallace the

69
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,400
original paper was actually produced

70
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,040
so it's uh it's very long tooth

71
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,520
especially for the sort of internet era

72
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,440
so in 1982

73
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,080
yeah things were low resolution and

74
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,599
geocities was a thing and everything

75
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,080
looked awful and jpeg has

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,000
done quite well to age as well as it has

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,360
i think

78
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,599
but fundamentally it's lacking support

79
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,040
for modern things so hdr

80
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
might be the thing in the movies

81
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,800
potentially it wasn't it wasn't a thing

82
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,040
for image file formats back then so hdr

83
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,959
wasn't really considered and it's not

84
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,239
really something that's been bolted onto

85
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,959
jpeg sensitive uh we've also only looked

86
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,440
at the 8-bit color depth so we've not

87
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,720
got you know all the colors of the

88
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,239
rainbow as it were things like

89
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,159
transparency you probably realize if

90
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,440
you've ever tried to make a transparent

91
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,360
image you have to stick with into png

92
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
and the same thing for animation

93
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
jpeg doesn't do that you need things

94
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,560
like apng or gif or gif depending on

95
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,720
which of the sides you're on with how to

96
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
pronounce that

97
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,400
but one thing you've probably noticed if

98
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
you've been around on the internet since

99
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
the 90s is the cheap pick looks awful

100
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,080
particularly low resolutions just

101
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,000
blocking messes once you actually zoom

102
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,200
in

103
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,000
so

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,440
when you compare to the more modern

105
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,640
formats

106
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,239
it doesn't really hold up very well

107
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,799
either in terms of compression

108
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,760
uh reduction of size or in terms of the

109
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,360
artifacts or in terms of the features

110
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,120
like we just talked about there

111
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,400
and it's no surprise there's actually

112
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,519
been a bunch of opportunities let's say

113
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,560
to to get rid of of jpeg and uh only

114
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
eight years after jpeg was released jpeg

115
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,760
2000 that says jeff gpf it's meant to be

116
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,720
jpeg

117
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,200
jpeg 2000 was a thing

118
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,000
and it never really took off so it's

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
objectively better in every way than

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
jpeg from 1992

121
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,519
but it just never went anywhere the

122
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,280
support never really gained enough

123
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,680
traction to replace jpeg properly

124
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,519
and we've seen this time again things

125
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,840
like bpg which i think stands for better

126
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,759
portable graphics which similar kind of

127
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,320
name to png actually webp which is

128
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,560
google's formats you've probably seen in

129
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,840
fact the background that i downloaded

130
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,160
for this talk was yp when i got off the

131
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,240
internet so that definitely isn't you

132
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,040
somewhere just not very often

133
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,960
and you've probably not heard of jpeg xt

134
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,720
and a bunch of the other jpeg

135
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,040
formats that tried to replace jpeg or

136
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,560
they're trying to develop standards that

137
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,160
were placed just now

138
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,800
and avif but one of the common themes

139
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,720
for the latter ones

140
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,479
is that they're typically using

141
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,919
the uh codecs that are meant for video

142
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,080
and video actually encodes still still

143
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
images effectively as a keyframes so

144
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,759
because video technology's actually

145
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,120
we've done quite a lot

146
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,800
even though our stellar standards

147
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,360
haven't then we just kind of borrow

148
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,919
those video still image compression

149
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,039
elements

150
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,520
and that's actually what heath does

151
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,560
so he

152
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,479
was actually it's been around since

153
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,800
2015. it was quite one thing it was

154
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,479
seven years and it's got the file

155
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,199
extension heath or geek so you guys see

156
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,560
at the end

157
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
and it tries to bring in all of these

158
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,240
improvements that we've seen

159
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,759
so if we look in terms of the

160
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,919
compression ratio

161
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,320
it's up to 50 now in practice i haven't

162
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,680
actually seen that

163
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,280
and a test as you can see on the right

164
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,919
hand side i took a pair of damage of our

165
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,919
reasonable resolution which was about

166
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,199
five megabytes and converted to jpeg

167
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,800
and you'll see that the version

168
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
definitely is smaller

169
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,280
but not not by a huge amount it's not

170
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,720
going to be dramatic in any case but it

171
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,160
does have all the support for all the

172
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,639
hdr stuff that we're talking about

173
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,240
and it's allegedly got fewer artifacts

174
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,400
and it's better quality there's a lot of

175
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,120
arguing about that when uh apple decided

176
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,440
to release that as part of their

177
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,039
ios

178
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,479
so from iphone 7 and whichever the same

179
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
era ipad was on ios 11 right above 2017

180
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,800
apple switched to heath as their default

181
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,080
for camera based images

182
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,560
so you're taking that software taking a

183
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,560
picture

184
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,039
and for

185
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,400
the iphone users we've probably

186
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,960
experienced some grief because of that

187
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,880
like we'll get to the second but that

188
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,479
transition was really the first major

189
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,479
step in getting rid of jpeg in my

190
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,240
opinion is the first time we've seen

191
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,560
something that's really had an adoption

192
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,319
market adoption

193
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,160
and that was a lot of fighting over you

194
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,440
know whether it's actually better not to

195
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,720
look at but one of the benefits is

196
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,199
because it's using these video codecs

197
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,880
it's actually using h.265 or hgbc

198
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,120
to encode the images

199
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
and the burst shots which we'll get to

200
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,479
we can actually use hardware

201
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,560
acceleration so it's just better in

202
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,520
terms of

203
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
being more modern in a lot of different

204
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,000
ways

205
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,360
so the problem really is the software

206
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,639
support

207
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,599
so it is improving and since i wrote the

208
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,440
paper in 2020 or since it was published

209
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,840
in 2020 i can imagine things got a bit

210
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,759
better but i keep checking

211
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,919
and it doesn't seem to be getting better

212
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,919
you might expect especially given that

213
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,759
apple has taken on

214
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,560
as a sort of large-scale adoption

215
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,680
so

216
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,120
quite often

217
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,599
the advice has been to export

218
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,840
to jpeg if you want to send it to other

219
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,120
devices

220
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,400
so you've probably seen if your iphone

221
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,520
is you've probably seen articles like

222
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,240
this

223
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,000
where it's saying oh uh just just

224
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,240
exported to jk or here's how you export

225
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,720
it to jpeg as part of ios 11 for 12 or

226
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,560
13 words

227
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,879
and this article i'm screenshotting here

228
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,039
is actually from 2020 so

229
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,800
three years after apple adopted it this

230
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,400
was still a thing

231
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,080
and it probably still is i'm not an

232
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,319
iphone user myself

233
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,599
so unfortunately this same advice i

234
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,280
found in quite a lot of forensics books

235
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,960
now i don't want to name them because

236
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,360
that's not really the point but

237
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,199
even the forensics tooling the forensics

238
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,240
and uh

239
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,400
blogs and companies that are doing this

240
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,319
for a living didn't really have much of

241
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,000
a better solution at the time which is

242
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,120
really what inspired me to write the

243
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,879
paper

244
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,879
so i noticed there's just not generally

245
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,280
a good understanding of the format

246
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,879
this includes forensic circles and

247
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,319
anyone that's done any forensics will

248
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,000
know that knowing how things are

249
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
constructed is actually half the battle

250
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,960
you know if you want to do a browser

251
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,720
forensics then you probably want to

252
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
either have a good tool for it or be

253
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,120
able to go through sqlite databases same

254
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,559
thing with mobile forensics if the tool

255
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,000
doesn't support it then fundamentally

256
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,159
you're looking at sqlite databases or

257
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,799
xml files you know it pays to understand

258
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,760
how these things are structured

259
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,680
so most of the papers were on

260
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,440
compression and media formats and

261
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
features so it's more to do with the

262
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,279
encoding rather than

263
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,440
how does this work in terms of forensic

264
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,800
artifacts

265
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,120
so i thought i want to remedy that

266
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,959
and there were some forensics blog posts

267
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,480
in fact one of the ones i referenced in

268
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,720
the paper is cheeky monkey foreign

269
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,080
a conference paper with a reference to

270
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,760
cheeky monkey for instance's blog which

271
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,640
i thought was a new career high

272
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,399
but yeah it's uh it's actually not about

273
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,600
post so

274
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,480
it's quite funny monkey msp drawings so

275
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,040
yeah go it's good stuff

276
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560
so the investigation of the paper is

277
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,839
basically saying this is all bad news we

278
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,360
need to do better than this

279
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,040
as a as a friends community

280
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,120
so again why do we care about this well

281
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,800
if that wasn't convincing enough well we

282
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
just have to look at the market share

283
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,519
that apple actually has for ios devices

284
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,360
so worldwide

285
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,959
we're sitting at about

286
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,399
you know a sort of

287
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,560
three three-quarters android although

288
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,399
it's been diminishing every year since i

289
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,320
started keeping track of this and ios is

290
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,920
a bit more than a quarter but if you

291
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,959
look specifically at the sort of main

292
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,040
english speaking markets in the usa and

293
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,959
the uk it's actually a bit more like 50

294
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,080
50.

295
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,120
so i probably should have checked this

296
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
for the wrong paper because i said

297
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,560
basically if you're doing

298
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,959
mobile forensics about 20 of the

299
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,560
investigations at the time would have

300
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,000
been ios

301
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
but in fact if you do meet in britain or

302
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
the usa it's far more than that it's

303
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,920
more than double that

304
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,120
so we definitely have to know how these

305
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,560
things work

306
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
and one of the problems is really that

307
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,640
we've moved away from

308
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,040
the still image format just being about

309
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,560
a single image

310
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,519
so this is one of the things you might

311
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,120
not realize with key format is actually

312
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,279
a container where we can put multiple

313
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,800
images inside

314
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,519
so

315
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,480
the as i said it takes the codec from

316
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,880
video encoding but actually it borrows

317
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,240
more than that is following the

318
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,279
structure

319
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,480
of a video

320
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,320
format a video file format to be

321
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,360
specific

322
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,600
so we look at all the way back to the

323
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,920
quicktime quicktime movie format

324
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,680
everything is sort of derived from that

325
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,640
all the sort of mp4 mkv containers

326
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,560
they're all just that they're containers

327
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,399
because if you think about

328
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,320
and this is maybe showing my energy but

329
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,120
if you think about like a dvd menu right

330
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,320
you've got all these different tracks

331
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,360
you've got different chapters for the

332
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,079
film you've got the extras you've got

333
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,079
different audio and language settings

334
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,839
you can go to the one where they

335
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,079
they have the commentary on top right

336
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,279
these are all effectively different

337
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,800
channels

338
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,079
for the same

339
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,839
related content

340
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,360
so video formats have to deal with that

341
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,560
for quite a long time but now we're

342
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,640
getting to the point where images

343
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,440
are not just a single picture anymore

344
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,360
so you can think of a containerized

345
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,120
image format is basically

346
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,680
a gallery in a file so we're not storing

347
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
a single image and something like with

348
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,839
jpeg we're storing a sequence of images

349
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,680
or a series of related images that we

350
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,240
can then do stuff

351
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,600
and the trick here is that when you're

352
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200
displaying that

353
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,480
we're typically going to display the

354
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,320
cover images like so that's like the the

355
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,920
book cover you know there's loads of

356
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,600
pages in sight there might be more

357
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,120
images inside but we only really see the

358
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,720
cover

359
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,920
that's the main thing that you want to

360
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,160
display is tagged as the primary image

361
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,279
in youth

362
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,800
so there are actually multiple what we

363
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,399
call master images

364
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,279
so

365
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,040
like source images if you like and

366
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,320
there's also potentially a bunch of

367
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
derived images which are actually as

368
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,399
then it suggests derived from one or

369
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,959
more master images

370
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,560
and we've got multiple sequences so if

371
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
you think about sort of live images you

372
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,079
can take on phones these days or the

373
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,519
brush sequences hold them the camera

374
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,279
snapshot button right take a brush to

375
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,600
move it right that's the sequence and

376
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,279
that has a specific encoding we have to

377
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,200
take care of in this kind of format as

378
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,800
well but we've got more than that as

379
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,600
well so if you're thinking about

380
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,800
traditional image strategies then we're

381
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
looking at things like exit data

382
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,880
or maybe we've got thumbnails

383
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,120
embedded and the thing is for every one

384
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,760
of these master images is embedded

385
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,720
they can have separate exit content or

386
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,040
they can have individual thumbnails

387
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,120
so we've actually got not just a couple

388
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,720
of images but we've got a bunch of

389
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,000
attached information to those images

390
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,839
and as we'll see the support for that

391
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,000
and actually dealing with that is not

392
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,760
good at all

393
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,519
so most applications don't seem more

394
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,360
than that just that coverage that big

395
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,680
cover if you like and that includes the

396
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,839
conversion utilities so all this advice

397
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,760
saying convert it to jpeg and then do

398
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,440
your analysis there well all you're

399
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,360
really doing is converting that cover

400
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,240
image down what you want to be displayed

401
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,600
and nothing else you lose the rest of

402
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,760
that content and that information

403
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,959
in fact i'll just go back to this a

404
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,560
second so what we're seeing on the right

405
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,920
hand side here

406
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,880
is

407
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,560
the fact can i

408
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,639
turn on the pointer is that might be

409
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,000
more helpful

410
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,040
so hopefully you can see the laser

411
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,200
pointer and capturing uh let me know if

412
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,279
not so we've got

413
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,680
the mac preview application being

414
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,760
displayed here and basically we've got

415
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,440
an image or heath

416
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,079
container if you like that's got one two

417
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,320
three four separate images of different

418
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,720
seasons allegedly and then we've got our

419
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,639
fifth image which actually combines them

420
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,720
all together into a bridge format so the

421
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,079
thing we're seeing displayed in the main

422
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,639
pane here is that bright combination of

423
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,480
the four master images

424
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
so if i was displaying that in most

425
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,760
applications i would only see the

426
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,920
support right here i wouldn't actually

427
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,600
really get access to the individual

428
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,920
images that are comprising that

429
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,720
grid

430
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,560
itself

431
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,320
so that's you know i might not think

432
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,560
that's a big deal right now

433
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,839
but not having access to those

434
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,440
individual images might be a problem for

435
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,000
trying to do proper analysis

436
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,160
and if you take that a bit further

437
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
then one of the things is

438
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,920
you can actually tile images together so

439
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,600
not just in that sort of grid combine

440
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,720
them together into a big collage like

441
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,199
apple actually makes use of this just to

442
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,959
store their images normally

443
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,720
so i tested this out i had a friend

444
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
who's had like an iphone whatever

445
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,800
maximum plus you know one of these like

446
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,480
golds i think it literally was a gold

447
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,160
phone for

448
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,680
nothing he wanted the gold version

449
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,760
specifically he was doing it again

450
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,279
and they sent me some images over and i

451
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,440
had a look at it and basically what is

452
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,240
happening is they're taking 512 pixel

453
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,199
blocks

454
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,480
and they're combining them together into

455
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,800
a big grid

456
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,600
five minute warning code here and that

457
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,920
print is what is actually displayed

458
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,279
so there's tens of some entities

459
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,880
depending on the resolution

460
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,639
that depends on the phone we're taking

461
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,480
with so derived images are really

462
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,160
important because they're actually you

463
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,079
know quite strongly liked

464
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,680
the time before

465
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,240
they're quite strongly linked to the uh

466
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,920
you know the very nature of the whole

467
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,000
thing so the right hand side you can see

468
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,519
there's other forms we've got alpha

469
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,040
blends so you can take two master images

470
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,639
blend them together into this sort of

471
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,560
nice combination of the two

472
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,480
but we need to figure out how to display

473
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,079
that how to render that how to deal with

474
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,440
that

475
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,720
so the right languages are combining

476
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,320
things together and you can do that in a

477
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,920
bunch of different ways but the

478
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,279
fundamental thing is you need a

479
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,040
mechanism to do that

480
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,720
so for the the blending for example

481
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,240
there's actually a third component we're

482
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,959
missing here which is the alpha mask

483
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,199
so how do i know which pixels to blend

484
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,480
from each image well i just have a

485
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,040
bitmap it tells me with ones or zeros or

486
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,880
something in between how much of each of

487
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,240
the ones to show

488
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,320
so that's actually a third hidden image

489
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,240
of the alpha mask and we can do the same

490
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,600
thing with depth of field so we've got

491
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,120
depth mask which we can apply which is

492
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,800
actually more likely what you're going

493
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,120
to see with apple

494
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,160
know you've got that sort of portrait

495
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,000
mode where you take the depth of field

496
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,600
image

497
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,000
so these auxiliary images aren't even

498
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,839
displayed in

499
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,759
any of the tools that i've used so mac

500
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,040
preview doesn't show them they're not

501
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,839
really viewable you can't see them but

502
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:22,959
the problem is that could be used to

503
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,519
encode other information right

504
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,759
so if i've just got an alpha mask that

505
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,959
could actually be just a different image

506
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,720
that could just be a bit that knowledge

507
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,240
and if i really wanted to i could have

508
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,519
three of those and i could have them

509
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,759
represent different rgb channels combine

510
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,480
them later on in social image

511
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,000
but we wouldn't really be able to notice

512
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
it without proper analysis tools

513
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,959
can run over great things

514
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,720
right so this gives us a bit of abuse

515
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,480
potential because we can now use these

516
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
auxiliary images we can't actually

517
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,320
really display it properly at the moment

518
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
as a carrier so we think about it in

519
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,240
terms of steganography

520
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,360
or just

521
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,320
any kind of data hiding coding this is

522
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,400
now this sort of grayscale illuminance

523
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
channel that never really gets displayed

524
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,480
anywhere and if we're subtle about it

525
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,839
you wouldn't even be able to notice it

526
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,000
even if you're using that in an alpha

527
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,559
blend or a depth of field blend so it

528
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,640
just gives us additional channels

529
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,199
that are not really up for analysis in

530
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,720
the same way we'd really thought of

531
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,039
image transits

532
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,160
so what does it look like on windows

533
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,599
i've showed you a couple of previews of

534
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,599
what it looks like on mac

535
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,960
windows

536
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,720
typically looks like this you try and

537
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,280
open the image and uh yeah it just says

538
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,120
we can the photos application in

539
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,480
particular has a lot of trouble with

540
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,520
this

541
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,679
however you might see that it is

542
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,320
rendering the thumbnail view in explorer

543
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,160
so the grid version on the left hand

544
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,960
side of this is

545
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,360
[Music]

546
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
which is just a different combinations

547
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,240
it's a different

548
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,960
setup for deriving a derived image

549
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,120
it doesn't display at all right so on

550
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,799
windows it's kind of tricky there's a

551
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,400
bunch of plugins you have to have some

552
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,679
of them are paid

553
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,600
it's just a bit of a mess right so even

554
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,440
though windows does support this

555
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,240
it doesn't support this out of the box

556
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,080
right it's still a bit of a mess even

557
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,440
two years after writing that original

558
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
paper

559
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,520
uh android does support it but again it

560
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,360
doesn't really have that full support we

561
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,480
hope

562
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,600
so one of the other things we can do

563
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,679
here as well is have lossless editing so

564
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,600
you take the original image and you chop

565
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,120
off some bits and normally what happens

566
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
is once you've made that edit

567
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,480
you don't get access to the original

568
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,240
data it's gone right

569
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,520
but if

570
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,840
all it does is it gives you a different

571
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,440
aperture for viewing that image so the

572
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,880
rest of that data is still present in

573
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,280
the file

574
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,480
it's just not presented

575
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,919
so what actually happens is the

576
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,440
modifications of keith you can do them

577
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,640
in real time

578
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,280
at display time and the player

579
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,720
players that technically use the

580
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,039
documentation is the thing that does

581
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,880
that problem

582
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,559
and this applies to rotate mirror and

583
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,559
crop which are we call lossless edits

584
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,400
for the original image is still there

585
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,160
you just might not be able to see it

586
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,679
because again our feeling isn't quite

587
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,840
there and a requirement of a complete

588
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,280
heave player is that you do all these

589
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,840
things

590
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,960
losslessly so it's not so much a problem

591
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,400
right now you can imagine situations

592
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,160
where like the illegal part of the image

593
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,679
is cropped out if you don't have the

594
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,200
tools to see that that's a bit of a

595
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,039
problem

596
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,880
however last time i checked apple isn't

597
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,200
supporting the lossless editing but so

598
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,360
much but you can use it you can't

599
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,910
generate these using apis

600
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,240
[Music]

601
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,600
so in the future

602
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,120
the cover image might not really be

603
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,559
representative

604
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,320
for apple devices either

605
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
but you can still generate these images

606
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,400
and there's a github link in the paper

607
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,840
you can generate these images using the

608
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,320
api as i mentioned in that paper

609
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,000
and if you just look this is what i just

610
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,200
looked at

611
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,120
just earlier before the talk

612
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,559
if you look at it in it still

613
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,679
doesn't let you see the rest of the

614
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,120
image you're still only seeing that

615
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,039
segment of it so even a tool that has

616
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,880
decent support for heath

617
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,160
doesn't give you the full image it only

618
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,840
gives you that cropped segment that the

619
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,720
player

620
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,640
is representing so the rest of that

621
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,840
image is still there in the fireworks

622
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,399
can't see it

623
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,960
and to make matters worse we can hide

624
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,440
things so i'll increase speed a little

625
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,480
bit just to get through this but

626
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,600
basically

627
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,840
just as the auxiliary images those

628
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,080
bitmaps those depth maps

629
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,440
aren't visible by default it can

630
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,880
actually flag things to be hidden

631
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,640
specifically so we look on the right

632
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,159
hand side this is actually a first shot

633
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,000
there's a few preview images and i

634
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,760
flipped one bit

635
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,200
that basically told the player not to

636
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,000
display one of those

637
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,000
and i'm just going through this so a

638
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,120
single bit

639
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,200
in the in the information box basically

640
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,559
just said don't display this none of the

641
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,640
players actually get around that they

642
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,360
all just do what that bit says

643
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,960
so the lack of frenzy still is a big

644
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,240
deal here because i can hide all the

645
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
illegal stuff just display the behind

646
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,520
things

647
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,440
and not be any the wiser because the

648
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,520
tooling isn't there

649
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,520
and oddly he can actually refer to files

650
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,320
outside as well it's got a url

651
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,000
data field which i think is supposedly

652
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,360
for exit

653
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,440
you can see how pointing external data

654
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,640
could have security issues but also just

655
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,679
be a bit of a pain to analyze generally

656
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,039
there's no support as far as you can see

657
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,000
for any of this stuff and the only way

658
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,600
to get all the information for

659
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,679
birthshots that

660
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,120
and export and that gives you just a

661
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,720
list of all the keyframes as well

662
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,559
so how does this apply for hashing well

663
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,720
hashing is an issue because

664
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,240
cryptographic hashing is meant for

665
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,320
identifying legal content that's usually

666
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,480
meant for identifying exact things so

667
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,080
there's a bunch of semantic things in

668
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,360
approximate matching which i thought

669
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,799
about the lectures but we don't really

670
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,080
want to get into that

671
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,760
but if it's looking for exact things

672
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,679
we've got container

673
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,000
well that's kind of one image in one

674
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,520
thumbnail

675
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,960
but if you've got a container like

676
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,280
format like eve that's about

677
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,799
hashing a zip file you know we don't

678
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,200
even move around things in that zip file

679
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,039
we can add them to the zip file you can

680
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,280
change the order of things so hashing

681
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,480
the whole thing

682
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,240
isn't necessarily that useful unless we

683
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,280
just want to identify that whole

684
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,120
container we're not identifying

685
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,960
individual elements at that point so i

686
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
flip things around i add new items that

687
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,320
hash breaks

688
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,840
and we also have to bear in mind that

689
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,600
for brush shots the images are recorded

690
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,840
like videos recorded

691
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,120
effectively between the frames

692
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,200
so if you add in an extra frame or

693
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,640
remove some frames then we're going to

694
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,320
again change the whole binary sequence

695
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,039
which is a problem for action fits

696
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,559
so ideally we need to do something a bit

697
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,600
more clever

698
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,880
maybe involving hatching all the

699
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,039
subframes so use that event export

700
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,080
individual keyframes and hashtags

701
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,559
so i'll go through the layout just

702
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,080
uh really briefly

703
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,360
in fact i'll skip over this if you want

704
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
to know more about this look at the

705
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,120
have a look at the paper basically

706
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
because it's a complicated format it's

707
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,679
kind of all in place right

708
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,520
uh you've got a lot of different ways of

709
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,039
encoding this information a lot of

710
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,720
different combinations and basically

711
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,159
there's nothing that's going to look at

712
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,600
all these different boxes right there's

713
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,280
tons of stuff in there it's a lot more

714
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,880
complicated than jpeg is

715
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,400
i'll skip over this as well but

716
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,840
basically the point of this is for

717
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,440
software support

718
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,280
it's just not there so if you look at

719
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,960
this and again this is the paper i don't

720
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,000
really want to cover this i was just

721
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
throwing in to show you that is

722
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,080
pretty good support for still images

723
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,559
not for the first shots ffmpeg doesn't

724
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,240
really do still images it does quite

725
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,320
well at birth shots but all of the other

726
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,480
things i looked at really hit miss you

727
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,919
know a lot of them don't really cover

728
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,320
even the master images for them

729
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,520
and they just don't handle worse

730
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,760
sequences at all so you really need to

731
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,520
pick your balance here when using the

732
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,559
tilling

733
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,080
so given

734
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,760
all of the sort of lack of support i

735
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,039
found

736
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,000
basically the the analysis approach i'm

737
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,159
suggesting is have a look at the header

738
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,279
if you see

739
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,200
anything that looks like this it's a

740
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,360
file actually just says like

741
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,919
um f-type geek or mif1 heat right so you

742
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,679
could just read that out and then we see

743
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,039
the picture part and that tells us it's

744
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,120
actually still images of picture we want

745
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,640
to check for the box structure which you

746
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,960
just do by looking at strings

747
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,320
and the main reason there is we want to

748
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
see if there's any derived images so if

749
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,159
we just jump back really quickly we can

750
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,320
see here that that says green right and

751
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,600
that means that there's a grid and you

752
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,039
can see there's a bunch of individual

753
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,600
boxes with the individual master images

754
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,760
so that tells us how many pictures are

755
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,279
actually in that image even if you can't

756
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,600
see them all of our tools

757
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,720
and then we want to check there's a

758
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,159
specific bit again you can check in the

759
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,760
paper there's a specific bit the mark

760
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,159
since it's hidden so we want to unhide

761
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,960
those flipping that bit

762
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,720
and then you can preview it in lag or

763
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,880
 and it's a video we want to export

764
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,440
using ffmpeg and that gives us at least

765
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,279
for now the best shot at seeing

766
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,679
everything inside that container because

767
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,279
really the tooling just still isn't

768
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,559
there

769
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,159
so conclusions

770
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,480
is a complicated container format it's

771
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,320
not really a still image format in the

772
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,600
old sense or png or jpeg

773
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,679
current phrasing skills not good you

774
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:54,640
actually have to do quite a lot of

775
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,080
manual work if you really want to find

776
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,320
out what's inside this files

777
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,360
and

778
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,440
future forensics tools should really

779
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,200
display the box structure in the item

780
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,320
structure because remember it can be

781
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,520
complicated the arrangement of

782
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,360
thumbnails and exit data you want to be

783
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,760
able to completely unpack that you want

784
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,360
to be able to display the hidden items

785
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,679
that includes the auxiliary depth map

786
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,840
things sequences of frames all that

787
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,200
except data

788
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,159
we want to be able to hash the

789
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,080
individual elements which again

790
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,159
uh because it's a container format

791
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,919
there's no point hashing the whole zip

792
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,080
file we want to see what's inside of it

793
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,679
and we want to attempt to address things

794
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,200
like external references and some of the

795
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,919
other weird behavior that's in there

796
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,360
so if you want to know more there's the

797
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,679
specifications in the iso documents iso

798
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,240
bmf and iso keith

799
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,080
uh they'll probably also read stylus

800
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,760
which is why i wrote this paper but the

801
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,520
full paper like i said is easily

802
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,039
available online

803
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,240
so uh

804
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,480
i think i'll wrap up there i know that

805
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,440
the time is pushed a little bit

806
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,720
so i don't have a good time for

807
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,320
questions or not but if you want to ask

808
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,679
me a question feel free to hit me up on

809
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,480
twitter

810
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,559
so uh that's the little one there and my

811
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,480
email address is at the bottom if you're

812
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,919
if you're interested in

813
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,960
following up a bit on that

814
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,640
does anyone have any questions

815
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,080
so i don't know if we've got 10 for any

816
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,279
questions or

817
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,080
should we just wrap up

818
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,279
two seconds

819
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,159
i should probably point out there's a

820
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,360
couple of apis and the the best overall

821
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,960
is this uh i think it was a master's

822
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,440
paper a master's thesis actually at the

823
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,120
moment implementation

824
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,799
for the format

825
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,880
and then it's just it's a really useful

826
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,080
document

827
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,679
for working through this and apple also

828
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,120
have a bunch of videos on stuff which is

829
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,520
quite useful for the developers

830
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,880
usually the 2017 uh wwe dc is the best

831
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,919
one but i think they've been a few cents

832
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,679
how difficult is it to write metadata

833
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,520
files well that assumes that you've got

834
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,279
tools that can actually parse the format

835
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,279
and allow you to edit that stuff

836
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,440
so the editors for it were few and far

837
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,919
between uh most of the stuff including

838
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:08,799


839
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,880
is really working with a limited set in

840
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,559
fact i didn't even see a good way of

841
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,120
viewing the except data on editing

842
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,440
now obviously you can just get out

843
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,679
get a hex editor and you can find the

844
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,240
except blocks and you can do whatever

845
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,919
you like with that

846
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,000
but in terms of having tooling to do it

847
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
or even viewing it's not really there so

848
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,840
if you take exit tool and you point at a

849
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,279
heat image that has

850
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,679
four images in the auto exit you will

851
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,360
see precisely one of those you'll see

852
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,000
whichever one is marked as the cover

853
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,320
so the whole thing is just about over

854
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,799
the place like if you edit it

855
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,919
people probably won't even know this

856
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,159
because they won't see it

857
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,640
if that makes sense
