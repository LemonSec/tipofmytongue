1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,920
okay can you all hear me

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,960
alrighty

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,320
so i wanted to give this talk for a

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,559
while uh i was going to give it in first

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,320
year as a

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,040
workshop so i'm happy to finally give it

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,919
in some kind of form

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,080
okay click it's not working

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,119
okay so before we begin a couple things

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,320
i'd like to

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,199
say

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,558
so we got less than an hour so

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,000
i can only cover a fraction of what

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,399
there is to know and for that reason

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,160
we'll be focusing very heavily on the

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,480
technical issues but it's very unlikely

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,200
in the case of personal safety that

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,879
the solution will be purely technical

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,719
it's also possible that your privacy

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,360
won't be a secret so

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,480
if you start encrypting your

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,239
communications anybody who's currently

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,760
used dropping on you will know that they

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,039
can no longer read your messages

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,480
and we're also going to talk a wee bit

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,440
about the topic of domestic violence so

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,760
this talk is by no means an alternative

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,280
to seeking help if you are currently

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,799
going through a crisis

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,080
so i've left the link for that as well

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,280
so you don't have to throw all of your

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,000
tech into the nearest body of water

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
you can actually still have nice things

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,439
and by making you aware of the threats

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,759
you can make an informed decision

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,640
about

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,000
how you want to deal with them

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,960
you definitely don't need to do

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,880
everything in this talk

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,920
and

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,240
if you are the victim of a crime

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,320
make sure that you gather evidence of

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,600
that and

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,399
it is often safer to do that when the

45
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,680
evidence is digital

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,560
does anybody know who nadia is

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,479
you might know her better by her band

48
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,119
and art movement riot

49
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,360
she personally offended along with her

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,320
band

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,119
the

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,640
russian government and the russian

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,759
president

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,520
back in 2011

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,479
and ended up on the run she managed a

56
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,600
whole week

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,919
before being captured which is quite

58
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,360
impressive

59
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,319
and

60
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,319
eventually she was caught because one of

61
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,800
her bandmates forgot to use tor

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
we'll talk about tour a bit later

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,959
but what this is an example of is that

64
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,560
the tools that we're going to talk about

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,959
today are not necessarily perfect

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,959
but they can go a long way to keeping

67
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,319
you freer for longer

68
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,040
she was for her first arrest sentenced

69
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,080
or

70
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,840
served two years in jail

71
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,360
so threat modeling is a huge topic we

72
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,040
don't really have time to cover it we

73
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,560
could do a whole hour's talk on threat

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,400
modeling but we'll do some risk analysis

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,879
for four very different groups

76
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,680
public figures uh there's a huge amount

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
of personal information on public

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,599
figures and famous people online you can

79
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,920
google them you can look them up on

80
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,440
wikipedia

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,720
and a lot of that information is

82
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,159
accurate

83
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,319
they also have very motivated and

84
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,560
well-resourced adversaries

85
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,000
but they do have the advantage that

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
generally speaking their physical

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,400
security is very strong

88
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
domestic abuse survivors

89
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,959
are similar in that their adversary is

90
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,200
motivated and all of their personal

91
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,840
information might be known

92
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,519
their adversary's resources are going to

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,560
vary

94
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,080
and their technical abilities are going

95
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,120
to vary but in general

96
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,840
they're likely to put a lot of resources

97
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,440
into their abuse and also even if their

98
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,920
own technical abilities are limited

99
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,080
they're likely to be able to

100
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,959
either

101
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,480
hire somebody with better technical

102
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,319
abilities or collaborate with other

103
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,200
people with technical abilities

104
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,280
the big difference is that domestic

105
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,239
abuse survivors have very very limited

106
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,200
personal security

107
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:56,959
so

108
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,439
activists wherever you are in the world

109
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,360
uh you're very likely to at some point

110
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,439
face a rest and depending on where you

111
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,640
are in the world

112
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,439
uh

113
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,680
it depends how bad that arrest is going

114
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,120
to be for you

115
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,799
in general you can assume that your

116
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,879
devices are going to be seized both the

117
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,159
ones that you have on you and

118
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,439
potentially the ones that you have at

119
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,238
home

120
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,759
so it's probably in your best interest

121
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,519
to make sure that

122
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,880
there's no

123
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,960
harmful evidence on those devices

124
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,040
devices can also be tracked so if you

125
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,680
take your mobile to a demonstration

126
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,520
there's the possibility that the police

127
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,320
can

128
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,759
track that using stingray devices which

129
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,880
emulate

130
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,440
cell towers and can be used to uniquely

131
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,919
identify the devices that were at the

132
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,440
demonstration

133
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,000
even if the police don't actively use

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,919
stingrays at the demonstration there's a

135
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,240
fair chance that they can still subpoena

136
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,560
your cell carrier to share the

137
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,360
information about your location

138
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,199
retroactively

139
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,919
because your cell carrier is always

140
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,759
monitoring your location

141
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,840
using cell site data

142
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,840
and

143
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,680
and they'll actually often sell this

144
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,440
data for advertisers as well

145
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,919
finally journalists

146
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,120
a lot of the same issues that we've

147
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,479
already discussed

148
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,919
but the main difference with journalists

149
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,360
and whistleblowers is that they may want

150
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,880
to hide the fact that communication

151
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,919
occurred in the first place

152
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,360
so our first risk is metadata

153
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,720
and we're going to be looking mostly at

154
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,960
images because we share images all the

155
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,600
time and there's a huge amount of

156
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,639
harmful metadata that's stored in them

157
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,080
but images are not the only thing that

158
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,520
store metadata

159
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,840
your pdf files and your office documents

160
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,280
do as well so if you're trying to

161
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,039
anonymously publish something you

162
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,320
probably don't want authorship

163
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,160
information or information about the

164
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,600
hardware and software that you created

165
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,240
the document on

166
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,520
so

167
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,919
metadata and images can involve

168
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,919
your kind of exif data so there's a

169
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,479
bunch of unique ids there's timestamps

170
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,080
so like time and date when the photo was

171
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,479
taken geolocation so they're geotagged

172
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,199
with gps coordinates and

173
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,720
even a whole bunch of information about

174
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,840
the device that took the

175
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,639
photograph

176
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,720
which can even include how like how long

177
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,440
it's been powered on

178
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,319
there's a python open source project uh

179
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,479
called map2 and this is the best way to

180
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,160
wipe the metadata out of all of these

181
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,520
files

182
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,840
so

183
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,280
yeah that includes pdf files audio video

184
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,479
and images

185
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,000
it does not wipe file system metadata

186
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,080
and it does not support heat which we'll

187
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,960
talk about in a minute

188
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,639
your mileage may vary with social media

189
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,759
some of them

190
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,319
may very well delete the metadata but

191
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,560
there's no guarantee that they won't

192
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,479
store the original image and there's no

193
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,000
guarantee that they won't use that

194
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
metadata for their own purposes

195
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,599
so heath is the file format that's been

196
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,639
used

197
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,599
for iphone photos since the iphone 7

198
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,520
and

199
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,560
it

200
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,680
is generally superior to jpeg in every

201
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,319
way but the metadata is effectively

202
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,240
unwipable because it's not supported by

203
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,039
matte

204
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,960
or any other metadata anonymization tool

205
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
that i know of

206
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,280
so my advice is if you want to wipe the

207
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,160
metadata from your iphone images

208
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,400
you have two choices either

209
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,639
convert the images that you want to wipe

210
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,319
to jpeg first

211
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,000
and then

212
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,479
wipe the metadata from the jpeg

213
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,919
or

214
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,800
you can actually store the

215
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,199
images in jpeg format rather than heat

216
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,039
format by going into your camera

217
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,080
settings

218
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,160
and selecting most compatible instead of

219
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,960
most efficient

220
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,639
the conversion can be done with a tool

221
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,960
called image magic and i've given an

222
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,319
example of

223
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,680
another command that you'd use to

224
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,440
convert a

225
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,120
peek file called selfie to jpeg

226
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,720
the conversion will not wipe the

227
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,560
metadata so you'll need to do that

228
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,039
separately

229
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,520
so because heap is superior it allows

230
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,360
you to take higher quality audio and

231
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,560
video or

232
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,879
picture and video so

233
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,479
i'm hoping that at some point somebody

234
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,440
will just add support for heath

235
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,640
to matt

236
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,159
it might even make a good honors project

237
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,640
for someone

238
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,479
at a minimum if you're not going to wipe

239
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,958
any of the metadata you can

240
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,039
at the very least

241
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,320
disable

242
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,480
location access to your camera and then

243
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,640
at least you won't be geo tagging

244
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,959
your photos

245
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,880
so if you were to need to relocate to

246
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,360
australia and you were geotagging with

247
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,279
your location in the gold coast

248
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,560
you might be giving yourself away are we

249
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,560
though

250
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,839
so malka or spy cameras is an issue that

251
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,560
started most likely in south korea

252
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,000
in 97

253
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,240
according to wikipedia

254
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,920
cameras have become really small they've

255
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,600
become inexpensive they've become really

256
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
widely available and you can connect

257
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
them to the internet using wi-fi or

258
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
cellular

259
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,399
which makes them possible to hide in

260
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,399
basically anything

261
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,279
so

262
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,800
my advice to you is whenever you're

263
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,920
staying in any kind of rented

264
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,399
accommodation whether that's a long-term

265
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,519
rental

266
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,000
for your actual accommodation or whether

267
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,839
it's an airbnb or a hotel for a holiday

268
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,320
is actually sweep the room and look for

269
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,519
cameras

270
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,959
what you're really looking for is the

271
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,880
lens it could just be a kind of hole in

272
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,800
various things from

273
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,200
the tissue box to the plastic shroud of

274
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
a smoke detector

275
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
or behind towels

276
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,800
anything that's facing the bed or the

277
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,760
shower

278
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,160
is particularly suspicious

279
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,040
and

280
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,000
if you can't confirm that a hole has a

281
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,839
camera in it you could always take some

282
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,440
electrical tape with you and just plug

283
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,480
the hole with the electrical tape

284
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,880
so if you do happen to find a camera

285
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,360
you should not try to engage the bnb or

286
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,240
the hotel staff because they may then

287
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,800
try to destroy the evidence so capture

288
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,120
your own evidence using photographs and

289
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,000
videos and then contact the police and

290
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,320
take allow them to take custody of the

291
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,200
suspected device

292
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,680
so the devices can work in multiple ways

293
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,079
they could be live streaming straight to

294
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,959
a website or they could be storing their

295
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,920
video

296
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,839
feed to a sd card and then the creepy

297
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,240
person would upload it later

298
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,320
there's a real risk of blackmail so

299
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,880
famous people are at higher risk

300
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,519
because if they know who you are

301
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,040
and if you're in a hotel they probably

302
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,839
have your name and contact details

303
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:08,959
they can

304
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,279
find you on social media on linkedin and

305
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,279
then threaten to reveal

306
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,959
the video that they've captured to your

307
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,239
friends family and colleagues

308
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,720
in south korea they have specialized

309
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,959
equipment to track them track the radio

310
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,959
signals from the devices but it doesn't

311
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,120
seem to be particularly effective

312
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,959
so i'm not sure how much of a deterrent

313
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,720
it actually is

314
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,040
and women in south korea are

315
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,360
disproportionately targeted

316
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,000
but nobody's immune to this

317
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,279
stacy dooley did a documentary on

318
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,200
malka in south korea so if you're

319
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,560
interested in that topic that's worth

320
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,959
the watch

321
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,399
so we're blowing the lines away but

322
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,399
between physical and digital

323
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,200
but

324
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,399
facial recognition is generally

325
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,600
something that happens in the physical

326
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,920
world but most of the issues are with

327
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,240
the long-term storage of your

328
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,200
face

329
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,399
on digital media

330
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,720
so there are a couple of different

331
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,639
varieties of it live facial recognition

332
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,959
has been deployed in london in a limited

333
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,959
number of cameras according to the mat

334
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,720
and they use it for targeted

335
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,399
surveillance of people to actually track

336
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,160
people in real time

337
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,000
in other places it's actually illegal so

338
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,880
in

339
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,720
california for example the police can't

340
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,160
wear them on their body cams

341
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,600
so i'm not quite sure how effective that

342
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,959
makeup is

343
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,920
in

344
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,320
hiding your face from facial recognition

345
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,440
but

346
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,240
it definitely looks cool and the makeup

347
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,560
artist mimi is over on instagram and jan

348
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,680
is the cso at brave

349
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,920
so finally

350
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,079
it's also in airport arrivals and

351
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,399
you might be able to opt out but

352
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,160
if you do you're very likely to have to

353
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,959
identify yourself to border guards

354
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,240
personally

355
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,160
so the advantage with facial recognition

356
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,079
is uh during a pandemic it is

357
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,839
contactless

358
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,839
and there's an ongoing effort to work

359
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,720
around masks because mouth and nose are

360
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,040
particularly distinctive and relied on

361
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,639
for a lot of the accurate facial

362
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,160
recognition

363
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,680
and iphones from the iphone 12 onwards

364
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,200
can unlock

365
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,800
using your face even when you're wearing

366
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,720
a mask but they can mostly only get away

367
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,839
with this because they're not trying to

368
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,920
uniquely identify you they're just

369
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,120
trying to make sure that there's a

370
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,079
reasonable chance in a crowd of people

371
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,279
that you're the only one who's going to

372
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,600
be able to unlock your phone

373
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,160
identical twins cause a really serious

374
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,600
problem to

375
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,720
all facial recognition

376
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,959
so shoulder surfers are people who look

377
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,639
over your shoulder

378
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,880
to try and see you entering passwords on

379
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,800
your keyboard or your phone

380
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,639
and

381
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,480
there's a few protections that you can

382
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,760
get from them

383
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,959
firstly

384
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,480
you should just in general avoid

385
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,800
entering passwords and pins in public

386
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,440
and instead rely on biometrics like face

387
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
id and touch id

388
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,560
they might be able to figure out which

389
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,399
finger they need to cut off

390
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,040
but that's a very different threat to

391
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,959
somebody entering your password without

392
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,480
your knowledge

393
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,160
you're not only looking out for people

394
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,519
if there's a camera over your shoulder

395
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,399
that's the same issue

396
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,720
you can also get a modicum of privacy by

397
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,880
using a privacy shield like the one on

398
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,120
the picture

399
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,959
and if somebody's sitting next to you

400
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,399
they're unlikely to see what's on your

401
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,839
phone because it's

402
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,839
it just looks really dark

403
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,680
but it is directional so if you're using

404
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,199
your phone in landscape mode instead of

405
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,519
portrait it does approximately nothing

406
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,880
so the same goes if somebody's looking

407
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,320
down from above or up from below

408
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,399
keyloggers these can be software based

409
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,839
or hardware based

410
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,440
the main difference is that hardware is

411
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,800
something you can hit with a hammer

412
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,160
software is something you can only cuss

413
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,040
at

414
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,079
so

415
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,600
a software-based

416
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,880
keylogger can be dealt with in

417
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,839
primarily by using something like

418
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,639
tails which is an operating system

419
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,720
that runs in memory

420
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,880
so you're not actually using whatever

421
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,720
operating system you normally use where

422
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,639
the malware is installed but you're

423
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,720
using an entirely different one

424
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,079
and we'll talk a little bit about tails

425
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:22,959
later

426
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,720
you can also often just run an antivirus

427
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,320
scan because most key loggers are just

428
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
commodity malware

429
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,920
a hardware base might look like the one

430
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,839
in the picture but on a laptop it could

431
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,000
be hidden within the laptop so you might

432
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,920
not be able to see it

433
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
you might get some defense from using an

434
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,000
on-screen keyboard but then you've got

435
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,839
problems with

436
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,759
some malware that could

437
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,440
record your screen

438
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,839
so ideally it would be better just to

439
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,040
use a trusted device either that

440
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
of one belonging to a trusted friend or

441
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,959
maybe a library

442
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:55,839
so

443
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,360
keylogger is generally used to steal

444
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,880
your password so let's talk about

445
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,360
passwords

446
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,000
passwords should be long nonsensical

447
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
strings that are generated entirely

448
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,560
randomly and stored in an encrypted file

449
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,800
or database

450
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,079
then the file or database should be

451
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,880
unlocked with a single strong passphrase

452
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
and

453
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,160
yeah what we're obviously talking about

454
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,639
is password managers

455
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,720
there are two main varieties uh online

456
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,160
password managers and offline password

457
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,199
managers

458
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,600
the online variety will sync your

459
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,320
passwords onto your different devices

460
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,160
but it means that you're entrusting

461
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,600
whatever service it is with all of your

462
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,720
passwords

463
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,639
hopefully they can't read them

464
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,480
the offline variety gives you total

465
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,800
control over your passwords but with

466
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,040
that control comes responsibility to

467
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,399
synchronize them

468
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,920
across your different devices yourself

469
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,240
many passwords or many browsers have a

470
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,160
password manager built in now if you

471
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,079
choose to use that one and my main

472
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,759
recommendation would just be to make

473
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,759
sure to use a master password so that

474
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,120
they're encrypted and a wee bit harder

475
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,519
to steal

476
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,400
also make sure your passwords are unique

477
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,079
for each website

478
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,079
because a really common attack now is

479
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,400
credential stuffing where most people

480
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,959
don't use unique passwords for websites

481
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,959
and as a result if they get your

482
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,039
username and password they can try it on

483
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,280
every single site that they want to gain

484
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,760
access to and have a fair success rate

485
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,280
of gaining access

486
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,799
you can even go as far as using a

487
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,720
separate email account and maybe using

488
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,919
aliases

489
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,760
but that's a way that advanced and as

490
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,919
long as you're using a strong password

491
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,720
and you're not at really high risk

492
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,520
maybe not necessary

493
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,240
final tip is to

494
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,799
change your password after a breakup

495
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,240
your email password is particularly

496
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,760
important because it can be used to

497
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,960
reset

498
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,760
all of your accounts

499
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,039
on gmail you can also do a security and

500
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,880
a privacy checkup and you can actually

501
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,559
see what devices are logged into your

502
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,080
account and you can kick out stuff that

503
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,039
you don't want access anymore

504
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,799
and there's also a website called have i

505
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,039
been pwned and you can actually check

506
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,640
whether your credentials

507
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,919
have already been compromised

508
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,000
so password managers are great but have

509
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
you tried two-factor authentication

510
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,160
there are three varieties of this

511
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,679
text message

512
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,560
is the most popular and weakest

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,280
if your choice is text message or

515
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,480
nothing use text message but there are

516
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,919
two vulnerabilities that you really need

517
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,360
to know about

518
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,799
for highly

519
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,440
at-risk and targeted individuals there

520
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,679
is an ss7 vulnerability

521
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,520
and basically text messages are just

522
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,799
super insecure

523
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,240
they are transmitted entirely

524
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,559
unencrypted and a powerful adversary can

525
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,919
just pluck these out from the cell

526
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,880
network

527
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,640
and they've got your code

528
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,200
you wouldn't even know what's happened

529
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,120
there is a lower attack but maybe even

530
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,520
scarier attack which is sim swapping

531
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,840
where either by colluding with an

532
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,760
insider at a cell company or

533
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,080
by social engineering the company

534
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,480
they can actually have your phone number

535
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,240
switch to a sim card that they control

536
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,480
and a phone that they control and have

537
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,440
uh

538
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
just take control of your number and

539
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,600
then your two factor codes will be sent

540
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,679
to their phone

541
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,039
you will at least know that this has

542
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,960
happened but unfortunately it's because

543
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,039
your phone will stop working so

544
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,440
not great

545
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,360
so a stronger form is time-based

546
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,200
one-time password where there is no

547
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,960
interaction with anything else it is

548
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,440
stored either on an app on your phone

549
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,799
or on some kind of hardware token

550
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,320
an example of the hardware token is the

551
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
rsa secure id which is actually used in

552
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,919
conjunction with a pin

553
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,520
and is really really popular at

554
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
financial institutions

555
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,760
but ultimately no more secure than an

556
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,039
app on the phone because it's all

557
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,720
vulnerable to a man in the browser

558
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,840
attack

559
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,120
basically if you have malware on your

560
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,480
computer particularly something that's

561
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,480
in your browser you've got a problem

562
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,400
we've got u2f

563
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,280
is

564
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,400
another form of two-factor

565
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
authentication things like yuba keys it

566
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,200
uses some clever crypto and a usb device

567
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,360
which acts as a keyboard

568
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,159
and

569
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,520
provides a really strong form of

570
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,200
two-factor authentication

571
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,000
but

572
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,440
uh it's not very well supported uh over

573
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,039
the over the different websites so only

574
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,240
maybe half of your accounts will

575
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,039
actually support this

576
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,280
so security questions offer

577
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
approximately no protection from

578
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,280
somebody who knows you so instead of

579
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,600
filling in accurate information

580
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,640
use

581
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,720
long nonsensical strings

582
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,760
and store them in your password manager

583
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,200
now these should also be unique for

584
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,440
every account

585
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,080
the google advanced protection program

586
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,120
is also available for people who

587
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,520
are at particular risk highly targeted

588
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,919
individuals it provides a whole bunch of

589
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,360
extra protection

590
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,200
google will make it

591
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,799
way more difficult to hack into your

592
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,720
account and

593
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,320
provide enhanced protection from

594
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,799
phishing they'll provide some protection

595
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,880
from harmful downloads by forcing you to

596
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,480
get stuff from

597
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,520
the official app store or play store

598
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,840
and

599
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,720
there's a couple of drawbacks so

600
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
you have to use google's apps for your

601
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,240
mail and you have to use u2f two-factor

602
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,320
authentication so you need to either buy

603
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,230
their titan key or yubikey

604
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,480
[Music]

605
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,400
and it is a little bit more easy to lock

606
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,000
yourself out of your account but that is

607
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,880
also kind of the point

608
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,840
so how do we browse the internet

609
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,919
anonymously well let's start with some

610
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,400
myth busting it's not vpns

611
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,280
most vpns are terrible and they have two

612
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
primary use cases

613
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,760
one of them is evading geoblocking by

614
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,240
which i mean getting better netflix

615
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,400
and the other one is torrenting all the

616
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,320
things without getting all the emails

617
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,760
from the torrent trolls telling you that

618
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,480
you're going to jail

619
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,960
tor is the best we've got for actually

620
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,880
browsing the internet anonymously

621
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,720
tor works by proxying your connection

622
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,559
through three different computers or

623
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,880
nodes the first one knows who you are

624
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,720
but not where you're going the last one

625
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,480
knows where you're going but not who you

626
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,640
are and the middle one knows who the

627
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,679
first and last node are

628
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,280
there's a couple of vulnerabilities to

629
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,799
tor so

630
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,799
there's a problem with

631
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,880
centralization if all the nodes belong

632
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,120
to the same entity they know everything

633
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,960
if they collude with one another they

634
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,159
know everything

635
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,320
and there are some clever attacks that

636
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,480
use confirmation or correlation

637
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,880
so if they suspect that you are the one

638
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,400
visiting a particular website at a

639
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,320
certain time they can do some traffic

640
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,280
analysis and confirm that

641
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,320
uh private search engines like

642
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,120
duckduckgo are great you can keep your

643
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,400
search history out of the likes of

644
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,760
google

645
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,600
but they only provide any protection to

646
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,520
you while you're searching for stuff

647
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,360
and as soon as you actually go to a

648
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,400
website

649
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,960
you have no anonymity at all

650
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,159
you're also entrusting all of your

651
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,840
privacy to one entity who ultimately

652
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,480
knows who you are

653
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,159
there's a few ways that you can use tor

654
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,799
first of all the official sanctioned tor

655
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,360
browser which is based on firefox and

656
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,080
available for desktop and android

657
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,840
there is an ios version called onion

658
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,880
browser

659
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,039
but because ios mandates the use of

660
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,480
webkit

661
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,159
this may be a whole bunch leakier than

662
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,559
the official tour browser so it's not

663
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,799
it's not official

664
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,279
now brave is another unofficial version

665
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,360
and this is really really useful for

666
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,960
casual use

667
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,799
because again it may be leakier than the

668
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,400
official tor browser

669
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,000
but being chromium-based it makes your

670
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,600
experience on the internet a whole lot

671
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,918
better

672
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,880
it makes using tor super easy because

673
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
you can just click the button that says

674
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,039
open a new private browser window with

675
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,240
tor

676
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,440
and

677
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,679
even if you don't use brave with tor

678
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,120
there's a bunch of fingerprinting

679
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,520
protection and privacy protections that

680
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,559
are built in

681
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,000
that can

682
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,400
help to give you privacy even when

683
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,520
you're not

684
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,120
disassociating your ip address

685
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,480
tails is for the

686
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,799
more hardcore tour users

687
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,799
it's a linux based

688
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,320
live system that you've talked about

689
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,360
earlier

690
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,159
and it forces all of your internet

691
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,720
traffic to go through tor and it

692
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,039
mandates that with iptables rules or

693
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,559
firewall rules

694
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,679
to avoid

695
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,400
any kind of leaks of your ip address

696
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,279
if

697
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,080
for example you're opening a file

698
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,000
outside of your browser

699
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
that then interacts with the internet

700
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,440
that connection will still be made over

701
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,679
tour

702
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,559
tails will also

703
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,440
uh wipe all evidence of what you did

704
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,880
off your

705
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,000
uh

706
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,120
yeah during the session that you were

707
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,360
using tails it will

708
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,440
wipe all of the memory and there will be

709
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,200
approximately no evidence of anything

710
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,799
that you did on your computer while you

711
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,600
were using tails

712
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
so we talked about using tor as a client

713
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,000
but you can also use tor as a server to

714
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,400
anonymously publish

715
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,840
we're talking about hidden services or

716
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,600
onion addresses so in the same way a

717
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,760
client builds a

718
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,840
circuit through three nodes to the

719
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,559
internet a server can build the same

720
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,600
circuit

721
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,640
uh and then a tor compatible client can

722
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,559
connect to that server and it's done

723
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,080
entirely end to end encrypted

724
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,039
so wiggle is a service which

725
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,240
uses a procedure called wardriving

726
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,840
to map the location of

727
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,400
wi-fi access points

728
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,720
it will capture the ssid so this is a

729
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,200
kind of friendly name for your wi-fi

730
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,440
it will also capture the mac address or

731
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,039
bss id

732
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,080
and

733
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,640
you can also use date ranges to filter

734
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,279
the results

735
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,760
so again the example of having to

736
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,520
relocate to australia

737
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,400
if

738
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
somebody then war drives past your new

739
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,679
location and an adversary who knows

740
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,520
what ssid

741
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,200
what friendly name you like to call your

742
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,000
wi-fi and that's fairly unique if they

743
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,159
see that cropping up on the gold coast

744
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,159
then your location is going to be owned

745
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,080
it's also possible that if they know

746
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,799
which wi-fi access point you had

747
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,400
like to the point of actually knowing

748
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,360
what its mac address was they can then

749
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,720
filter for that mac address and see it

750
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,799
popping up in your new location

751
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,679
so

752
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,080
if your wi-fi access point may be

753
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,320
compromised in this way throw it away

754
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,080
and buy a new one at your new location

755
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,919
there's also an issue with phones being

756
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:04,840
used as

757
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,520
hotspots i'm not aware of any way that

758
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,840
you can spoof the mac address on this so

759
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,600
they could actually map

760
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,960
your movements if you use your phone as

761
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,039
a hotspot a lot for example at your

762
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,799
favorite cafe and pub

763
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,320
they might somebody might actually be

764
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,240
able to map out what locations you like

765
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,640
to visit

766
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,520
you can opt out of

767
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,240
being in wiggle but other services do

768
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
this too like google and microsoft so

769
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,640
you end up having to opt out of a lot of

770
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,039
different services and

771
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,480
this can just draw attention to yourself

772
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,240
because you end up with an ssid that's

773
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,159
like got various different ways of

774
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,880
saying opt out

775
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,279
so your clients can be tracked in a

776
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,120
similar way using war driving now the

777
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,279
software kismet can actually find

778
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,919
clients and even knows which access

779
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,679
point they're connected to

780
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,399
so windows and ios make it really easy

781
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,360
for you to spoof your mac address

782
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,120
android and mac os and linux do not make

783
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,320
this easy

784
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
you have to use third-party software or

785
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,480
terminal commands

786
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,240
but yeah where you can just

787
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
toggle this on i'd recommend everybody

788
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,480
does this

789
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,679
so for the truly paranoid

790
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,840
your wi-fi and bluetooth are basically

791
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
beaconing out all the time

792
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,279
and

793
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,440
shops airports

794
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,360
gyms and many other

795
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,159
areas will have beacons which track your

796
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,600
movements

797
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,039
they kind of want to know how you're

798
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,200
using their space if they're a shop they

799
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,240
even want to know how you're shopping

800
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,760
there's not much you can do about this

801
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,520
other than actually turning off those

802
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,000
radios

803
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,720
and in a world where we're all using

804
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,960
bluetooth headphones and fitness

805
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,240
trackers

806
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,760
it's not a practical solution for

807
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,720
everyone

808
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,520
but if your threat model

809
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,880
has this problem then you should

810
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,480
you should disable those radios

811
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,840
especially when you're not using them

812
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,240
full disk encryption can be used to

813
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,919
protect your data at rest

814
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,600
you'll want to do this because if

815
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,799
somebody gets access to your laptop

816
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,279
in various ways either they've stolen it

817
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,000
or they have

818
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,279
access to it

819
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,200
for a period of time and maybe you're

820
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,360
passing through airport security

821
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,120
you don't necessarily want them to be

822
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,760
able to just boot up your laptop and see

823
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,520
your stuff or remove your hard drive and

824
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,559
tamper with your device

825
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,440
so the built-in encryption in windows

826
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,600
bitlocker or mac os

827
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,640
file vault or linux lux is absolutely

828
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,880
good enough and

829
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,679
i'd recommend that you just turn that on

830
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:58,799
but

831
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,720
there's also some third-party software

832
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,320
called veracrypt

833
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,240
my main recommendation for this is that

834
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,320
if you have multiple different devices

835
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,520
and you want to encrypt usb drives then

836
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,200
veracrypt will allow you to decrypt

837
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,880
those usb drives on all of your devices

838
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,840
and protecting your communications can

839
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,039
be done

840
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,480
using

841
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,880
various methods the old way of doing

842
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,679
this is email encryption using pgp or

843
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,320
gpg this is still really useful today

844
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,480
for verification of software

845
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,480
and if you are somebody who makes

846
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,480
security disclosures to

847
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,159
websites of zero-day vulnerabilities

848
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,520
that you've discovered

849
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,039
you really do need to learn how this

850
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,279
works

851
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,000
but it's really hard and

852
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,080
you'll probably mess it up at some point

853
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,679
it makes searching your emails really

854
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:52,799
difficult

855
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,840
and

856
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,000
uh is just generally

857
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,880
uh yeah really hard so

858
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,880
for those of us who are not security

859
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,159
researchers uh dropping zero days to our

860
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,360
vendors

861
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,240
signal and whatsapp provide the same

862
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,159
strong encryption but make it really

863
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,600
easy to use

864
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,720
through

865
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,880
just a phone app

866
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,320
whatsapp is owned by facebook so even

867
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,760
though they can't look at the content of

868
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,240
your messages they can still

869
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,880
see who's talking to who how often they

870
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,640
talk when they talk

871
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,399
so they can still profile you pretty

872
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,159
effectively that way

873
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,919
another disadvantage is that you have to

874
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,919
share your mobile number and we talked

875
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,880
about sim swapping earlier and

876
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,039
we really don't want to share our phone

877
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,960
number with people we don't trust

878
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,440
it's great for friends and family but

879
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,880
for strangers that you're meeting for

880
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,240
the first time

881
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,600
social media

882
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,360
discord might be a much better

883
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,880
alternative

884
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,159
and

885
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,679
obviously there is a lot of personal

886
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,679
information on those sites too so it's a

887
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,679
personal choice which one you want to

888
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,399
share

889
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,000
but social media offers a really good

890
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,320
protection because you can really easily

891
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,600
block people

892
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,840
and

893
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,519
yeah you don't have to give your phone

894
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,600
number out and

895
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,080
you can

896
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,760
okay those are the good things bad

897
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,559
things

898
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,840
uh it's not end to end encrypted and

899
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,559
snapchat allegedly had their employee

900
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,080
employees

901
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,720
look at their users personal information

902
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,760
including phone numbers and also

903
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,519
look at the snaps or photos of their

904
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,240
users as well

905
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,039
there's a lot of different privacy

906
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,280
settings on your social medias

907
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,569
[Music]

908
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,720
you can control who has access to your

909
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,240
profile so you can make your profile

910
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,960
entirely private and accessible only to

911
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,080
your friends if that's something you

912
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,600
want to do

913
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,279
you can also control who's tagging you

914
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,399
in photos

915
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,480
you can block a piece of accounts

916
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,399
you can control who has access to dms

917
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,080
which is probably a good idea

918
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,159
and you can limit the amount of location

919
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,679
information that the social media gives

920
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,360
up because social media loves to share

921
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,559
your location but you might not

922
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,399
social media also loves to track you

923
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,159
outside of their social media site

924
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,519
you'll see they have their feelers all

925
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,200
over the place with their like buttons

926
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,480
and all that

927
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,279
so

928
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,120
you can to a certain extent limit that

929
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,279
with your social media settings

930
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,640
and you can just go ahead and request

931
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,919
what data they have on you and go

932
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,200
through it to see

933
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,399
iot is becoming really popular and

934
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,559
there's a lot of different types that

935
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,480
we're probably using ourselves

936
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,200
smart assistants are a good example

937
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,039
these

938
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,000
the main risks with these are that

939
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,600
they'll quite happily reveal your full

940
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,760
location so if you ask what's my

941
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,240
location to your echo device they will

942
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,679
they will tell you

943
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,679
including your flat number

944
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,080
so if you're on a video call or a voice

945
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,480
call with someone new you might want to

946
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,560
either mute your echo device or wear

947
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,000
headphones on the call so that they

948
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,199
can't just

949
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,158
ask for your location

950
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,760
they can also unlock your doors if you

951
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,079
use them in conjunction with smart locks

952
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,000
so if your flat isn't totally soundproof

953
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,239
like mine they could just yell from the

954
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,359
hallway and let themselves in

955
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,480
and

956
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,440
even if your house is quite soundproof

957
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,440
they could commandeer some other bit of

958
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,679
iot in your house that has a speaker and

959
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,918
then speak to your smart speaker to let

960
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,359
them in

961
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,480
so

962
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,440
yeah

963
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,320
a lot of risks if you have those

964
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,359
along with other devices

965
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,399
uh smart thermostats

966
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,159
sure nobody wants to come back to a cold

967
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,839
house or a hot house uh but if you

968
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,599
uh if you

969
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,760
have somebody leave your property that

970
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,280
no longer needs access to the smart

971
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,280
thermostat you probably want to get rid

972
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,040
of their access to that smart thermostat

973
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,720
pretty quickly because people have

974
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,720
abused access to smart thermostats to

975
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,800
make a residence in the house

976
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,079
uncomfortably

977
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,240
hot or cold

978
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,160
video doorbells are also really useful

979
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,320
as well as other security cameras

980
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,079
you can catch stalkers people who are

981
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,440
walking past your house just a little

982
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,320
bit too often or looking through windows

983
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,839
but again

984
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,359
when somebody leaves the household they

985
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,880
should lose their access to that video

986
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,800
doorbell very quickly

987
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,680
and if these things get hacked

988
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,520
you've got the problem that the hacker

989
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,200
will then be aware of your comings and

990
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
goings

991
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,720
and

992
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,800
also if you have a cloud-based service

993
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,880
that the the cloud

994
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,960
who's storing all of the video

995
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,320
will also be able to see your comings

996
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,800
and goings

997
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,359
a lot of us are wearing fitness trackers

998
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,960
they capture huge amounts of data which

999
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,160
is really useful for tracking your

1000
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,320
fitness but you really don't want other

1001
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,839
people to have access to that data

1002
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,160
because it's really revealing

1003
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,520
not going to talk anymore about fitness

1004
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,800
trackers because jason's going to talk

1005
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,560
on that later on so if you're interested

1006
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,280
you can catch that

1007
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,000
one big defense with iot is to segment

1008
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,599
your network better

1009
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,720
so you can use a tool like pfsense which

1010
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,079
is a router

1011
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,320
and vlans on a

1012
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,040
managed switch to

1013
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,520
have a separate network for your iot

1014
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,599
devices to the rest of your network

1015
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,839
apple air tags

1016
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,560
are a small inexpensive

1017
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,400
easily concealed and highly accurate

1018
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,160
tracking devices

1019
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,760
they use the

1020
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,240
find my network uh same as your iphone

1021
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,720
their use cases are supposed to be

1022
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,880
finding your keys or keeping track of

1023
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,200
your luggage but unfortunately they've

1024
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,760
also been used to steal cars and stalk

1025
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,079
people

1026
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,560
so apple's worked quite hard to on

1027
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,240
mitigations for this

1028
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,079
uh they have

1029
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,400
built-in uh speaker

1030
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,880
which will sound after

1031
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,560
it was originally three days which is a

1032
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,720
very long time i believe now it's

1033
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,880
between eight and twelve hours if it's

1034
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,480
not been in contact with the device that

1035
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,720
it's registered with this alarm should

1036
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,320
sound but

1037
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,480
devices have been modified to remove

1038
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,040
that speaker

1039
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,839
so some alternatives to tracking these

1040
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,480
things is that if you have an iphone

1041
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,480
you will actually get a notification

1042
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,880
that uh airtag has been found moving

1043
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,760
with you if you use android you need a

1044
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,720
third-party app uh called tracker detect

1045
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,800
and if you don't have a smartphone your

1046
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,480
sol

1047
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,760
airpods

1048
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,440
have basically the same problem they're

1049
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,359
small and you can track them using find

1050
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,598
buy

1051
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,240
mobile malware

1052
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,119
this can be commodity malware like

1053
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,760
stalkerware this is malware that has

1054
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,240
access to your camera your microphone

1055
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,119
and gps location

1056
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,720
the commodity variety is not

1057
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,480
particularly subtle

1058
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,320
government malware does basically the

1059
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,200
same things but much more subtly you

1060
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,040
might not even know it's been installed

1061
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,040
it might use a zero-click vulnerability

1062
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,320
to get itself onto your phone

1063
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,359
malicious mobile device management is a

1064
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,599
different type of mobile malware

1065
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,520
and this is primarily installed using

1066
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,040
social engineering

1067
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,800
mobile device management is a legitimate

1068
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,560
thing used by businesses and schools to

1069
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,320
manage their devices

1070
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,480
but if you have a personal device you

1071
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,760
really really don't want to give

1072
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
somebody the ability to manage it for

1073
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,839
you

1074
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,440
so a few tips you can avoid third-party

1075
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,200
app stores because they're loaded with

1076
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,400
malware

1077
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,160
you can delete unknown apps on your

1078
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,119
phone

1079
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,200
and if you have an app on your phone

1080
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,040
which you really don't want to delete

1081
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,760
but

1082
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,920
it's kind of got excessive permissions

1083
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,760
so whether that's a calculator that's

1084
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,800
got your location camera and mic

1085
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,520
you can just you know get rid of

1086
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,000
all of those permissions

1087
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,560
and finally just generally good advice

1088
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,078
keep your os and apps up to date

1089
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,160
if you are a highly targeted individual

1090
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,640
like a journalist blowing the whistle on

1091
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,440
bad things or reporting on bad

1092
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,560
governments

1093
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,960
you might find yourself the victim of

1094
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,800
this government level malware

1095
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,760
and citizen lab can help you out

1096
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,000
they track human rights threats and

1097
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,680
they'll analyze the malware that's been

1098
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,880
sent to journalists who have been

1099
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,079
targeted

1100
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,599
and help them to recover from the

1101
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,760
situation

1102
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,359
these guys are absolutely not for

1103
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,839
commodity malware so you know don't

1104
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,160
bother these guys unless you really need

1105
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,319
it

1106
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,480
so i've got a bit of further information

1107
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,079
i'll be making these slides available

1108
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,440
after the talk

1109
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,480
um but we'll run through these quickly

1110
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,960
follow eva on twitter she's got loads of

1111
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,640
good stuff

1112
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,200
if you are

1113
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,160
somebody who programs things who makes

1114
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,359
things

1115
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,280
look through ibm's

1116
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,440
principles to combat domestic abuse so

1117
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,040
that you can avoid some of the security

1118
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,800
fails or security engineering fails that

1119
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,920
we've discussed in this talk

1120
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,079
there's a manual for

1121
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,560
locking your iphone down where personal

1122
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,160
safety is an issue

1123
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,440
and

1124
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,200
i've also added apple's update uh on

1125
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,880
their air tags that's a press release of

1126
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,720
the things that they did to the air tags

1127
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,359
to make them less creepy

1128
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,560
if you're interested in surveillance

1129
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,880
self-defense eff has a whole site on

1130
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,839
this

1131
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:56,960
and

1132
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,440
uh google also has a safety page which

1133
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,880
is there for you to do your security

1134
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,200
checks

1135
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,400
uh if you're interested in

1136
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,480
whistleblowing i've got

1137
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,000
some really interesting new research

1138
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,520
from cambridge

1139
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,520
and naomi wu's security camera advice

1140
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,040
and boom

1141
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,920
so

1142
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,000
make sure you educate your friends and

1143
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,640
family on security and privacy

1144
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,240
because if you become too difficult to

1145
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,319
target they may be targeted in order to

1146
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,839
get to you

1147
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,440
and my mom's mastered pretty much

1148
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,520
everything in this talk so you really

1149
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,720
can't teach this to anyone

1150
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,200
and uh yeah thanks very much for

1151
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,480
listening and stay safe out there
