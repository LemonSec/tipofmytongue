1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,640
thank you

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,679
um so thank you for coming along and

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,000
listening to my talk uh this is a topic

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,559
i'm in fact i'm passionate about it's

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,400
also great to be given a talking

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,560
personally first time

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,199
in two years um hopefully we'll see more

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,720
of this thing happening

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,640
um later in the year as well more

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,279
impressive about it's great um so i'm

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,199
going to be working about giving a whole

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,519
slide of about myself i'll just give you

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,160
a quick thing um so my name is

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,520
i

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,840
involved in application security so this

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,000
is why i have such a vested interest in

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,480
supply chains or more supply chains from

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,959
the software

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,079
so

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,480
i'm going to start off with

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,960
two questions and don't answer them now

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,879
i'll come to them at the end but

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,000
now the first question is would you

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,479
allow any sort of stranger off the

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,360
street

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,880
to commit code

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,119
to your code

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,880
i think another answer for this but

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,880
let's keep that in mind

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,640
and then the second one if you're an

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,160
attacker would you take the easy route

32
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,840
[Music]

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
so i think one of the important things

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,759
is we need to take a step back and see

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,400
how things have changed

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,880
especially when it comes to developing

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,920
software and including uh third party

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,000
software

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,479
so when i first got off my career i

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,399
started off

41
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,000
at a time where

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,240
third party software wasn't really that

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,200
common

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,920
most often or you would develop things

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,079
from the ground up so companies will go

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,040
off pull down internal libraries and

47
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,119
you'd probably be asked the question why

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,479
would you want to use someone else's

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,520
stuff why not develop an attorney from

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,479
the security point of view this is great

51
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,639
you have better conform visibility into

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,840
the alliance

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,200
from a code re-usability point of view

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,360
it's not so great i mean you could

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,200
reinvent the wheel there's a lot of

56
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,520
maintenance around these packages so

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,680
everything sort of new functionality or

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,840
updates that needs to be done you have

59
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
to have invested time and

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959
resources doing that

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,280
so if you shift towards to what how we

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,120
approach it today it's completely

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,239
changed

64
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,720
so i think of most applications it's

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,640
kind of blue you take all these

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,560
different libraries and frameworks and

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,400
you code them together to form the

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,560
functions and features that you want and

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,319
this is fantastic from a business point

70
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,640
of view what it means is we can get

71
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,480
things out faster and quite going with

72
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,680
nasa efforts

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,360
from a security point of view though it

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,480
does introduce some element of rights

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,760
you're taking

76
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,159
code essentially from outside your

77
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,519
organization clearly to your

78
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,200
suffering

79
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,800
and this is where the risk starts

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,519
growing and it's starting to become

81
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,440
more of an issue today and i'll go

82
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,599
through that

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,879
what i have here is a snapshot from a

84
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,400
company called

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,840
so i'm going to talk about kind of the

86
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,200
de facto

87
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,120
uh name in uh dependencies and third

88
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
party libraries

89
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,879
and every year they

90
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,319
produce those reports called uh i've got

91
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,239
to remember the name of it

92
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,560
the state of the software supply chain

93
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,040
so they do that on a daily basis

94
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,080
and what this shows is just the number

95
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,560
of downloads in terms of an increase so

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,239
this was from ross's report 2021

97
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,680
um

98
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,360
comparing that to the year before so

99
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,840
2020. i'm really interested to see what

100
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,680
this year's report's going to like that

101
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,200
but you can see those numbers there are

102
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,360
quite significant and that is the

103
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,480
increase

104
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,000
in the number of downloads of the

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,840
different languages

106
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,000
so you're looking towards something like

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,879
java which is like 71

108
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,840
um join the script fifty percent

109
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,478
bathroom ninety-two percent so on and so

110
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,238
forth and those are already a high

111
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,079
number and they just keep on growing

112
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,160
correctly and this kind of forms into

113
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,759
that whole point about the way we change

114
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,639
our

115
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,759
strategy

116
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,440
that's great we need to get those things

117
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,320
out a lot quicker

118
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,360
so

119
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,600
this

120
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
does introduce the element of press as i

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,960
mentioned

122
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,360
um

123
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
[Music]

124
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,560
because you have the third party

125
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,199
occurred this means attackers can start

126
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,400
leveraging this to attack organizations

127
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,960
or kind

128
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,649
[Music]

129
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,880
could use but some of the methods that

130
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,320
they can use to

131
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,120
target these libraries and targeted

132
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,720
organizations

133
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,400
so at the top is

134
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,520
a

135
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,160
attack type called dependency confusion

136
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,400
this is quite a relatively new stacked

137
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
up it was

138
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,960
a ton of conceptualized last year

139
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,160
this leverages the way package managers

140
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,520
work

141
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,039
um

142
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,000
with package managers you typically have

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,800
a

144
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,840
public

145
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,960
facing repository so in the likes of

146
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
java modern

147
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,720
you could have made a repository called

148
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,160
native central

149
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,479
um in parthenon you have pie pie

150
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,120
and

151
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,960
organizations have their own internal

152
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,880
primary repositories and these are

153
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,280
repositories that aren't

154
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,680
um publicly facing well they shouldn't

155
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,080
be there any progress that are only

156
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,240
accessible to their organization and

157
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,120
this is where organizations would place

158
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,080
their own

159
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,520
packages

160
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
on needed repositories so any sort of

161
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,840
software they're

162
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,160
developing including

163
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,080
web applications that are bundled up

164
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,840
nicely and can

165
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,520
be done about a

166
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,039
crc

167
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,199
way of doing things

168
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,680
now dependency confusion

169
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,919
takes these two repositories and it

170
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,639
leverages the fact that by default

171
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,479
most package managers will attempt to

172
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,160
download the package from the public

173
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,960
repository first before it attacks any

174
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,120
completed problem

175
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,199
so what attacker could do is create the

176
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,319
same package structure name and version

177
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,400
number and

178
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,160
then they can post it as a public

179
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,759
repository

180
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,599
so when the organization comes to

181
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,400
develop and then pick the right version

182
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,880
or download the attacker's package

183
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,960
versus the external one

184
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,039
and this

185
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,720
attack type is actually very quite

186
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,080
significantly i forgot the exact numbers

187
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,120
it is about silence of course but it is

188
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,599
becoming a big issue in fact it's now

189
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,759
one of the most common types of attacks

190
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,440
on software dependencies

191
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,280
other examples

192
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,000
of tyre attacks are malicious packages

193
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,400
so this is where an attacker would

194
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,560
actually purposely create a package with

195
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,599
vulnerability with that

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,599
and then compromise packages so this is

197
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,000
quite similar to the malicious packages

198
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,240
but this is where so the german package

199
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
that the attacker compromises

200
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,000
that account somehow so they can

201
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,759
compromise the author's account or

202
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,080
compromise the bullet structure that

203
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,960
builds and deploys that package

204
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,800
and then the last one is vulnerable

205
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,440
packages so these again are legitimate

206
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,120
packages but they have some sort of

207
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,280
vulnerability in it whereby they're

208
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,638
tackled within your own exploit

209
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,360
and coming towards

210
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,160
the title of this talk is

211
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,240
it's becoming very impressive so i've

212
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,520
personally seen this starting to rank up

213
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,680
um i've started giving this book

214
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,080
a lot of designs back in 2019

215
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,080
but um

216
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
i started giving this book in 2019 i

217
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,159
couldn't wrap my head around the fact

218
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,719
that there's a glaring whole

219
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,679
easy goal for attackers and i couldn't

220
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,159
figure out what other entire regime is

221
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,000
first forward to today

222
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,760
we're starting to see that happening

223
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,720
pretty significantly i just saw a tweet

224
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,040
yesterday from trusted said oh

225
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,920
[Music]

226
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,880
actually sorry 2020 um all the way

227
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,240
through to

228
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,640
uh 2022.

229
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
um so you started off with the likes of

230
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,519
solarwinds which i'm sure many of you

231
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,320
realize or heard about the internet so

232
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,120
that happened in december 2022

233
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
um and then the latest one actually

234
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,959
happened this week and i'll actually

235
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,560
show hopefully a lot of them

236
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,920
so one of the things i'm not doing when

237
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,680
everybody

238
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,399
is to give some real world examples so

239
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,880
it's always good saying hey this may be

240
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,360
an issue or this could probably happen

241
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,120
or whatever

242
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,680
this is this could happen this has

243
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,800
happened um and trying to highlight some

244
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,720
cases where it has happened

245
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,680
so probably one of the most

246
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,839
targeted philosophies

247
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,760
at the moment is npm

248
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,279
so low package manager or whiteboard

249
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,600
um so this is basically

250
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,920
javascript

251
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,800
and

252
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,279
there have been numerous cases over the

253
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,440
last two weeks and months where

254
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,120
attackers have

255
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,360
leveraged the

256
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
public nature of it and started hosting

257
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,680
their own malicious packages so they've

258
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,480
done things from parker's quantity uh

259
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,360
squadron is where attack would try and

260
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
create a package with a very similar

261
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
name or

262
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,440
notion to the package to target

263
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,880
so example

264
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,160
was

265
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,640
this one with roboblocks there was some

266
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,480
npm

267
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,560
packages that you could buy in the

268
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,880
discord

269
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,020
[Music]

270
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,200
which package is a legitimate package

271
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,040
that's probably one of the problems that

272
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,120
we face today there's no way of saying

273
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,200
well this is a legitimate this is

274
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,560
probably nice

275
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,079
um

276
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,000
and then i think

277
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,640
i forgot the exact article but also

278
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,880
recently um

279
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,640
spring before

280
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,160
they were

281
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
doing research and they found a whole

282
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,959
bunch of other malicious packages on him

283
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,600
here i write it i actually didn't know

284
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,720
this for recently

285
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,880
and now i'm doing a pretty good job of

286
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,120
finding rid of this but it's

287
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
basically an easy battle because i'm

288
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,600
also in nature most

289
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,959
attackers can just simply go

290
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,549
[Music]

291
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,120
when people are using packages for

292
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,320
software the iphone comes in their own

293
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,800
conclusion that okay it's an official

294
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
repository so therefore everything can

295
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,199
be trusted

296
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,680
and thank you very much most packages

297
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,279
are legitimate and unfortunately there

298
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,800
are some that aren't

299
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,519
and this example we have thankfully

300
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,399
wasn't an idiologist mental malicious

301
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,800
package but there was a package that

302
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,680
apps did absolutely nothing nonetheless

303
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,600
they have three fathers

304
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
if you try to use this package it would

305
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,639
accomplish nothing

306
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,320
um

307
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,240
and i don't know why

308
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,639
the author created this package maybe

309
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,760
they were gonna

310
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,040
do something with the letter

311
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
there was only one version um and it

312
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,120
eventually got taken over by the

313
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
official npm

314
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,240
accounts

315
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,839
this package name was

316
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,120
dash that was named just dash

317
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,560
again i think they're assuming that

318
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,839
people will start things when they're

319
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,000
dropping commands

320
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
what was worrying and so great about

321
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,839
this is if you have a look at those

322
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,839
graphs

323
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,279
the first point in the graph is when

324
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,480
that packet was released or sorry when i

325
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,160
could do snapshots so with the npm

326
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,920
repository

327
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,040
downloads and how many dependents so how

328
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,040
many other packages used as a dependency

329
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,320
and that first snapshot was taken in

330
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,720
19th of august in 2021

331
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,240
sorry that's a tough one

332
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,000
and

333
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,560
all the way through to just a few weeks

334
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,680
ago

335
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,240
and you can see the significant increase

336
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,399
so we talked about thousands of weekly

337
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,680
downloads

338
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,000
and there was about

339
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,040
94 i think

340
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,560
dependence uh

341
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,360
84 other packages depending on how has

342
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,839
package of the dependency

343
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,959
and this package does nothing

344
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,199
so that to me points especially if

345
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,800
people are just downloading stuff

346
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,760
without actually that

347
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,040
another example thankfully this one

348
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,360
didn't go anywhere but it could have

349
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,959
ended up really bad

350
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,399
php

351
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,800
i'm sure we all are all parallel page

352
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
peers you have really common things such

353
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,839
as wordpress

354
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,880
um php

355
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,160
and what the attack has done is it

356
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,519
managed to

357
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,760
do a malicious code commit to the

358
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,720
official php repository

359
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
if that got out you can imagine the

360
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,959
impact that that would have but

361
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,440
thankfully that coach comment was called

362
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,600
everybody else anyway and php

363
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,519
subsequently changed their whole way

364
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,160
that they not even

365
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,079
i think they moved for possibilities to

366
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,519
get started

367
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,320
but that just shows you the potential

368
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,440
for this

369
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,199
if they if the attacker managed to

370
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,360
successfully put a backboard

371
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,680
that would have compromised thousands if

372
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,600
not tens of thousands

373
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,720
of

374
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,360
service potential

375
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:06,748
[Music]

376
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,360
uh

377
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,639
this one

378
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,240
i have mixed reactions about this

379
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,360
because

380
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,279
on the one hand it is pretty significant

381
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,399
so java is very widely used blog for jay

382
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,440
is

383
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,079
the kind of de facto logging framework

384
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,000
so it is used extensively across

385
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,320
multiple applications in java so you're

386
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,360
talking about web apps

387
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,440
and so the breadth of this was pretty

388
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,199
significant the fact that you could also

389
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,600
export exported with redness and ease um

390
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,519
when i said i read into these it very

391
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,320
much depended so if it was like

392
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,639
an internally developed web application

393
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,279
it would be pretty difficult because

394
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,600
everything you're doing

395
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,440
whereas if you have open source you can

396
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,199
actually then see things

397
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,839
see the code and all that lesson is

398
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,399
pretty significant and then allow

399
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:07,399
foreign execution

400
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,480
the worrying thing about this is the

401
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,839
aftermath

402
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,079
so a lot of these types of great perhaps

403
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,560
there but then you stand back and look

404
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,399
at it a few

405
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,720
weeks months later

406
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,610
how many

407
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:33,700
[Music]

408
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,800
all right so let's first write out some

409
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
numbers

410
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,439
one million

411
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,720
how many do you think

412
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,759
that's about money

413
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,399
one question four million

414
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,500
[Music]

415
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,120
um since the december the

416
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,000
10th when it came out

417
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,479
[Music]

418
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,559
what

419
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,520
so

420
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,400
since december the 10th there's been 30

421
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,679
just over

422
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,640
say around about probably now close to

423
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,840
37 and a half million dollars

424
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,200
of a vulnerable version of oxygen

425
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,919
and that accounts for 46

426
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,520
of all downloads

427
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,320
are blocked from jail

428
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,760
and the thing at the time that really

429
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,679
got me warmed up is the way we're

430
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,000
approaching this and i'll come

431
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,720
a bit later

432
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,280
ironically another gentleman will be

433
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,000
patchy strands

434
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,679
and this one here is pretty significant

435
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,280
um

436
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,120
the reason why i picked this when i was

437
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,280
debating when i should stole

438
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,679
paul conventions

439
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,320
this happened in 2017

440
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,200
organization for imperfects which i'm

441
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,600
sure most of us have heard about

442
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,160
and it's been subsequent i mean

443
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
sometimes sense

444
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,720
that vulnerability costs that company

445
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,840
one and a half billion dollars

446
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,080
but more importantly for me is that

447
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,000
vulnerability should have made people

448
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,120
aware

449
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
of the things that you need to do back

450
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,960
in 2017

451
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,840
so the really frustrating thing for me

452
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,080
um when i love today is

453
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,799
without projecting that

454
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,400
people should have already been prepared

455
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,480
based off this vulnerability

456
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,919
we have people going around not

457
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,240
wondering whether we're using them for j

458
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,080
but this vulnerability here where patchy

459
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,000
stretch should have got people thinking

460
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,559
about this

461
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,960
and then actually we find a separate

462
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,160
situation

463
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,350
oh my gosh another day

464
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,520
[Music]

465
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:03,860
um

466
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,200
[Music]

467
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
and hopefully with this i'll be able to

468
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,679
show you a uh demo and talk us through

469
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,240
this but again another vulnerability has

470
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,760
come out

471
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,919
not aware of any attacks yet but there

472
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,600
is a working proof of concept

473
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,640
so

474
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,200
we have these problems

475
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,480
so

476
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,080
this was one of the very frustrating

477
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,880
things

478
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
with relaxing work for jay when it came

479
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,799
out

480
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,160
when it came out

481
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,919
we saw many people jumping on it and

482
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,679
that was great

483
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,720
but in my view were oppression and wrong

484
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,640
so about that i mean

485
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,720
people trying to create satellite

486
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,960
scanners but hey we're going to scan

487
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,880
your network and scan all the files on

488
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,679
that's great for software that you buy

489
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,760
or use open source

490
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,160
fantastic but any kind of software that

491
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,760
you develop

492
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,840
that's not sustainable

493
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
and it's a really rudimentary way of

494
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,280
doing it there are ways that are going

495
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,960
to be much better

496
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,840
and as i said back in 2017

497
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,360
that should have been a long while for

498
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,679
you to start doing this stuff

499
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,440
which is why i would work for jake and

500
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,360
i'm so frustrated

501
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,159
but as you see it's still a problem we

502
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,720
still try and solve the same problem

503
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,000
using old methods

504
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,000
so the way we should be doing these

505
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,120
things is using something called sca the

506
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,679
software composition analysis well what

507
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,000
this does is actually scan the code

508
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,320
generates what's termed a software

509
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,000
development materials and s1

510
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,080
that that can be used to manage your

511
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,720
dependencies in your software the sas

512
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,600
model can also be scanned by the sca

513
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,520
to determine which packages are

514
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,360
vulnerable

515
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,840
so in the case of a multiple job if you

516
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,440
use appropriate

517
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
sda you can send

518
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,640
in hey

519
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,799
where am i using this specific version

520
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,400
of this package

521
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,200
all these uh projects create anonymous

522
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,280
exactly where i need to go and update

523
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,120
those libraries i can't update those

524
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,039
libraries i don't know where i can

525
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,000
running

526
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,039
focus uh remediation so rats that kind

527
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,000
of thing

528
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,080
you're not dealing with this by me

529
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,760
and this is what organizations shouldn't

530
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,240
be doing back in 20 from 2017 likewise

531
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,559
not very network scanners and thought

532
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,840
scanners and that kind of thing

533
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,600
this is gold

534
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,799
this is

535
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,120
how you can help solve this problem

536
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,760
so what are the tools that does a really

537
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,080
fantastic job i don't often recommend

538
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,880
tools i try to keep as much as possible

539
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,440
but i like exception for the school

540
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
this is something i've seen firsthand

541
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,280
the benefit of

542
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,039
it's a total loss that can

543
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,550
[Music]

544
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,200
[Music]

545
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,440
or thousands of dollars to use but it's

546
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,799
free

547
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,280
use it there's like no reason why

548
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,039
you should be using something like this

549
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,200
and make sure that you integrate this in

550
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,679
your body cycle so it's continuously

551
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,799
doing

552
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,120
this scanning before it's

553
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,880
continuously creating the results

554
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,720
it's not a single point of time once the

555
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,799
vulnerability comes up you need to make

556
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,799
sure you stay on top of this this is

557
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,799
something i've seen

558
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,000
done

559
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,159
generally pretty

560
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,600
quietly in the past where

561
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,240
versions will be used at that specific

562
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
point in time and then they won't be

563
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,880
updated afterwards it's a continuous

564
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,960
process you need to make sure that you

565
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,880
stay on top of this

566
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,480
so what i'm going to do now

567
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,280
is

568
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,240
i'm going to show some examples

569
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,249
[Music]

570
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,250
[Music]

571
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,319
[Music]

572
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,320
uh

573
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:35,459
[Music]

574
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,240
there we go

575
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,080
so i have some projects in here you can

576
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,039
see it's gonna

577
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,520
boards and all that kind of stuff

578
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,879
but the really cool stuff about this is

579
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,840
and now you start seeing the snapshots

580
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,320
away your different vulnerabilities

581
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,559
so if i can i can see the first series

582
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,000
so you can now start seeing where

583
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,520
what makes up this specific building

584
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,159
on specific projects and you can even

585
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,480
see when packages are out of date

586
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,720
but you're probably more interested in

587
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,490
the vulnerabilities

588
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,630
[Music]

589
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,480
and you can go with the vulnerabilities

590
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,799
now you can start seeing snapshots

591
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,320
of the different vulnerabilities and

592
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,520
severity

593
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,559
so now this makes triaging the update

594
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,320
5000 updates

595
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,640
even better so you can start determining

596
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,840
from the top

597
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,320
critical high

598
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,039
maybe in england

599
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,480
the other also very important thing is

600
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,440
you can

601
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,200
with this tool

602
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,520
come into the components view

603
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,120
and then start searching for different

604
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,080
components across all your projects

605
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,960
so

606
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
say for

607
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,559
there's very instance

608
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,200
entry for this like there was with a

609
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,320
spring

610
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,640
which is why you see

611
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,159
that spring demo

612
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,279
this week

613
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,360
it should be showing vulnerabilities

614
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,240
because that is actually wrong

615
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,400
but because there's no entry yet in the

616
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,360
vulnerability databases saying

617
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,919
um some other ones that can be applied

618
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:50,880
as well

619
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,320
um

620
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,240
you can't see that or fan when you

621
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,919
notice above eventually you can come

622
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,960
into this component section search for

623
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,360
the companions and see where to be used

624
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,959
and then deal with it appropriately

625
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,080
and as i mentioned

626
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,480
one of the other

627
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,279
best of this was

628
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,480
the continuous advice

629
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,320
so this toy has a planner that allows

630
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,880
you to integrate with jenkins and you

631
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,679
can actually start running this as part

632
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,520
of your whole cycle

633
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,320
so as you can see on the right hand side

634
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,919
there's a nice graph so you can actually

635
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,840
see that little fact

636
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,279
that projects

637
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,440
and see how many probabilities you have

638
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,360
and all of that and you can't even go

639
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,840
further

640
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,440
so what you can actually do

641
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,360
[Music]

642
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,440
at the bottom is you can have these kind

643
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,520
of release gates

644
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,559
uh

645
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,679
what they're called their thresholds

646
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,520
so you can actually cause the bubble to

647
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,159
fail if it has a certain level of

648
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,000
critical vulnerabilities

649
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,919
or a certain number of high

650
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,080
you can set those thresholds and whether

651
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,320
they're new or existing

652
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,000
so you can have suddenly

653
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,480
start being reactive rather than

654
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,159
um also

655
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,520
being proud rather than being reactive

656
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,679
so you can start really attacking this i

657
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,520
do have a continuous manner

658
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,000
so those are the tools that you can use

659
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,679
now as i mentioned

660
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,760
maybe a bit more exciting is the spring

661
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,120
of mobility

662
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,679
so the spring capability came out this

663
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,840
week two days ago in fact

664
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,399
on wednesday

665
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,840
and there is

666
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,360
this game

667
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:19,300
[Music]

668
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,320
cool so i'm saying

669
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:55,890
[Music]

670
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,840
simple page

671
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,559
this is a beautiful concept so

672
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,200
bear with me

673
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,919
the real assignment is probably lower

674
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:08,799
level

675
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,080
and then the actual exponents itself

676
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:21,679
so

677
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,760
what we have here is

678
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,200
some query that's used around this

679
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,320
concept

680
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,679
um

681
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,919
this is the vulnerability in the spring

682
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,399
mvc model view container

683
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,679
it's a

684
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,600
passion that's used by many web

685
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,559
applications in order to represent

686
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,360
business like logic data and then

687
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,279
represent that as a view to the user

688
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,000
the

689
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,559
the interesting bit for the proof of

690
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,600
concept is

691
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,600
the view could really be anything the

692
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,279
the vulnerability itself plasma

693
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,919
controller where you have a vine this is

694
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,880
basically a way of tying the model

695
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,840
to your business content

696
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,360
and

697
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,279
we

698
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,240
allocating this controller as a resource

699
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,559
called part and

700
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,360
this is where the magic happens

701
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,679
this next book

702
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,760
so listen

703
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,840
when the song moves came out a little

704
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,000
bit of confusion around it

705
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,399
goes back to get it working

706
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,600
um there were some difficulties between

707
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,320
the

708
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,919
x-ray script itself

709
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,720
some details and it's but eventually we

710
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,960
think but thanks kind of people managed

711
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,880
to get it working

712
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,120
what this does is actually actually for

713
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,120
the london building screen

714
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,559
dumps a jsp file i'm a top cat server so

715
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,279
this is only vulnerable if you're

716
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,120
running spring that's right

717
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,199
uh way back on actual tomcats

718
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,640
and it does

719
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,960
jsp basically whatever you

720
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:28,869
[Music]

721
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,930
um

722
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:35,009
[Music]

723
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,720
so the next thing we need to do

724
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,360
is actually write

725
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,480
um

726
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,260
[Music]

727
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,660
[Music]

728
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,720
oh

729
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,150
[Music]

730
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,039
so what i'm going um do now is

731
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,559
run the exploits so this is going to

732
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,840
send off the request to the server

733
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,399
with the command camera

734
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,320
and if it's successful we should get the

735
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,360
user that it's running as

736
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,519
fingers crossed

737
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,080
there we go yeah it works

738
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,960
so

739
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,840
we're going to review i'm running

740
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,200
that root

741
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,880
so i can do

742
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,230
uh

743
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,339
[Music]

744
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,080
[Music]

745
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,840
probably a bit slow

746
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,799
come on there we go yeah um so that is

747
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,639
full remote code execution

748
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,039
now whether this can happen with uh out

749
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,919
authentication now i don't know um

750
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,919
just my medium

751
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,640
i think it could possibly be so

752
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,480
it uses

753
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,320
the combination of the header and post

754
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,039
bodies in that

755
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,889
[Music]

756
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,799
as you can see this is pretty

757
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,799
significant and this was just found on

758
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,880
the screen so the point is there's all

759
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,799
these vulnerabilities out there and

760
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,960
is

761
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,760
so coming back to those first

762
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,599
impressions are so many beginnings

763
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,839
would you allow someone to remind

764
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,839
some random stranger along the streets

765
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,239
around uh

766
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,079
i'm talking about the problem

767
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,240
you yes or no

768
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,440
no yeah

769
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,800
so

770
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
why are we then just putting

771
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,280
stuff from a repository where we don't

772
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,440
even know the person we've never seen

773
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,400
them

774
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,480
there's no difference right we are

775
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,240
literally just pointing forward from the

776
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,760
internet

777
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,960
off uh without any validation go ahead

778
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,040
and look at that very dash that's a good

779
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,440
example no validation mean that if there

780
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,720
was then people wouldn't be diagnosed

781
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:42,309
[Music]

782
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,079
we just need to verify the whole

783
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,240
transfer verify so

784
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,040
libraries that you are using in your

785
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,240
software

786
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,319
try to do at least a rough review of it

787
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,839
and then from an attacker point of view

788
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,240
would you want to spend hours and a

789
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,760
whole bunch of effort trying to get

790
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,920
through to an organization

791
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920
when you can do something like

792
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
create a malicious package

793
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,920
and then get immediately inserted into

794
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,000
an organization

795
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,800
or many organizations

796
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,880
with relatively

797
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,720
little effort

798
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,240
and you're going to get

799
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,640
straight away and much better escalated

800
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,680
privilege

801
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,440
with blood effort so it's going to be

802
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,359
running in a production environment

803
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,720
possibly

804
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,680
with privileged access to customer data

805
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,599
obviously preparing your notification

806
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,920
your target but from attacker point of

807
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,119
view it's a great way to

808
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,560
the other problem is there's just

809
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,079
because of that wealth or that volume

810
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,599
and you're talking about if you know it

811
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,000
would be every single time uh sorry

812
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,280
every line of code you're talking about

813
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,560
thousands of lines possibly per um

814
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,040
dependency and then the dependencies

815
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,680
have low independent seasons gets messed

816
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,760
so trying to manually review every one

817
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,680
of the quotes it's not feasible

818
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,440
so you've got this paralegal and

819
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,720
haystack type of thing try to find that

820
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,520
snippet of code that's hiding in your

821
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,079
massive wealth of code

822
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,119
it's going to be really difficult

823
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,599
so

824
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,920
just ending off

825
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,119
i think

826
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,640
the closing thing i

827
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,720
would like to say

828
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,000
while

829
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,920
it's going to be difficult to tackle

830
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,440
this problem

831
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,280
and there's different things out there

832
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,040
such as google cells that are that

833
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,800
aren't trying to look at tackling this

834
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,280
problem we have to start with somewhere

835
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,240
and if

836
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,320
going back to the way we approach things

837
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,200
like blood

838
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,640
about

839
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,560
we're not even starting off there we're

840
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,680
still doing the old things so our view

841
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,400
is

842
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
if we can just start looking at using

843
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,800
things like seas that's a good starting

844
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,960
point that's going to put us in a good

845
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,920
position to get you forward and have

846
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,680
anything else that comes up with you

847
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,680
talk about the

848
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,480
uh authors and different dependencies

849
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,079
and all that kind of thing

850
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,920
so we just need sort of somewhere

851
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,079
looking at this tuning in

852
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,320
it's not cost prohibitive

853
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,720
so we shouldn't be here and

854
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,920
so

855
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,920
thank you um

856
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,640
been great to give this talk to you and

857
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,119
finally talk to people's faces rather

858
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,119
than some webcam

859
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,960
which has been fantastic

860
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,119
and yeah any questions

861
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,119
yeah

862
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,279
you kept that

863
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,480
the majority of organizations have got

864
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,880
zero control over their code

865
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,480
so how are they gonna

866
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,040
do this

867
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,760
it's all compiled

868
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,280
uh what do you mean zero

869
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,249
[Music]

870
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,320
is

871
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:39,520
[Music]

872
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,760
this is where you can start holding

873
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,480
vendors to account so things like when

874
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,280
spring or love for j comes up you start

875
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,440
posing those questions to those edits

876
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,520
what are you doing about this how are

877
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,359
you protecting me

878
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,520
um and then also looking have things

879
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,599
like security advice and each of those

880
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,599
vendors it's a really good case because

881
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,599
it shouldn't start if they are affected

882
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,440
by that they should or even if they're

883
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,359
unaffected by us they shouldn't have

884
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,160
some run up informing their users of how

885
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,240
they're reacting to it what their users

886
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,799
need to do

887
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,880
so um

888
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,720
um

889
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,520
yeah so

890
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,680
i think

891
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,000
the trouble is with vulnerable learnings

892
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,240
and malicious packages right so in

893
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,640
camera i could be wrong but as far as i

894
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,880
know they don't remove vulnerable

895
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,640
versions from their repositories if they

896
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,319
did they'll probably break a whole bunch

897
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,359
of things

898
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,280
malicious packages there's obviously a

899
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,800
very

900
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,200
dire

901
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,119
this is why

902
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,520
organizations need to invest in their

903
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,359
own repositories

904
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,359
so they can have control

905
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,520
and there are tools like sign up

906
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,440
firewall we can start sending some

907
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,640
policies

908
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,040
um using one organization it's really

909
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,720
great we can start saying our policies

910
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,800
where you kind of get called about those

911
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,920
versions

912
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,599
but there's also just another important

913
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,880
thing that many people forget

914
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,599
package is a lot of the dependencies are

915
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,800
cash

916
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,079
so it's all very right we have this

917
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,599
malicious packages and something like

918
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,680
the mpm let's pull it to your private

919
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,040
repository

920
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,640
that's not very very well so you

921
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,800
physically remove that

922
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,680
yeah you remove it from that repository

923
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,839
uh and then having things like scholarly

924
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,880
or constantly monitoring so this is

925
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,860
you could argue that the composition

926
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,280
[Music]

927
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,040
managers could do

928
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,400
more to help

929
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,140
but um

930
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,480
[Music]

931
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,280
it's

932
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,800
it's a difficult one but all the

933
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,880
organizations ready to take control of

934
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,880
this

935
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,219
[Music]

936
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,150
[Music]

937
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,960
[Music]

938
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,910
[Music]

939
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:57,388
[Music]

940
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:16,179
[Music]

941
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:24,720
[Music]

942
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,400
unfortunately reported i wish they did

943
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,240
they would include some examples but i

944
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,720
don't just say yeah this is the biggest

945
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,960
so i'm telling you what you're saying

946
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,880
especially if it's an internal uh

947
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,560
package you have to kind of create it

948
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,280
exactly the same otherwise

949
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,839
the long vowels um i think sometimes

950
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,680
organizations build their own internal

951
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,560
packages as well i know google does

952
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,720
themselves they don't actually download

953
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,160
packages so obviously

954
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,280
um the building is only so

955
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,520
that could maybe be a way to get access

956
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,240
to the source code results

957
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,240
but unfortunately i don't know i just

958
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,160
know that someone's talking about it

959
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,879
says the largest

960
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:12,199
[Music]

961
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,280
all right well

962
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,090
thanks android

963
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:26,109
