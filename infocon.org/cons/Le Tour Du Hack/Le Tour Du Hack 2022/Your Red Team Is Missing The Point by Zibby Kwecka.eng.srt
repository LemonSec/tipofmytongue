i have much more friends

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,719

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,719
crowd you know and that's the reason i

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,440
want to talk to you

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,879
so

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,360
the subject of this talk is your team

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,640
your writing is missing the point

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,680
and who am i i tend to introduce myself

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,320
as the forest gump of scottish cyber

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,200
because

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,960
just like on this photo for us i'm

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,640
starting next to the kennedy you know

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,360
i've been in most of the places where

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,200
important things happened in scotland

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,320
cyber

41
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,240
so you know fatty was supposed to be

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,360
talking to you just you know an hour ago

43
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,079
and so it happens that they hired me 11

44
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,560
years ago i worked with him in a company

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,159
called bhakta that become easier

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,479
security we've created the first song

47
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,280
for one of the uk banks first cybersoft

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,920
or one of these banks together with many

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,079
other goods people there

50
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,960
then i went on to other banks i was a

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,520
person that got the first

52
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,840
global splunk instance into one of the

53
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,079
major scottish banks the other one of

54
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,840
the two

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,280
and

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,759
you know so that's me what i'm doing now

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,439
i'm the head of information security at

58
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,520
heineken you probably know the brand you

59
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,280
probably don't know we've got about 300

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,119
different brands under that name

61
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,879
and why i'm here

62
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,280
is because over the years working in

63
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,560
many companies including kpmg where i

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,160
run all the

65
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,480
red not red teams all the offensive

66
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,720
security for scotland i manage their

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640
engagements i never told pentester

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,280
myself but i run all the engagements i

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
work for many organizations where i was

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,239
on the receiving end of the engagement

71
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,640
and you know what

72
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,560
i would say five percent of them were

73
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,599
good

74
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,519
most of the time

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,040
the engagement was terrible

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,319
unfortunately it's got better it's

77
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,599
getting better it's getting better

78
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,160
through like ben sally the community

79
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,920
working together people working together

80
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,840
and getting better

81
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,720
so

82
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,480
i also before this talks talk to a

83
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,040
number of seasons other siso is a number

84
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,879
of head of security and

85
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,040
what they say is scary to me

86
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,959
because one of the statements here is

87
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,920
like i'm just going to do without any

88
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,680
pen testers for the teamers now it's

89
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,800
like

90
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,720
there is so much troubles with what

91
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,159
we're getting right now that we're just

92
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,400
going to go the automated route unlike

93
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,040
you know right now

94
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,959
i would be waiting almost for somebody

95
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,720
to do me from the audience and say come

96
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,440
on you cannot run a red team

97
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,360
as an automation you need intelligence

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
you need something more than just an

99
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,599
automated program to run a red team

100
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,400
but here it is as spoke to one of the

101
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
guys leading

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,440
quite a big team of experts and he's

103
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,280
like yeah i can't deal with it anymore i

104
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,959
just want to go for roblox

105
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,239
so just to make sure i don't say this

106
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,840
talk from just one perspective the

107
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,080
perspective of the person who manage the

108
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
engagement and

109
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,519
you know

110
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,599
is on the receiving end of those reports

111
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,760
and engagements i also talked to some of

112
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,959
my friends and that's the power of

113
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,239
community you know i reached out to

114
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,879
those three guys last tuesday and within

115
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,720
you know an hour or two

116
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,319
i had you know

117
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,159
interview schedule with them to talk to

118
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,920
them about their perception as

119
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,120
rentingers

120
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,238
so aaron here is a very young guy

121
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,160
he is looking quite like when you see

122
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,000
him he's still quite young but within

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,680
four years for graduating of the

124
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,840
university undergraduate course he's

125
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,080
already a manager at kpmg doing

126
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,840
offensive security he's doing something

127
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,360
wrong right

128
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,880
not wrong

129
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,680
uh and actually that's opposite to some

130
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,320
of the other stories

131
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,479
who is exactly a work we've done before

132
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,720
in secures or a company called dns that

133
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,680
was here in 2009 and congrats who i also

134
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
met through kpmg there is one more pbr

135
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,560
i'm going to introduce later uh also

136
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,720
from the same area but you know always

137
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,040
question where people is where the

138
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,720
person talking to you is taking their

139
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,639
sources from do they actually know what

140
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,240
they're talking about

141
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,040
uh

142
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,520
so the question is can robots replace

143
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,680
the direct immersion and whenever you

144
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,280
see a heading like that in the newspaper

145
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,199
the automatic answer is no

146
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,639
somebody will be sure of the heading

147
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,800
they would

148
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,720
i don't believe robots can replace your

149
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,160
teamers

150
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,919
and

151
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,759
for everybody here who doesn't exactly

152
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,080
know who the reckoning is

153
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,400
and also because i believe that whenever

154
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,240
you are in a room you're explaining it

155
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,440
whatever you're talking about to

156
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,080
everybody including my daughter here so

157
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,039
you're

158
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,639
explaining something to the 12 year old

159
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,560
in this case and that's almost the

160
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,360
attention span of the senior executives

161
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,520
in any organization i've seen

162
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,000
if you're showing them a pentest report

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,560
they will only look at it for about a

164
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,919
minute and it's like

165
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,880
enough i'm back to my business stuff

166
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,080
so ready for those who don't know

167
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,639
is the stealthy way of testing an

168
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,160
organization making sure that the

169
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,880
protocols in the place to detect

170
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,840
uh

171
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,560
an offender without our adversary within

172
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,600
the organization are all right

173
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,520
and how it's different for variable

174
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,360
testing you know bernabeu testing you

175
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,840
would have a scheduled test by a machine

176
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,520
and in the red team you get to the point

177
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,800
that the stealth

178
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,800
very sophisticated attack

179
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,280
so

180
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,360
let's talk here to a few engagements

181
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,600
that i've discussed with my friends and

182
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,280
the engagements i've been on some of

183
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,680
them are not exactly real they're made

184
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,160
up of few different stories punched

185
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,479
together to fight a movie on netflix but

186
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,160
that's hopefully will give you a little

187
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,759
bit of a flavor of what we're talking

188
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,000
about so imagine you're an already

189
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,319
you're outside this fortress here

190
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,319
that's actually probably you can

191
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,919
probably recognize it from the gates of

192
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,039
trucks

193
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,120
but you're outside of this fortress

194
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,759
probably on the smaller wall there

195
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,080
armed you've got plenty of offensive

196
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,039
tools

197
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,560
you're ready for the action you need to

198
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,120
get in to the fortress find the crown

199
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,639
jewels

200
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,840
get the mount

201
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,520
undetected you're being told

202
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,240
that the season there is quite tough

203
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
you know the thing there is ready for

204
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,160
you the blue teamers have been through

205
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,880
it

206
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,400
plenty of time

207
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,880
they're not afraid of you

208
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,319
you just say hold my beer

209
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,199
so

210
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,520
you go in and actually it's like they

211
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,199
weren't ready at all it's an easy

212
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,520
scenario you do some awesome for you

213
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,400
know a day or two you sent a few emails

214
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,199
and then you know in half a day or less

215
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,120
you've got elevated access through some

216
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,360
dll injection because somebody had input

217
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,160
calls around their path parameters

218
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,520
and then

219
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
you're getting to domain admin 20

220
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,360
minutes because you

221
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,720
you attack the land manager and and you

222
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,080
know provide some spoofing on the

223
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,560
network so

224
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
uh you know

225
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,319
you got it you're there 20 minutes into

226
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,720
engagement pretty much

227
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,120
people who are paying 50 000 pounds 100

228
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,879
000 pounds for it and you've done it

229
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,879
within 20 minutes of that's why it's

230
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,120
starting to warm up so you spend another

231
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,360
two weeks doing something attacking that

232
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,120
may not be another way

233
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,160
you write a report and you think cecil

234
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,199
will fight when they see

235
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,000
and then your report looks like that

236
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,960
you know

237
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,720
nothing intelligence about it there is

238
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,639
very little information that somebody

239
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,720
can gain from it or actually

240
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
you're telling somebody that oh that's

241
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,639
your biggest problem

242
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,400
that's the critical vulnerability it's

243
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,240
the biggest thing you've got there

244
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,679
but you don't understand the playing

245
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,319
field you don't understand

246
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,599
almost a good scenario because it took

247
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,240
you not that long to get here

248
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,480
but what about the hydra scenarios again

249
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,279
you're standing outside this fortress

250
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,279
and you can't get in

251
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,800
you've been trying fishing campaigns

252
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,360
you're try to go on site and do some

253
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,399
physical

254
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,640
access to the building to actually get

255
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,760
any sort of a basic level access

256
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
and you can't get it you spend two weeks

257
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,360
to it and only one person clicks

258
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,440
something finally

259
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,040
you've got these

260
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,640
initial access

261
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,480
and it moves from there

262
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,080
you spent two weeks so you buried about

263
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,320
50k doing it

264
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,480
so what do you do you time to your best

265
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,920
caller in the organization the best

266
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,399
penetration tester and say we need

267
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,000
something big we need to show that we

268
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,920
can't just tell them it took so long

269
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,680
that we didn't get nothing

270
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,560
so they spent two nights rewriting

271
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,320
you know some of the templates in

272
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,120
cobalt's strike or mata

273
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,720
and then deployed silently and goes in

274
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
it goes in quietly

275
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,600
you go

276
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,320
and go everything you want actually goes

277
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,440
so well

278
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,959
that you're doing

279
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,480
a dc sync

280
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,080
you're syncing all the data from the

281
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,640
domain controller to your laptop

282
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,920
and then

283
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,760
also for the google hit

284
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,200
you can get the databases but what

285
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,279
you've done thinking that this is

286
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,279
dc

287
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,959
you feel like harry potter getting their

288
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,760
first snitch because you actually have a

289
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,279
golden ticket

290
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,440
you can now issue any authentication

291
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,240
ticket within the environment

292
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,640
great that sounds amazing and you've

293
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,360
done the databases because that's just

294
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,079
for a good measure so you feel like that

295
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,680
you feel like avengers your king is

296
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,800
ready for the deep leave

297
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,240
but you can probably see it online i'll

298
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,040
link to it later is

299
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
unless you you want to do you like that

300
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,440
i'll get this one if you haven't seen it

301
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
hope it will play

302
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,160
i just didn't know how loud

303
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,640
um

304
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,959
[Music]

305
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,680
yeah if you haven't seen this video go

306
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,160
go on youtube search you know

307
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,040
for offensive security or you know pen

308
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
test and then see so you'll get it it's

309
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,240
a beautiful spoof of that classic movie

310
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,000
uh but what happens you're actually

311
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,920
going to the building

312
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,480
uh to go get the deep breath with the

313
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,399
blue team and what's happening they're

314
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,000
not taking you the normal path that you

315
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,440
would expect you're going so dark

316
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,279
corridors you're not

317
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,920
going to the normal conference room

318
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,560
what turns out is you're ending up

319
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,160
in uh ciso's incident response rooms

320
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,920
what's happening there you look at the

321
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,600
people there and there is a lot of tired

322
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,440
faces

323
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,120
and it goes on here

324
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,160
nobody told them he's a red team

325
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,079
cecil did we know nobody in the team do

326
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,399
you know

327
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,240
you've got some video conference call

328
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,600
going on

329
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,839
and you

330
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,519
recognize you know the email addresses

331
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,200
that are shown on the screen is one of

332
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
the epr companies

333
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,440
crowdstrike or you know microsoft or

334
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,120
somebody else

335
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,800
and they they look like they want to

336
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,360
swear at you but they only say

337
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,120
the adversary wouldn't play that way

338
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,320
it's an unfair game

339
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,000
and you again it zones on you siso would

340
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,079
not call the red team

341
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,920
they only do it in the first hundred

342
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,839
days of their work

343
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,279
because

344
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,040
yes firsthand the day they want to show

345
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,800
how bad it is but after that they

346
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,200
totally want somebody to come and throw

347
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,639
everything that they've got at the

348
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,800
company

349
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,880
it just doesn't make sense for them

350
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,360
but you laugh it off you say

351
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
i will write a report

352
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,720
and show to them

353
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,279
how bad they are

354
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,880
you spend two weeks

355
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
then another two weeks to get the report

356
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,760
authorized and finally

357
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,600
the report goes to the season and again

358
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,120
it looks like that he's patching doesn't

359
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,519
really show food pizza

360
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,360
we're back to square one

361
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,600
then what cecil needs to do

362
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,920
they actually need to spend another week

363
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,000
writing a report or actually cso's team

364
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,600
writes the report that cso will

365
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,959
understand

366
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,279
because your report wasn't that good

367
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,560
and then

368
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,079
the same week they're writing a report

369
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,240
for the exits because they can't show

370
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,880
the exact

371
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,839
the vendor told us they've got such a

372
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,240
good detection on that in the database

373
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,639
and nobody can do without them normally

374
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,320
now they're gonna have to buy us another

375
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,199
tool

376
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,279
on the cost because that's the contracts

377
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,279
with those people

378
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,760
but actually that's the end of my talk

379
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,079
at the end of the wedding if that's how

380
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,920
the right things are perceived

381
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,120
you're not gonna get a lot of

382
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,240
engagements

383
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,839
there is no community there you go there

384
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,440
and actually they want to walk you off

385
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,000
the building rather than say good job

386
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,279
and it's not the feeling you want to

387
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,920
have you want to be encouraged you want

388
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
to have those high fives and saying you

389
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
don't drive thank you no you're not

390
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,959
going to get it after engagement like

391
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,519
that so how do we assure a survival of

392
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,440
directly how do we do it

393
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,839
what can we do

394
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,440
first of all

395
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,920
when you're starting an engagement

396
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,040
verify the maturity of the bluetooth

397
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,680
don't trust what they say actually go

398
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
speak to the teams find out what they're

399
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,639
doing how much you they are

400
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,920
actually it was quite beautiful you

401
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,839
parked here

402
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,199
when i submitted

403
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,639
the idea for that talk at the very

404
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,279
beginning of march a few days later

405
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,120
rachel had brought that on twitter

406
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,760
saying that she will not do an offensive

407
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,839
engagement with the company

408
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,760
if they're not mature enough she will

409
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,360
come around and help them with the basic

410
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,399
processes and so on but she won't do an

411
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,320
offensive engagement just doesn't make

412
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,040
sense they're wasting their money

413
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,560
and at the end of it everybody is going

414
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,880
to be frustrated and annoyed

415
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,920
and also

416
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,880
thomson don't start from scratch

417
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,040
don't always start from that fishing and

418
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,240
elevating accident everything

419
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,760
sometimes you will spend two weeks and

420
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,920
burn to 50k just to get through your

421
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,160
initial access

422
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,199
market

423
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,959
and assume that certain things can be

424
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:25,760
done

425
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,440
so start at that position when you're

426
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
already authenticated users and started

427
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,440
from there or start from a position

428
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,199
where you're a third party that has some

429
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,639
access to this company and start from

430
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,440
there don't assume that every right you

431
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,360
need to start from scratch that need to

432
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,440
start from external positions from that

433
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,480
boat outside the grove

434
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,279
also who is the train actor

435
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,360
who are who is that company playing

436
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,480
against or defending the descent of rome

437
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,279
is it a nation state

438
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,120
outside of what happened right now in

439
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,040
the world and even now

440
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,759
nation states don't usually attack

441
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,160
companies unless you're talking about

442
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,399
you know some very small nation states

443
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,839
that are starved of money and they

444
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,519
actually hacking people to get money for

445
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,360
branson where they do it but they use

446
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,279
community tools

447
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,279
uh organized kind that's probably the

448
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,160
best and the biggest one here that's the

449
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,399
guys that actually

450
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,320
are after everybody and everybody's mind

451
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,399
is very enough activists

452
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,560
not all organizations

453
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,720
i you know i would hope that you know my

454
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,320
organization for example i really hope

455
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,160
we're trying to do good we're trying to

456
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,759
do great things we're trying to be

457
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,199
actually good people and that's what

458
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,079
this

459
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,890
context has to turkey degree from

460
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,399
[Music]

461
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,600
the you know

462
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,680
activists and i remember

463
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
guys from google telling me okay what do

464
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,759
you do about them what do you do about

465
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,240
insider threat that's the last one here

466
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,399
and they say we're trying to be the good

467
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,320
employer we're trying to listen to

468
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
people we're trying to actually do what

469
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,560
majors want to do so you can avoid

470
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,800
certain things depending on

471
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,640
who's your attacker but find out

472
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,480
who you should be simulating in your

473
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,559
wedding

474
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,959
so if your rating looks like they're in

475
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,079
pop but actually the attacker is a 16

476
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,199
year old guy somewhere in oxford

477
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,199
that actually needs to google meme hats

478
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,039
and the guys on the top will drive being

479
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,240
apps

480
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,079
the already is a bit you know

481
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,919
overpowered compared to what is

482
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,880
necessary for that client

483
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,480
and play fair exactly find out what the

484
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,840
client needs

485
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,480
what is the maturity and play fair you

486
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,880
don't want the edr vendo to say

487
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,919
you know what we watch hundreds of

488
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,360
thousands of logs from the real attacks

489
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,919
nobody ever moved like those guys nobody

490
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,919
ever behaved like those scouts because

491
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,679
red teamers have a slightly different

492
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,240
step around the environment

493
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,039
than

494
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,880
the proper adversary they move slightly

495
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,760
different

496
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,840
obviously one day somebody may get

497
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,200
caught out of that they actually invoke

498
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,799
the death and redeemers they're

499
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,960
detecting

500
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,720
the adversaries but

501
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,640
she'll try to play fair

502
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,880
and and also going back to the french

503
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,200
intelligence

504
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
for example and i say that on the bottom

505
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,400
there

506
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,160
find out what is the threat intelligence

507
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,919
given to the blue team

508
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,600
and sometimes

509
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,679
players scenario exactly to the threat

510
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,360
inventions they've been given you're

511
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
taking told that there is a certain way

512
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,640
of attacking organizations like theirs

513
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
try to see whether they protected

514
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,000
themselves from

515
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,240
and if they haven't they actually do

516
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,960
something really good

517
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,240
okay

518
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,760
also never think less of your opponents

519
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,280
their bluetooth they don't usually

520
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,039
become conferences

521
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,280
often now now it's a bit more or they

522
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,120
haven't usually spoken conferences and

523
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,039
the reason for it was they couldn't they

524
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,960
had guide orders they had you know they

525
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,799
would lose their job and speak too much

526
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,240
about their jobs

527
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,080
so it's not that they're not intelligent

528
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
or not that good there actually is very

529
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
hot people in the center

530
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,240
but they can't talk about review they

531
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,520
can talk about it with other

532
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,360
but learn a little bit about their jobs

533
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,160
do as a comment detection response or

534
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,240
risk on a learnable text then how to

535
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,840
speak to the senior management is a

536
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,799
skill offer right along right teams

537
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,320
and go

538
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,760
with the time between the chances with

539
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,080
the bluetooth

540
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,160
and never

541
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,760
go a little bit over the board with your

542
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,880
findings

543
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,480
a lot of the time you read the findings

544
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,679
and it's like

545
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,840
you guys gonna die this company is going

546
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,240
to case to exist if this you know if you

547
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,520
allow an attack like that to go through

548
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,320
and that's not actually the case

549
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,640
10 top companies before the way the

550
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,960
company is done companies die from the

551
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,360
lack of cash

552
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,760
they don't usually die even after a huge

553
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,600
cyber attack they don't usually die

554
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,320
immediately they run for a few years and

555
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,000
if the cash flow doesn't prove that's

556
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,360
when they died

557
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,120
but looking at mars they had an attack

558
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,000
in 2017. someone on the left

559
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,360
not petty a white you know what 25 000

560
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,080
pcs 4 000 servers

561
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,880
within 10 days that's what happened to

562
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,200
them they lost 300 millions you know

563
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,520
recovering that

564
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,960
but they're actually

565
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,320
doing very well in 2022

566
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,280
an attack that cost them 300 millions

567
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,039
provide pretty much the whole companies

568
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,720
they survived so it's about the cash

569
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,039
flows you don't

570
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,480
have offering their findings

571
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
specifically trying to get a business

572
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,039
impact what would be a business product

573
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,039
that you just carried out often people

574
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,440
go after domain servers

575
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,720
but you know in my company we work in

576
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,400
uh we got an ot environment that is

577
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,000
totally separate

578
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
i can't hear you about domain name most

579
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,280
of the time because you can't get

580
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,960
another one out of it so

581
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,080
also agree your findings with bluetooth

582
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,720
if you've got something that don't agree

583
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,880
with the other side guess what the

584
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,799
stakeholders on the top are not going to

585
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,840
be there

586
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,760
to know what is good and what is bad no

587
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
matter how you look in words they won't

588
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,520
understand it you need to agree your

589
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,000
findings with your opponents

590
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
and if you don't

591
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,440
then the trust is lost on both sides

592
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,840
people will start trusting you and start

593
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,240
this thought stop trusting you and stop

594
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,400
trusting the rooting

595
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,679
and don't do

596
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,480
the disease thing it's pretty much evil

597
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,600
you can

598
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,200
break the environment pretty easily

599
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,000
and

600
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,480
actually in the story earlier i say what

601
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,960
could have happened if you made a dc6

602
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,360
left it on your virtual machine or even

603
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,840
worse left it on a usb drive connected

604
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,080
to your laptop because you thought

605
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,600
after each engagement i would just have

606
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,960
you have a usb

607
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,440
and keep all the data from there if you

608
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,840
made a dc sync take some databases put

609
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,919
it on the usb that you haven't encrypted

610
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,840
and you lose it in the hotel room in

611
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,080
real two weeks later that company could

612
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,320
be breached or that data could be on the

613
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,679
dark web or

614
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,080
reddit whatever you call it

615
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,080
uh so

616
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,799
make sure that if you do a dc sync you

617
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,799
take some gold tickets

618
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,640
delete it securely after your engagement

619
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,760
don't keep it on your vms okay i'll

620
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,600
no you don't have the right to use it if

621
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,720
you're going to go for another

622
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,840
engagement you're going to have to start

623
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,240
from scratch that's your job

624
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,679
so

625
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,400
know your audience

626
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,919
when you write your report not like at

627
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,280
the university

628
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,039
the exact summary is actually for the

629
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,400
exact it needs to be understood by

630
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,919
somebody who's got two minutes to read

631
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,520
that report

632
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,440
the technical summary is more for you

633
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,840
know the season and finally the body of

634
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,600
the report is going to be for everybody

635
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,480
else working for this issue

636
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,840
but there is still the need for

637
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,760
directing sometimes

638
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,240
if the company does not believe

639
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,400
that they can be reached if the cso is

640
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,280
so

641
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,400
full of himself saying i know whatever

642
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,320
that's when you want a red tip and shake

643
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,520
the whole thing

644
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,600
that's where you want to actually

645
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,120
um

646
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,760
go for it and do something

647
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,679
very offensive

648
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,440
in other cases

649
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,200
and actually i got it here but i won't

650
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,520
tweet it the the definition of the red

651
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,039
team i read earlier wasn't full

652
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,640
definition it's actually from the same

653
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,679
article

654
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,520
but this one is better it's a rigorous

655
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,679
challenging plan policy systems and

656
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,159
assumptions but approaching that others

657
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,840
are approached as a much better

658
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,159
definition of all directives

659
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,039
but what i'm suggesting is from now on

660
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,520
try to avoid doing writing

661
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,520
especially for any low maturity clients

662
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,440
just don't do it unless you're talking

663
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,200
about netflix or somebody who throws

664
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,279
direct things of themselves every day

665
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,919
and actually simulator adverts are there

666
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,520
every day

667
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,679
do it then but for most of the times go

668
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,760
for a taco team go for those right

669
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,400
alongside teams go for being the chances

670
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,200
with the blue team so we can actually

671
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,840
see what's going on in some of the

672
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,520
engagements that i talked about earlier

673
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,880
the problems

674
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,640
you do attack somebody for two weeks you

675
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,120
take two weeks to report on it and four

676
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,279
weeks later there is no

677
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,679
log in the tools

678
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,600
that actually show why the alerts did

679
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,120
not trigger

680
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,880
so the whole two weeks of the award is

681
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,400
pretty much wasted because they don't

682
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,240
know how to detect it the next time and

683
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,440
that's the cool

684
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,200
idea of why you want to be there that's

685
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,720
why they want their wedding so they know

686
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,600
how to detect somebody next time

687
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,320
so

688
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,559
long be the red team

689
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,240
but now how do we get five the higher

690
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,400
key not fire so i guess i didn't have a

691
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,240
coffin this morning yet hopefully i'll

692
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,600
get one after that

693
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,240
so again being where i am i'm very lucky

694
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,559
to have hundreds of people applying for

695
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,600
jobs that i put online i'm really very

696
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,360
happy about this position i'm very happy

697
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,440
how many people we got applying for

698
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,279
those positions how many talented people

699
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,960
we've got in scotland

700
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,120
and you know whenever i get it most of

701
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,360
the cvs 90 of them

702
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,360
people will be talking about offensive

703
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,279
security mostly

704
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,400
but obviously i can't offer a job in my

705
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,840
organization that is hundred percent

706
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,200
offensive security it's not what i do

707
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,760
i'm more about defending my organization

708
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,600
so

709
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,320
what i try to do is gary

710
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,200
last time we got the interviews

711
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,919
uh we got all the cds and initially they

712
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,320
were down to three candidates

713
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,679
and we had three face-to-face interviews

714
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,480
and out of the three two people turn up

715
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
very full of themselves

716
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,480
as their guys he's like

717
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,760
especially one he was like

718
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,039
yeah see

719
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,600
i'd never done a proper award but i had

720
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,799
that client there i don't know

721
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,159
penetration

722
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,320
for them but they are useless you know

723
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,000
they can't defend themselves anything

724
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
don't talk like that about your clients

725
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,720
be

726
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,440
be a nice person be you know somebody

727
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,080
who is agreeable and you can talk to you

728
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,400
there is a quite good

729
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,880
maybe not always good but there's a

730
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,240
seasonal

731
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,360
uh

732
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,919
it's a cso podcast and in that podcast

733
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,840
one of the presenters is always ask

734
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,279
would you hire a brilliant check

735
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,880
and the answer no matter what they think

736
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
they usually need if you do options i

737
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,360
really enjoy or have something worth

738
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,840
taking every time you go for the other

739
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
option because once you get somebody who

740
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,880
is a little bit annoying into the team

741
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,120
the whole team disappears the whole team

742
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,880
gets a big flight defensively and

743
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,480
they're like all starting off to each

744
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,520
other in

745
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,840
you know peacocks and what teddy and

746
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,360
then wanted to talk about earlier they

747
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,120
have talked about it you want this

748
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,960
community you want friendly faces you

749
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,120
want to open up and be able to talk like

750
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,679
human to human and learn from each other

751
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,440
so last year before i hired this guy leo

752
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,679
he came in he really focused on offenses

753
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,039
he really wanted to do offensive

754
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,520
security i couldn't initially offer that

755
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,559
to him

756
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,520
but he called him very open-minded

757
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,600
he uh done an internship over three

758
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,880
months with me

759
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,120
uh i found some offensive security

760
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,880
engagement i could sell him on he had

761
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,720
passion for brewing so i also sent him

762
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,039
to our living room

763
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,799
and also to know manchester brewery who

764
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,480
is that is a bit more automated than

765
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,640
that

766
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,720
and he really enjoyed he learned about

767
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
both sides of security not just

768
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,799
offensive also defensive and reporting

769
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,000
and actually speaking to senior

770
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,200
stakeholders

771
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
and from there on he i offered him

772
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,279
opportunities to talk to the pet testers

773
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,120
i know so he could learn more about the

774
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,080
craft and get the jobs he could view

775
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,440
actually at the back of the internship

776
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,080
just because he was such a nice and

777
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,080
he had three jobs offered to choose from

778
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,600
and he selected one in switzerland

779
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,840
so

780
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,720
in order to be where you want to be

781
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,559
look at job adverts look at other people

782
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,240
look where you want to be in five years

783
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
time you don't have to look further than

784
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
that outside in five years time who you

785
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,360
want to be

786
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,520
check what is required and get it and i

787
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,279
know that you know arnold here probably

788
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,200
look at the top of the form

789
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,919
he

790
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,440
i read his biography and i really

791
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
recommended you reading history he is a

792
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,200
self-made guy that guy has you know had

793
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,000
an idea for himself he went to the

794
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,159
in in germany he was a bodybuilder of

795
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,120
course then he made

796
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,559
uh um

797
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,960
selling uh additives or foods and things

798
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,880
like that only then he went to states

799
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,320
and he thought he wants to be an actor

800
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,679
and he actually paid for some of those

801
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,520
movies himself that went to acting

802
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,640
classes

803
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,360
obviously you know he lost the world by

804
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,399
he was governor of california very good

805
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,039
title he's done some noise red teaming

806
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,919
exercises with his fire services one

807
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,520
year before the massive fires in

808
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,919
california that saved them

809
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,600
a lot

810
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,440
and finally from a guy that couldn't

811
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,919
speak properly in english about 20 years

812
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,840
ago and you could see him in the movies

813
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,919
he's like oh yeah

814
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,000
i'll be there

815
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,399
or i'll be back whatever because he

816
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,320
initially will say hercules that's a

817
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,240
nice nice thing

818
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,279
uh

819
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,480
in

820
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,080
if you see him two weeks ago he was

821
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,760
speaking to russians

822
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,080
and asked his fellows and the way

823
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,399
he eloquently put everything

824
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,640
you showed the chinese if you think that

825
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,640
right now i when i graduated from the

826
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,600
uni

827
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,679
you know i see myself being a little bit

828
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,520
close up i really focus on technical

829
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,080
stuff i really enjoy it i i really like

830
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,600
the technology i like

831
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,360
i got you know

832
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,120
packet tracing and understanding packets

833
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,640
to the big level

834
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,080
right you haven't seen many people that

835
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,880
actually would go that way

836
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,480
but then you want to group and you want

837
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,320
to find out where you want to be

838
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,720
and have a certain lifestyle

839
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,720
have a look and

840
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,440
don't limit yourself you can get there

841
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,360
it won't happen in the day it won't

842
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,120
happen new year but it will happen in

843
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,480
two three years

844
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
you will evolve to whoever you want to

845
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,640
be

846
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,039
what can help you in the journey those

847
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,159
four books

848
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,919
the ones that are tilted to one side are

849
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,120
more about

850
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,960
you know how you perceive the word and

851
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,279
how you can influence others and the one

852
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,000
that is to the right is

853
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
you if you want to discover what drives

854
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,039
you

855
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,480
and why you're doing certain things the

856
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,720
way you do as the laws of human nature

857
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
but actually if you want to

858
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,200
get on with people that's a good book it

859
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,360
kind of is recommended to a lot of

860
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,840
salesmen

861
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,679
but it's a brilliant book for everybody

862
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,960
it's a brilliant book about

863
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,120
understanding what other people want

864
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,200
people want to be called by their name

865
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,360
people want to be understood their hope

866
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,520
is understood somebody who can actually

867
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,360
be on the same line and you never should

868
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,279
do it in that book it's a rewarding huge

869
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,039
one you never do it

870
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,799
to sell something to people you do it

871
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,440
because genuinely you like people you

872
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,919
want to link to them

873
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,360
so be open-minded respect others

874
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,120
experiment as much as you can with

875
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,200
technology but also with people with

876
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,519
people interactions how you

877
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,039
sell something how you talk about

878
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,960
something how you discuss what you're

879
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,720
doing every day

880
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,919
explore

881
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,919
enjoy and share work with others have

882
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,200
fun

883
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,559
that's everything that's the end of the

884
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,870
book

885
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:28,559
[Applause]

886
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,799
i think i got a few minutes left

887
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,279
i i planned for 30 minutes and then i've

888
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,120
got few minutes more questions not any

889
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,720
questions do we talk for questions but

890
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,519
you may have something

891
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,559
no oh

892
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,120
material for money and others it looks

893
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,039
like they pretty much googled both of

894
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,360
the tools for for the things they were

895
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,919
very sophisticated for it and they

896
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,159
haven't covered the tracks very well so

897
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,360
i'm as i said i'm not a fancy security

898
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,519
person myself but from my perspective

899
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,000
it would mean that exactly you're not

900
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,960
throwing your best coders against the

901
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,559
organizations you want to embrace

902
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,039
somebody like

903
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,409

904

[Music]

905
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,919
what was your thoughts about it because

906
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,840
it's a two-way conversation would you

907
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,240
have a suggestion

908
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,919
i think

909
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,799
a six hour

910
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,720
[Music]

911
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,279
i see finally picking up but a lot of

912
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,320
bookings

913
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,799
comes you know friday afternoon

914
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,120
it's like okay i'm on holiday i'll i'll

915
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,360
have a pager and i sometimes look at

916
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,279
some pages but you know i won't look at

917
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,559
it until monday and i and what i i like

918
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,039
about your answer and the question is i

919
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,320
don't believe

920
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,799
and i run a lot of defensive operations

921
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,320
i don't believe anybody should be

922
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,559
running their own 100

923
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,320
inside sock

924
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,080
it's always going to be hybrid and

925
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,600
already it's hybrid because even when

926
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,600
they say it's hundred percent internal

927
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,720
you say what about those five

928
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,159
contractors there

929
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,840
so if you're hiring contractors you just

930
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,720
as well

931
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,240
hire a managed security service that

932
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,120
sees

933
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,519
offensive actions every day not people

934
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,600
that pick up something offensive every

935
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,799
three months so they don't have a

936
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,000
training they don't understand what's

937
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,960
going on

938
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,600
but that's that's how i see it

939
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,720
i suppose

940
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,640
i see a question from up there

941
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,960
yeah so you've explained about the

942
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,279
importance of writing your reporting for

943
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,440
executives and for your technical

944
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,560
summary

945
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,918
i actually think the bigger challenge

946
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,280
isn't trying to help the blue team

947
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,800
because the blue team is very close to

948
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,590
the red teams

949
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:24,219
[Music]

950
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,399
[Music]

951
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,440
uh you will find that after a while the

952
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,119
company will

953
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,960
cut down the resources and unfortunately

954
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,560
going to get to the point where you're

955
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,560
going to have to ride a cyber security

956
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,760
backhoe

957
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,199
with an important money it's not going

958
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,918
to be an improvement project or you

959
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,079
you ask for the money for the next year

960
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,839
but some of it is for planned

961
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,560
improvement projects and so for it is

962
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,640
you need to have some ad hoc improvement

963
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,280
projects because the network team

964
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,240
you know

965
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,000
won't do anything that is outside of

966
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,440
their budget because they don't have a

967
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,200
budget for it they will not gonna hire

968
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,240
anybody outside they don't have a budget

969
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,760
where it should come from is from the

970
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,440
security button on the security button

971
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,720
should come from the business and some

972
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,480
of it needs to be at home unfortunately

973
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,560
some of it needs to be a pot of money

974
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,599
that you really use and on an agile way

975
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,520
saying guys we just discovered something

976
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,839
new something bad is happening we don't

977
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,680
usually have the guys standing there to

978
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,839
fix it but we've got the pot of money to

979
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,520
help you so we can get this consultant

980
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,119
that we know that's been here you know

981
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,119
last month and actually she thought that

982
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,040
he can do it for us let's get him back

983

[Music]

984
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,689
[Music]

985
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,920
so

986
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,720
[Music]

987
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,480
but if a company doesn't want to spend

988
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,880
the money on cyber security and they

989
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,040
don't have regulated data they don't

990
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,680
have to do compliance it's their choice

991
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,640
because

992
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,960
you know there is a cost to security

993
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,119
there is a cost to managing risk this

994
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,079
will hold you back a little bit it's

995
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,040
it's

996
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,200
basically if you invest a little bit in

997
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,880
security

998
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,520
that can make sure that you actually

999
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,119
when you're gonna reach the top you're

1000
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,440
gonna stay on it

1001
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,280
but you're gonna slow you down a little

1002
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,400
bit because you're gonna have less

1003
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,240
pounds to invest in you getting to the

1004
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,320
top unless you're talking about you know

1005
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,440
speeding up

1006
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,520
user journey yes you can invest money in

1007
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,920
that and you can sell that to a company

1008
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,760
that if you invest in a user journey

1009
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,520
make it more secure but faster at the

1010
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,720
same time

1011
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,880
you cannot become more secure

1012
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,800
and actual better so what i do with

1013
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,680
organizations like that is you dress up

1014
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,160
and you don't just dress up you try

1015
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,720
to sell security with improvements to

1016
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,480
the business plan so you can have for

1017
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,119
example identity and say guys you can

1018
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,320
have identity for all of your customers

1019
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,920
and you know who they are you know their

1020
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,079
security you know they didn't connect

1021
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,079
you know their journey you know

1022
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,520
everything that you need to know as a

1023
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,200
business but also

1024
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,160
also they you know that you can secure

1025
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,079
their connections you know that you can

1026
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,160
securely authenticate them so

1027
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,680
that's the only approach i see in the

1028
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,960
scenario where the business doesn't

1029
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,640
really want to

1030
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,040
understand that cyber is important but

1031
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,160
also

1032
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,160
the the shock exercises that we just

1033
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,359
talked about

1034
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,960
i think that's a part of the right thing

1035
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,000
where

1036
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,320
actually you can go and shoot them a

1037
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,680
little bit you know

1038
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,520
that's why you need a retina somebody is

1039
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,680
like ah nothing gonna happen to us we

1040
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,520
don't care about it

1041
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,599
yeah that's when you mainly directly to

1042
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,680
show them what is bad or you may just uh

1043
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,599
you know a table from exercise to the

1044
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,720
board

1045
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,320
that's sometimes enough that's sometimes

1046
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,640
enough to get your body make a little

1047
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,599
tablet

1048
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,599
exercise get somebody who

1049
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,440
had been attracted but also a senior

1050
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,640
executive

1051
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,560
because they need to match the seniority

1052
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,200
of the people in the room

1053
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,880
and get them to talk to the board and

1054
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,119
tell them this is a story that's the

1055
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,680
story of tsb for example pretty much a

1056
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,680
local bank this wasn't a bridge but they

1057
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,599
told it to themselves but that's the

1058
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,359
story what happened after they had a

1059
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,160
huge

1060
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,560
you know disaster and that's what

1061
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,200
attacked personal attack it had on the

1062
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,160
exact because unfortunately

1063
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,000
most of the organization unless we talk

1064
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,800
about one thunder and small organization

1065
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,960
and most of the organization

1066
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,240
uh you know you need to sell and inform

1067
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,680
the individual

1068
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,280
as much as the business

1069
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,920
business is one thing but we've also got

1070
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,240
individual players in the board in the

1071
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,920
management team

1072
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,079
what's their aspirations do they want to

1073
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,320
be in this place in two years time five

1074
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,440
years time

1075
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,280
because if they only think in short term

1076
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,480
they're probably not going to spend for

1077
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,400
such cyber but if they're thinking i'm

1078
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,079
gonna be here in my ears that's the

1079
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,400
stakeholders you want to

1080
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,359
talk to

1081
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,040
that stakeholders that is going to be

1082
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,560
there in private time

1083
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
because they want the company to prosper

1084
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,480
and the chances that your company will

1085
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,200
have an attack in five years

1086
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,879
i would say i close to hundred percent

1087
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,119
that's that's my view any more questions

1088
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:20,640
[Music]

1089
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,799
all right

1090
