1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,080
as all of you know i'm ben

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,240
and this talks about internships and how

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,480
they can help students get experience in

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,840
it

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,320
this is from my own personal experience

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,520
not others

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,800
um

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,920
so it's

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,720
as i've experienced it and not how

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,720
it could potentially be for you for like

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,039
a future case for you guys

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,880
but i strongly recommend them let's

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,480
i told you is that

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,680
so yeah it says echo hello world in hex

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,520
um but it is convert to binary first

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,440
so about me i'm a first year student

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,640
here at napier

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640
i'm florida vaughan i'm a former

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,079
vodaform group cyber prevent intern

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,160
where i assisted in building their lab

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,280
network

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,640
helped develop

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,880
a dashboard for monitoring

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,920
for

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,000
his team over there

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,159
obviously camera gary hoskin um

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,920
he runs their cert team

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,479
uh i treated first aid in

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,320
the manchester terror attack back in

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,680
2017

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,320
and i came fifth overall participating

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,159
on a science etf

33
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,640
against pen testers forensics analysts

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,119
and threat hunters and my team overall

35
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,840
came second

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,520
so just brief briefly about the

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,119
manchester attack

38
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,560
treaty first aid

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,479
i assisted ensuring the safety of the

40
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,759
people who were

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,600
lost managed to get

42
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,040
to where they needed to be

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,840
and to regroup their

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,439
family and got taken to a police car

45
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,079
that's a very fun story that

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,680
yeah

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,759
we should have probably gone

48
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,079
about one to one maybe

49
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,000
and i've got ptsd ptsd insomnia and

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,800
tinnitus from it

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,599
so

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,319
before the actual internship i

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,120
built

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,760
under the supervision of one of my

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,480
now close friends but at the time he was

56
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
a mentorship figure

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,280
who is an apprentice for vodafone

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,560
a

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,319
it's called connect

60
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,680
we built a lab network using psense and

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,840
vmware

62
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,080
exsi on both boxes

63
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,560
the two boxes as you can see in the

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,599
picture although

65
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,239
both connecting to each other one to

66
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,200
firewall for the other

67
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,239
and yes i have been a bb-8 watching to

68
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,920
make sure that they stay functioning

69
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,040
properly

70
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,000
and should any of it go wrong

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
bb is fixing it not me it's on it's on

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,560
him

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
so conor also worked with me while i was

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,760
in

75
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,599
a vodafone and that's an intern

76
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,400
so what is an internship uh so from the

77
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,959
oxford dictionary when i've checked it

78
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,680
it says an internship is a way to gain a

79
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,239
better understanding of practices used

80
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,000
in an industry environment

81
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,280
so some of the takeaways that you could

82
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,080
potentially come from this talk is what

83
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,799
is an internship as i've just said and

84
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,519
what experiences i've had uh

85
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,040
if you ever want to like come have a

86
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,599
talk to me about it great starting point

87
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,200
possibly

88
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,360
how it's potentially helped me

89
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,000
going forward in my life and what you

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,760
could potentially learn from an

91
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,959
internship experience

92
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,920
so about my internship it was with vodka

93
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,640
a the department of cyber prevent which

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,959
and network and telco

95
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,640
so

96
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,879
cyber as a whole is split into two of

97
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,360
what cyber defense and cyber prevent

98
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,159
the

99
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,439
prevent team

100
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,560
are building these ways to prevent

101
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,000
like the security measures we're setting

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,279
up firewalls we're maintaining the

103
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,399
security

104
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,160
meanwhile cyber defense are telling us

105
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,120
how

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,800
badly we're potentially doing

107
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,560
in part because they're the ones working

108
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,440
out

109
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,520
when a threat has actually happened and

110
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,240
took place when an incident has occurred

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,720
what went wrong how to resolve it and

112
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,919
potentially

113
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,280
um

114
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,840
the pen testing team are testing our

115
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,880
systems

116
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,240
so

117
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,680
they're also telling us when we're

118
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,160
messing up

119
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,280
great great sort of environment working

120
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,840
technically as you can see my role was

121
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,600
technology advisor

122
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,960
to vodafone group which i am very proud

123
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,520
of that is just how

124
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,160
think how big vodafone group is

125
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
i just voted for as a whole and i was

126
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,320
their technology advisor so

127
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,960
in that in itself is an achievement

128
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,320
but it really didn't mean anything

129
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,960
besides i wasn't

130
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,400
so i aided in building a million pounds

131
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,880
physical lab in the network which we

132
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,440
then set up to be virtual

133
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,320
with the aim so law any local markets

134
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,680
such as uk

135
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,560
india

136
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
just an m2 germany

137
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,039
they could request a virtual machine

138
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,120
environment we would set that up they

139
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,800
would then test different products in

140
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
that environment

141
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,840
the aim for that lab is to be used

142
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
across departments

143
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
a real i participate in the capture the

144
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,680
flag tournament

145
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,000
and me is one of the best friendships i

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,440
could have possibly asked for to be

147
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,240
honest uh and assisted and coordinated

148
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,840
in a dashboard project

149
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,680
so

150
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,960
as a bit of a visual assistance and

151
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,120
david you can be a lovely assistant here

152
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,440
come on down

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,440
so

154
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,880
to explain how um

155
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,240
in a better way because i know some

156
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,560
people visual learners

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,199
you'll be sorry event so you'll be on

158
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,840
the defense

159
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,759
of on the offense

160
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,400
okay all right

161
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,160
so as

162
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,919
you can see the attack could happen at

163
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,120
any time

164
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,600
um and not only that

165
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,280
but

166
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,120
he had to be prepared for it so the

167
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,160
defenses had to be prepared um

168
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,360
because we don't know how big of a

169
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,800
threat we were potentially facing

170
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,039
thank you

171
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,039
one of the um fun experiences i had

172
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,080
working for vodafone was a trip to path

173
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,639
kerner which is in carmel

174
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,560
it's one of the old cable wireless

175
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,919
centers

176
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,639
it's now been turned into a museum for

177
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,440
about kevin wireless and i was down

178
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,599
there with a

179
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,599
gary um to

180
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,360
essentially help and work with the

181
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,560
museum

182
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,360
of how vodafone could potentially make

183
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
it a bit more future

184
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,599
so we were looking at how

185
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,360
vodafone could implement something to

186
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,599
make it a bit more like up-to-date a bit

187
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,240
more modern per se

188
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,919
while it's still incorporating all of

189
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,319
the traditional stuff and what's already

190
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,319
there so we're bringing it to how the

191
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,560
times are changing

192
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,800
and

193
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,080
yeah

194
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,400
one of the great things and experiences

195
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
i had was actually listening to

196
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
the first time reading of a script about

197
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,759
path kona and cable wireless and history

198
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,759
behind it and how it was a

199
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,680
a area where it was for

200
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,199
the why the people who were setting up

201
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,520
all the wires that got underground

202
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,000
underground and under the water

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,039
so as you can see on the image it is a

204
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,720
map of all the

205
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,599
air cable wireless network

206
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,080
and they

207
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,479
it's how they laid all cables across the

208
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,160
atlantic and connected the different

209
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,039
continents together

210
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,799
so moving on to the projects as i've

211
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,279
briefly covered the lab network

212
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,320
uh so it's a physical network in

213
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,800
the data center which was all the boxes

214
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,959
we then had to make that virtualized so

215
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,399
that way it's easier to access

216
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,399
and it was all for internal testing of

217
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,760
different products

218
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,120
that way we could work out if it

219
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,600
actually is suitable how much it works

220
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,160
and potentially if it fails in the

221
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,600
environment so the environment wasn't

222
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,080
prepared for it or the environment had

223
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,839
something that was a conflict of

224
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,120
interest so we we needed to deal with it

225
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,040
using a lab rather than

226
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,640
in production

227
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
as what's worse than having a whole

228
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,279
system crash in production

229
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,399
so capture the flag um it was a two-day

230
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,680
event

231
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,440
where

232
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,000
a lot well a few a handful of us stayed

233
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,080
up during the night and we

234
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,120
worked together which is frowned upon in

235
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,279
the environment uh

236
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,880
but we worked together

237
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,920
and hinted at ways to get flags

238
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,440
we didn't ever tell each other the

239
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,000
actual flag so there was no flag sharing

240
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,800
but we did help each other learn new

241
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,240
uh aspects i worked with a pen tester

242
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,120
who's very good at what he does and he

243
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,480
showed us how to get quite a few of the

244
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,320
flags i showed him a few of them where

245
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,600
he didn't actually think about just

246
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,279
running the

247
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,399
challenge and puzzle through autopsy

248
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,399
love that tool it will tell you the flag

249
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,480
like if there is a flag easy to find it

250
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,519
will tell you

251
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,640
absolutely

252
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,320
i'm a fan

253
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,839
and it is an open source

254
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,320
tool my team consisted of a penetration

255
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,959
tester an apprentice connor

256
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,120
myself as the intern so we're pretty

257
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,640
handicapped with

258
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,320
a couple of us being

259
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,560
apprentice or an intern but

260
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,000
as of the three of us we've managed to

261
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,120
work through it pretty effectively

262
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,160
uh and we recalled uh

263
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,519
it's not on there

264
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,200
i thought it was there but we were

265
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,360
called um

266
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,959
crush override

267
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,279
from the movie hackers all the tv names

268
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,480
were picked by the event organizers and

269
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,000
i don't think anyone complained about

270
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,279
the team name

271
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,279
i don't think anyone

272
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,720
at least that i'm aware of complained

273
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,480
about any of the names because we're all

274
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,399
a bunch of nerds let's be honest

275
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,279
so one of the projects it was the

276
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,200
dashboard for cert

277
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,839
yes i'm aware that's fireeye project

278
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,560
dashboard and

279
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,800
not a vodafone one that's purely because

280
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,920
it didn't pan out as what we expected

281
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,560
and we've had to i believe it's been

282
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,800
adapted for a different project

283
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,680
which is ongoing and i wasn't part of so

284
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,839
i wasn't sure somebody else's work and

285
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:32,720
said

286
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,640
i worked on it when i haven't

287
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,440
uh but we did regular meetings which

288
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,600
helped the team greatly

289
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,760
uh quite often the

290
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
meetings were literally just a

291
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,399
quick rundown of either what we're doing

292
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,279
and then

293
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,480
the rest of the time we were just

294
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
talking about casual stuff that every

295
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,240
day-to-day life

296
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,880
and it was a way to unwind

297
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,639
sort of thing but then we were still

298
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,000
making sure we were covering what we

299
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
needed to do

300
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,040
uh

301
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,120
the trial proved to be extremely

302
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,639
successful in the development of the

303
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,040
tool i believe that's right

304
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,560
yeah

305
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,040
and yes i was

306
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
helping with this project follow cyber

307
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,279
defense uh for

308
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,360
the manager of cert which is over there

309
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,560
gary hoskin

310
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,360
um that is his linkedin should any of us

311
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,560
try and look him up and stuff

312
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,200
so yeah the dashboard project used to go

313
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,639
briefly over it

314
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,320
i was the project coordinator i was

315
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,839
helping to make sure we tried to match

316
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,880
the deadlines and we matched what

317
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,720
what workers required

318
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
i was assigned that role purely because

319
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,360
at dinner table i could easily spin my

320
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,040
chair around have a conversation with

321
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,560
the manager

322
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,839
and often be told if i wanted to

323
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,480
continue uh

324
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,920
eating the food that i was having and

325
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,399
not have it thrown at me i

326
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,920
should really just be quiet at times

327
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,440
we learned that we needed an sql

328
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,760
database to do what we wanted to do

329
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,959
we learned we needed api keys and

330
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,480
a better understanding of what the

331
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,399
targets were

332
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,560
the problems we had were team members

333
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,680
changing

334
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,360
uh roles so one team member left

335
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,560
halfway through the

336
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,480
towards the end of the project um and

337
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,800
because it was an instant response team

338
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,200
we had the issue of they had incidents

339
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,680
to deal with rather than

340
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,638
a small dashboard project

341
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,800
how this has helped me uh

342
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,320
although i'm only in first year it's

343
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,000
helped me start come up with potential

344
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,920
ideas for my dissertation

345
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,199
uh

346
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,320
and

347
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,920
i believe everyone will agree you've got

348
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,760
to start sooner thinking about that

349
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,000
rather than too late because a lot of

350
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,240
people stress about it

351
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,000
it helped me with the first semester

352
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,920
with a research coursework project we

353
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,720
had

354
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,120
where i just wrote about

355
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,800
the dashboard project a bit of what it's

356
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,959
then expanded into

357
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,560
it's helped me make new friends with the

358
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,000
within the industry

359
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and learn tools such as power bi power

360
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,120
automatic pf sets uh firewalls

361
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,199
love them they are my favorite firewalls

362
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,439
to go for

363
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,839
yeah it's helped me with coursework so

364
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,600
potential ideas that i could use is the

365
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,399
dashboard tooling system a lab network

366
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,839
and how it can be built and improved

367
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,959
upon

368
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,120
uh other tools that are used in

369
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,639
businesses

370
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,399
obviously i would need to get a group

371
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,480
like an agreement with my former manager

372
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,720
about it

373
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,399
if i was to potentially go down other

374
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,360
tools within the business

375
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,959
tools that i've learned from it is

376
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,360
autopsy as i've covered and how much i

377
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,240
love autopsy fdk imager

378
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,880
um so during the ctf that was one that i

379
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,720
heavily had to use

380
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,880
uh pf center firewall it's open source

381
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,720
it's a very nice solution

382
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,079
esxi asxi

383
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,320
clusters and boxes

384
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,720
it's a nice way to get virtual machines

385
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,560
and troubleshooting done right is one of

386
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,120
my friends will call it

387
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,440
so you look at the osi layer and you

388
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
work out which way around is it is it

389
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,120
actually the end user potentially having

390
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,440
the problem and then you that's looking

391
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,120
physical but then you work your way

392
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
through to work out where's the actual

393
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,440
fault

394
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,440
friendships

395
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,920
obviously xbox gamer chats uh people to

396
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,399
vent anger and frustration to they use

397
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,800
it against me too uh people have bounced

398
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,000
ideas off

399
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,959
and

400
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,160
people who could

401
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,759
further assist my

402
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,560
understanding and knowledge

403
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,839
so what you could learn

404
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,160
depending on the role of team it really

405
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,800
is

406
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
as the team could potentially not be

407
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
fully established it could also

408
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,680
be

409
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,079
or could be fully established and you're

410
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,160
coming in as an outsider so you need to

411
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,079
find a way to get into the group and

412
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,639
into the fall to then be able to work

413
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,560
best on it

414
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,480
so for me i believe that the best

415
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,320
internships require an understanding of

416
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,720
where you want to be so i knew going

417
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,480
into it i was wanting to be either an

418
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,199
instant responder or a pen tester

419
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,360
i left it not sure which of the two

420
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,680
areas but i had a better understanding

421
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,720
of the two

422
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,120
different departments and teams

423
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,440
a mentor who believes in you uh connor

424
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,040
was one of the best mentors i've had he

425
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,800
always whenever a day or night he would

426
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,160
message he would make sure i was all

427
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,560
right he'd also make sure that i knew

428
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,079
what i was doing when i was assigned to

429
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,240
work if i ever struggled i could message

430
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,680
him

431
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,480
my manager stuart um he trusted me to

432
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,560
just get on with the work and whenever i

433
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,240
was having a problem or needed a bit

434
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,279
more help

435
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,199
i could call out and he was there

436
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,120
willing to support he would also help

437

the team get the team involved and get

438
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,000
