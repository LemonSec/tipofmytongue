1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,560
you you got into that one thing you

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,000
really care about you know being a job

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,279
interview

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,920
a university application or maybe

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,360
a competition raise your hand

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,599
and how many of you

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,840
have felt that joy and relief when you

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,600
knew you were going to that unknown new

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,880
place in your life

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,599
last summer

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,599
i felt that excitement

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,679
i had the opportunity to go to one of

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,279
the biggest hiking competitions in the

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,159
world

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,760
the opportunity to experience something

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,719
new

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,239
exciting

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,800
unknown

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,040
the journey to qualifying was filled

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,719
with uncertainty but quickly became one

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,200
of my most treasured experiences filled

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
it with inspiring people

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,039
challenging problems and unforgettable

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,520
memories

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,440
and today

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,039
i want to make you a part of this

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,280
journey and showcase the cool things

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,960
that you can do with your knack for

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
cyber

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,120
my name is victor i am a mathematics

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,159
student here at the university of

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,438
edinburgh

33
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,600
but more often than not i do find myself

34
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,040
you know reverse engineering quite a lot

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
of different things speed malware beat

36
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,799
firmware anything that i can get my

37
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,920
hands on and that naturally segues into

38
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,479
me being into ctfs

39
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,400
in fact i'm so into ctfs that i will

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,680
probably not be sleeping tonight

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,600
so just to make sure

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,520
is there anyone here who doesn't know

43
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,880
what a capture to fly contest is

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,640
all right phenomenal we seem to be on

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,240
the same page

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,759
and this is precisely what my talk is

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,720
about

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
in fact it is about a very particular

49
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,240
ctf

50
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,680
defcon

51
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,759
one of the biggest hacker conferences in

52
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,240
the world also happens to run one of the

53
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,840
biggest hacking competitions in the

54
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,640
world

55
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,960
and each four years it is organized by a

56
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,720
different team of people

57
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,399
in our year it was organized by the

58
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,200
order of the overflow or ooo for short

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,360
and you know this is where the big teams

60
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,119
want to get their hands dirty they want

61
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,719
to have fun they want to hack and then

62
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,360
they want to get drunk in the end

63
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,759
so i will take you through my journey of

64
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,318
qualifying preparing for and playing in

65
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,680
the finals

66
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,520
look at some interesting challenges and

67
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,080
some crazy experiences and by the end of

68
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,840
this talk you'll have gained an insight

69
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,400
in how insane and amazing playing ctf's

70
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,959
of this scale is what cool things you

71
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,480
could be doing and sacrificing your

72
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,000
sleep for

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,480
and you know how you can use experiences

74
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,720
like this to form new connections

75
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,319
and learn in a very fast-paced

76
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,239
environment

77
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,200
so naturally for a big ctf like this uh

78
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,440
you need a big and good team and this is

79
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,720
us

80
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,560
it's organizers

81
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
so organizers came to be in 2020.

82
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,360
effectively we some of us had this idea

83
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
that you know we want to play in defcon

84
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,400
ctf

85
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,319
but we're kind of too small of a team to

86
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,640
to to make a big difference

87
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,879
so we decided to reach out to our people

88
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,280
uh we asked others like you know do you

89
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,720
have any ctf teams that you're playing

90
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,560
with and could we collaborate and so

91
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,200
that's what we did uh we took a couple

92
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,760
people uh from the uk like crown uh we

93
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,680
took a research initiative called secret

94
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,920
club and a couple university teams from

95
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,480
switzerland called polyglots and flagbot

96
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
we threw them all together into one big

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,760
discord server and we started playing

98
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,800
defcon you know eventually we realized

99
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,640
you know we really like each other so

100
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,400
let's just continue playing cts from now

101
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,200
on

102
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,720
we came up with a name we called

103
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,360
ourselves the organizers we got our logo

104
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,840
and we were ready to

105
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,480
roll unfortunately in 2020 we did not

106
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,040
qualify for defcon ctf

107
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,519
well [ __ ] we thought there's always next

108
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,159
year and so our challenge number one

109
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,040
was to qualify for defcon ctf finals in

110
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,720
2021

111
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,560
you may be wondering how the hell do you

112
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,640
qualify for defcon finals

113
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,879
and there are usually two ways each year

114
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,599
the organizing committee will pick out

115
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,920
you know three or four ctfs hosted by

116
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,640
other teams that will be pre-qualifier

117
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,319
events so if you happen to get first

118
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,080
place in those you automatically get a

119
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,599
spot in the finals

120
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,760
the other way is to play in the official

121
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,519
qualifier event

122
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,319
now unfortunately for us

123
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,840
we got beaten in all the four

124
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,238
pre-qualifier events so our last hope

125
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,839
was to play in the defcon ctf qualifiers

126
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,680
and what it actually means for us is

127
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,000
this

128
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,320
so yeah it was time for another 40 48

129
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,960
straight hours of ctf-ing um

130
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
the style was geoparty so there were

131
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,080
just a bunch of challenges that you

132
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,280
could download

133
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,759
uh you do the task you submit some piece

134
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,240
of text for points and your honorable so

135
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,120
it kicked off there was many challenges

136
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,800
high difficulty

137
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,680
um

138
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,199
but there was really one challenge that

139
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,040
made all the difference

140
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,360
it was a special challenge

141
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,680
and it was about getting into this door

142
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,479
now

143
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,680
the challenge was simple there were

144
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,040
multiple levels

145
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,080
and throughout the map there were

146
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,919
scattered some levers you know like in

147
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,080
minecraft and all you had to do was to

148
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
pull a couple of them in order for that

149
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,039
door to open

150
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,600
but of course we're hackers

151
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
we like video games precisely because we

152
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,800
can hack them so our first idea is

153
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,880
can we solve the challenge

154
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,560
without actually solving the challenge

155
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,600
the answer is no

156
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
our wonderful plan failed

157
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,199
and we had to resort to the intended

158
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,400
solution

159
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,160
and i would like to demonstrate to you

160
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,240
our very favorite video which really

161
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,199
tells you

162
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,160
what this challenge looks like

163
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,939
[Music]

164
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,039
um

165
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,109
[Music]

166
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,709
[Music]

167
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,060
[Music]

168
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,479
foreign

169
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,639
a lot of the time when we were pulling

170
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,199
these levers uh we really felt like

171
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,680
cronk from that disney movie

172
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
uh and more often than not this was the

173
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,560
end result

174
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,319
however i think the challenge was quite

175
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,960
interesting um it was quite a lot of fun

176
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,440
first of all figuring out what levers to

177
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,840
pull and realizing that they are all

178
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,000
logic gates you know figuring out that

179
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,759
they're all nested logic gates and

180
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,319
figuring out all the logic for them um

181
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,000
was quite the challenge so i think we

182
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,400
had like 15 plus people in disc in a

183
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,160
discord call at one point shouting at

184
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,400
each other someone was writing a script

185
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,120
and it was total chaos

186
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,879
but in the end we got closer to the

187
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,319
solution we got a script that

188
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,160
automatically solved everything for us

189
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,919
um we got the points and we could

190
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,039
finally move on

191
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,720
after that challenge the qualifiers were

192
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,160
coming closer to an end and you know we

193
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,639
were getting worried because we're up

194
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,479
there on the leaderboard somewhere

195
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,840
but we weren't really

196
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,559
sure whether we would actually qualify

197
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,120
um and so a lot of people started like

198
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,958
screaming all the way around this chord

199
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,399
and being like guys we need one more

200
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,360
flag

201
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,640
carl was poking someone

202
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,599
and you know there was a lot of

203
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,360
uncertainty on the table

204
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,000
you know did we qualify

205
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,120
did we

206
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,800
um

207
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,600
in the end we came 13.

208
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,160
now a tweet came out telling us that the

209
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
top 16 teams from all the qualifying

210
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,959
events uh will go to the finals now

211
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,279
we'll we are 13th and there are four

212
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,040
pre-qualifier events which means that

213
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,839
we're in fact top

214
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,399
17. we omitted one single detail however

215
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,000
and it was the fact that one of the

216
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,240
teams happened to play two different

217
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,880
qualifiers under a different name

218
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,920
which bumps us to one place up

219
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,880
and we suddenly get this message

220
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,760
congratulations you are in defcon ctf

221
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,040
finals

222
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,720
now i do not expect you to read any of

223
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,200
this text but there is a very

224
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,760
crucial piece of information here um

225
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
which says that travel

226
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,880
travel is going to be crazier than ever

227
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,920
and that is a [ __ ] understatement

228
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,600
uh

229
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,480
so you know we collect our team

230
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,120
um but before we we can actually talk

231
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,720
about travel we need to make one more

232
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,240
important decision

233
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,480
and that is challenge number two

234
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,320
we have to come up with a funny team

235
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,680
name

236
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,120
so you know we start kind of looking at

237
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,200
the meme potential here we start looking

238
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,040
at what the organizers are called and

239
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,079
they go by ooo

240
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,680
now the thing is we go by organizers

241
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,920
if you combine them together

242
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,760
we're now oo organizers

243
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,920
and this was quite an interesting name

244
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,760
because it in fact started an internal

245
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,839
discussion in the organizing committee

246
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,440
uh whether they would actually permit us

247
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,120
to use this or not

248
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,800
because they weren't sure whether other

249
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,959
teams would associate us with them

250
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,320
making them think that they were playing

251
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,399
their own challenges

252
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,160
so we were causing lots of trouble even

253
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,320
before the finals started

254
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,800
and that was a good one

255
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,480
so we were very honored that you know

256
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,800
our humor was respected and luckily they

257
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,560
did let us have the name in the end um

258
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,480
so we were good to go and we could

259
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,320
finally move on to challenge three and

260
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,519
that is figuring out travel

261
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,320
now

262
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,000
you know we're a massive team we want to

263
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,320
see each other uh and we had this little

264
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,279
blob

265
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,120
be in our way

266
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,240
so we don't know what to do

267
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,760
you know we want to go to las vegas to

268
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,600
the us to be there in person for the

269
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,760
finals we can't really do that because

270
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
the u.s is locked off

271
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,000
so it's brainstorming time and a couple

272
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,680
of ideas are thrown around one of them

273
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,440
is let's just play online no one wants

274
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,720
to do that

275
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,800
another idea was to go to mexico for two

276
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,160
weeks because apparently if you do that

277
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,000
you could get into the us

278
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,920
then again you know some of us have jobs

279
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,760
in university and things like that so we

280
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,160
can't really go to mexico and spend two

281
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,360
weeks there before we go to defcon

282
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,200
but we could just plain in mainland

283
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,079
europe and that's what we did we decided

284
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,160
that switzerland was the place to go we

285
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,839
were going to go to lausanne we're going

286
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,279
to play at one of the universities there

287
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,360
they were kind enough to offer us some

288
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,640
room

289
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,880
a space for us to play

290
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,040
and that was the decision that was made

291
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,279
however you know uh we're a fun bunch of

292
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,399
people

293
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,560
and naturally we have a couple people

294
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,639
that really don't like giving up

295
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,720
so they start googling a couple things

296
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,320
and they find out

297
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,680
that you can get something called a

298
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,079
national interest exemption which means

299
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,440
if you're of the national interest of

300
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,959
the us government

301
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,959
you can skip all the covet rules and you

302
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,200
can go to las vegas

303
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
now you know we're going to a conference

304
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,279
so expecting nothing half of our team

305
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,959
from switzerland actually applied for an

306
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,279
exemption

307
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,440
um

308
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,920
you know we don't expect anything and by

309
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,440
me saying this you already know what's

310
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,800
going to happen

311
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,680
o organizers are supposedly of national

312
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,040
interest to the us government

313
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,360
we got this message in discord

314
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,279
saying that we got exemptions and so

315
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,639
half of our team could actually travel

316
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,000
to defcon

317
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,519
that's crazy

318
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,399
um so as we do we found our way around

319
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,880
the rules again

320
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,959
and eventually you know some of us

321
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,880
decided like okay half of us are staying

322
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,320
in switzerland half of us are going to

323
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,200
stay

324
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,959
in in las vegas and that's the decision

325
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,720
that was made

326
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,040
now we end up going to lausanne

327
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,560
we end up enjoying our time there you

328
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,920
know relaxing preparing for the

329
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,000
competition and all and while that's

330
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,120
happening

331
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,800
a couple of our friends are on a plane

332
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,200
going to the us

333
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,519
and nothing sucks more on the plane than

334
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,760
not having wi-fi right we all know this

335
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
feeling when you connected our wi-fi and

336
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,839
it tells you to

337
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,279
pay so we were like well they're not

338
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,720
going to pay for that

339
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,320
so we wouldn't expect them to you know

340
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
send us any messages

341
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,760
whilst we're kind of relaxing in

342
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,120
switzerland

343
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,720
to our surprise

344
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,880
suddenly we get a photo from one of the

345
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,959
people on the plane

346
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,680
showcasing his new nap network called

347
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,199
flab god

348
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,519
um and we're like well what's this about

349
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,120
um and the conversation proceeds

350
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,600
something like this

351
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,240
alright and let me tell you my dear ltdh

352
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
participants uh today i will actually

353
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,760
show you how to hack airplane wi-fi

354
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,440
using google cloud

355
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,360
uh so

356
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,000
someone found out that on the plane if

357
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,839
you connected a wi-fi even without

358
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,199
paying

359
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,760
a lot of google ips are whitelisted for

360
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,199
some reason

361
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,480
and so apparently you can connect to any

362
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,079
google service

363
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,720
from any google ip

364
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,320
so their thought process is well if we

365
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,079
can do that then we can connect to

366
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,600
google cloud

367
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,480
we can spin up a google cloud vm

368
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,120
and we can create a proxy

369
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,959
and that's effectively what happened you

370
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,040
know while we're relaxing in switzerland

371
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,040
our people going to the us before even

372
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,880
entering the us are already [ __ ] [ __ ]

373
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,560
up so you know the competition is going

374
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,880
to be good

375
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,680
eventually we all land uh we all are in

376
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,519
our two separate places

377
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,199
and everyone gets to relax prepare a

378
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,959
little bit for the competition and we

379
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,639
have to you know um start thinking a

380
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,920
little bit about

381
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,720
uh

382
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,560
preparing for it

383
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,240
now the finals are different to the

384
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,560
qualifiers in the sense that the types

385
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,880
of challenges you meet are are not

386
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,480
geoparty anymore

387
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,920
in fact for the finals we had two

388
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,199
different styles

389
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,519
there was attack defense and king of the

390
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,720
hill

391
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,519
now an attack defense ctf effectively

392
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,440
works like this you have a bunch of

393
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,639
servers each of which is owned by each

394
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,079
particular team that is participating in

395
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,120
the finals

396
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,279
now each server has the very same

397
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,959
services running on it

398
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,959
a lot of which have exploits in them

399
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,320
your task is to find the bugs

400
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,639
exploit everyone else and patch them on

401
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,199
your end

402
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,880
and that sounds pretty cool and in fact

403
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,800
the challenges can get quite crazy uh

404
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,079
there's actually a lot of strategical

405
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,880
thinking involved uh for example in in

406
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,600
the case of this this particular ctf

407
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,680
there were two ways to submit exploits

408
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,839
there was a hidden channel where nobody

409
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,600
else can see the traffic and if you

410
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,279
successfully exploited someone you got

411
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,199
half of the points

412
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,360
then there's the main channel where

413
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,440
everyone can see your traffic they can

414
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,040
see what you're doing

415
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,800
but you get full points

416
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,399
and so you have to make real-time

417
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,680
decisions

418
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,079
about which channel to use

419
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:16,880
when

420
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,800
you know is a team ahead of you you know

421
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,160
are they exploiting using the same

422
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,120
exploit um how far ahead is the other

423
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,560
team with this exploit et cetera et

424
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,000
cetera so you have to like make

425
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,440
strategic decisions about uh what you do

426
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,120
at each kind of tick of the servers

427
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,480
and you know a central strategy for our

428
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,680
ctf uh was that when we had our server

429
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,519
out there somewhere

430
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,399
we were quite bad at exploiting people

431
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,000
uh we we couldn't figure out the

432
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,240
exploits as much but fortunately for us

433
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,600
a lot of the people did use the main

434
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,720
channel

435
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,880
so one strategical thing to do was to

436
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,959
analyze the traffic

437
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,360
and you know steal the exploit try to

438
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,519
patch it and then just reroute the

439
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,000
exploit the other way around

440
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,440
so a lot of our time was spent on

441
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,240
something like this

442
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,000
we were just taking other people's

443
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,760
exploits and it actually gained us quite

444
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,919
a lot of points

445
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,119
um

446
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,880
now the second style of challenges that

447
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,119
we had was of course king of the hill

448
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,559
and king of the hill was a fun one

449
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,000
because it's very different to attack

450
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,199
defense

451
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,319
all you have to do is to solve a task by

452
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,640
providing the best solution

453
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
so what is the best solution well

454
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,400
depending on what you're doing for

455
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,080
example if you have a shell coding

456
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,160
challenge your solution is better than

457
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,400
someone else's if your shell code is

458
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,039
shorter so as long as you spin shorter

459
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,640
shellcode than a different team you know

460
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,080
you're the king of the hill you're

461
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,919
getting the most points

462
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,640
and that's kind of how it works

463
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,640
now

464
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,559
we kind of prepare for it we write a lot

465
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,559
of scripts uh we have like different

466
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,200
traffic analyzers all over the place um

467
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,640
we're ready

468
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,799
and so the countdown starts

469
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,080
you know we are sitting there we're

470
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,160
ready for the finals

471
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,600
five

472
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,280
four

473
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,799
three

474
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,799
two

475
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,799
one

476
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,559
captain's meeting

477
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,720
apparently the ctf doesn't start

478
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,320
uh because the infrastructure is looking

479
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,160
something like this

480
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,840
um so

481
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,720
we get on a captain's call um

482
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
and and we're told by one of the

483
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,720
organizers

484
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
effectively something along those lines

485
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,880
everything's [ __ ] the infrastructure

486
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,919
is down

487
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,520
this discord call is happening from a

488
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,760
tethered connection on my phone

489
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,799
good start to a good ctf now to top it

490
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,280
all off some of the challenges actually

491
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
got leaked beforehand

492
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,640
uh so

493
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,480
we could spend our time you know reverse

494
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,840
engineering them and finding all the

495
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,799
bugs

496
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,240
uh but then they told us that there is

497
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,600
no guarantee that those challenges will

498
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,360
actually be released maybe they would

499
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,200
maybe they wouldn't so it was up to us

500
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
whether we want to spend time on it or

501
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,160
not

502
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,039
so the start was great um

503
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,640
but you know not all of the challenges

504
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
were leaked and in the end a lot of them

505
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
are quite a lot of fun

506
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,160
the first one i would like to talk about

507
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,240
was the king of the hill style

508
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,000
challenge that was called show your

509
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,440
shell

510
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,880
it was quite simple

511
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,320
all you had to do was to submit

512
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,520
shellcode

513
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
that read out the file which had some

514
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,280
sort of secret in it and if you did that

515
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,840
successfully you gained points

516
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,360
but there was a catch there were a

517
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,280
couple rules to what your shell could

518
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,480
could do

519
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,640
first of all you had a set of blocked

520
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,240
bytes

521
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,919
if your shellcode used any of these

522
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,960
bytes it would not be accepted

523
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,880
so you had to kind of think about okay

524
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,320
so we have to craft shell code without

525
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,679
using any of these bytes in the block

526
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,039
list

527
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,200
now in order for your shellcode to

528
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,760
actually pass some other checks

529
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,120
if you had another team who had their

530
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,480
shell code out there they were the king

531
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,600
of the hill

532
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,200
then in order for your shellcode to be

533
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,640
accepted either

534
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,200
you had to provide a shellcode that used

535
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,120
less unique bytes than that team for

536
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,159
example if that team happened to use

537
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,400
ford ox4244 and 59

538
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,559
if you use oxab and ff

539
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,240
uh then you're you know you have less

540
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,320
unique bytes your shell code is accepted

541
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,640
alternatively as long as you use one

542
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,720
byte um that is different to what

543
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,880
everyone else is using you also pass the

544
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,400
check

545
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,760
so now you know if your shellcode passed

546
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,520
you were added to the king of the hill

547
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,440
uh you were gaining points

548
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,679
and any bytes that the previous team

549
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,080
used but you didn't use was now added to

550
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,280
the blocked list

551
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,120
as you can imagine it gets quite crazy

552
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,480
because the block list just starts

553
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,919
growing really really fast

554
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,320
and you can you know it piles up and to

555
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,559
top it all off

556
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,760
you could use three different

557
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,440
architectures

558
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,000
so as long as your shell code run on one

559
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,520
of these three

560
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,960
you are good to go

561
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,880
so not only do you have to worry about

562
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,799
what bytes to use but you also have to

563
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,320
make an active decision what

564
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,000
architecture is the most reasonable to

565
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
use depending on what bytes you have

566
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,360
available

567
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,880
and you know we're they're geared up

568
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,039
we're quite happy we're getting out our

569
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,120
like super cool eight unique byte shell

570
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,559
code out there

571
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,000
but of course

572
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,080
there's that one team

573
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,760
it's that one team that does things

574
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,480
differently and they decide to use three

575
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,640
unique bytes

576
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,559
to craft a shell code

577
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,320
that is a rock chain

578
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,840
and all it does

579
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,000
it adds a couple numbers

580
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,080
it pushes them to the stack which is an

581
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,480
address and it returns to it so it keeps

582
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,720
jumping to different addresses until it

583
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,840
magically somehow prints out the secrets

584
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,159
so we're just like

585
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,039
wow

586
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,039
you know that's crazy i've never thought

587
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:43,840
of

588
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,000
making a shell code using three unique

589
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,720
bytes that would do that kind of thing

590
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,320
and of course we had to make a meme for

591
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,080
it

592
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,159
so we wanted to write some really cool

593
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,240
you know constraint based encoder

594
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,480
develop a really cool strategy and then

595
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,919
there was tea deliverers who were just

596
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:00,960
like now we're just going to use three

597
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
bites like go [ __ ] yourself

598
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,320
um

599
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,799
to top it all off um when we were

600
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,520
writing some of our shell codes uh

601
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,320
it wasn't working for some reason until

602
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,760
someone realized

603
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,880
that they were cutting the wrong file

604
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,000
and so we were off to a good start

605
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
we were all hyped up and you know it was

606
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,159
a lot of fun we were having fun with it

607
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,840
maybe it wasn't going necessarily our

608
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,799
way

609
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,600
but it was really funny

610
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,840
but in the end you know even though we

611
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,120
didn't necessarily do well in the

612
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,720
challenge it was still very educational

613
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,840
because

614
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,880
i don't know how many of you have

615
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,799
actually thought of making a rock chain

616
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,559
using three unique bytes because i sure

617
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,600
have it

618
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,200
and to top it all off you know when you

619
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,679
read all these write-ups online people

620
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,679
started using some some pretty crazy

621
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,480
mathematics in order to deduce

622
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,400
what bytes were the most reasonable ones

623
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,200
to use and how you wanted to kind of

624
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,039
map them together in order to construct

625
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,280
something that works

626
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
so you start thinking about problems in

627
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,200
a completely different way you're really

628
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,880
thinking outside of the box and it's

629
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,799
quite amazing

630
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,799
but of course it doesn't stop there

631
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,640
there are more challenges

632
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,159
and i have to ask

633
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,240
how many of you have played the game

634
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,039
baba is you

635
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,080
well we have one contestant here a

636
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,559
couple others in the back of the room

637
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,880
simply speaking baba's you is a puzzle

638
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,840
game you play as this white blob

639
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,120
and all you have to do is move some

640
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,200
blocks around for example if it says

641
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,640
wall is stop

642
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,640
if you move the stop block away from it

643
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,240
the wall is no longer stopping you from

644
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,919
crossing it

645
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,120
and it gets a little bit more

646
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,799
complicated than that you effectively

647
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,640
solve a lot of different puzzles

648
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,120
now the organizers were like nah [ __ ]

649
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,520
that let's just put shellcode into it

650
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
and so i present to you

651
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,840
zero is you

652
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
a baba isu based challenge where you

653
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,600
place a zero

654
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,679
you have to move a couple blocks and

655
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,840
your task is to execute and pop a shell

656
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,559
um so

657
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,080
multiple architectures are involved

658
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,919
again you can actually you move some

659
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,760
blocks around and you can switch between

660
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,400
x86 between spark between mips and it

661
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,000
gets really crazy

662
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
so we spent a lot of time in fact just

663
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
playing the game manually because we

664
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,400
weren't quite sure what to do

665
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,240
i wrote a python module

666
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,960
that

667
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,520
did some disassembly to help our our

668
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,840
teammates kind of debug some things etc

669
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,520
etc

670
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
but apart from that light side of

671
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,480
scripting we kind of just went by hand

672
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,000
and of course there was that one crazy

673
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,240
team that managed to somehow solve 14

674
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,919
out of 15 levels before the contest

675
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,559
ended we got as far as level eight so

676
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,720
we're not sure how they did it uh but

677
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,880
supposedly it's possible

678
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,880
um and if you want to play this it's

679
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,640
available online so if you want to do

680
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,559
some shell coding in baba is you style

681
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,440
it's out there for you

682
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,799
now

683
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,559
the most important thing

684
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,200
that we had happening is also that

685
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,720
you know we're in two different time

686
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,799
zones some people are in switzerland

687
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,559
or some people are in the u.s

688
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,559
and that means that some of us are

689
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,559
sitting there at 4 00 a.m

690
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,320
really really tired

691
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,600
of doing all these shell coding

692
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,279
challenges

693
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,679
so what do you do you're tired you have

694
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,200
no motivation

695
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,520
well you start making memes

696
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,080
so every day at 4 00 am we started a

697
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,400
meme production facility

698
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,880
and you know at some point we really

699
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
started losing our sanity so

700
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,919
there was a couple memes

701
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,559
like this one

702
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,640
uh of course we had a meme

703
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,279
about the leaked challenges

704
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,799
then get the exploits and all this

705
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,480
replication and stealing of exploits of

706
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,760
course that also deserve the meme

707
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,440
so at this point we're really really

708
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,360
tired and we had some people just

709
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,039
screaming things around on the on the

710
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,880
university floor uh you know we had

711
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,840
things going on like this

712
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,240
it was really not time to watch the

713
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,360
levers

714
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,120
the levers were left for the qualifiers

715
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,239
we really needed points

716
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
and so that really brings us to the fact

717
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,039
that every day we also tried to solve

718
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,039
some attack and defense challenges and

719
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,000
those were quite crazy as well

720
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,039
but boy were they really really hard

721
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,760
um all of them went under the name of

722
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,919
ooows

723
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,919
and basically it was just a bunched up

724
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,600
of different services

725
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,279
all had their own bugs

726
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,159
um

727
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,559
and a lot of them were virtualized so

728
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,640
anything from hypervisors to custom

729
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,679
architectures it was all there

730
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,799
uh we again lost our sanity uh with carl

731
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,120
being like yeah this is really backdoors

732
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,360
um and then backing up on that statement

733
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,720
and saying that no in fact it's not

734
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,799
really backdoored

735
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,120
some of them had very unfortunate naming

736
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,440
and briefly speaking

737
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,960
they were really cool challenges in the

738
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,520
end you know this challenge um was a

739
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,520
re-implementation of an ixp 1200 network

740
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,480
processor so someone went out you know

741
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,279
back in time found some random processor

742
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,320
and they were like yeah i'm going to

743
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
make a challenge about that so you're

744
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,240
really you know going into this crazy

745
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,799
stuff that you've never ever seen before

746
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,640
and we spent hours and hours on end

747
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,559
trying to figure out what was going on

748
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,120
until i eventually found out that

749
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,559
you know there's a custom instruction

750
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,559
set going on in here this is just some

751
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,360
sort of processor that is virtualized um

752
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,799
and so we had a couple of our friends

753
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,240
you know work on it

754
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,600
together with me

755
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,840
and i think the biggest hit was taken by

756
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,919
leo who looked like this by the end of

757
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,080
it all

758
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,360
so what you really take away from these

759
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,600
challenges is that they're really damn

760
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,840
hard but they're also very educational

761
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,159
you're really thrown into the deep end

762
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,919
of cyber security you're looking at

763
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,840
things you've never looked at before and

764
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,159
you really try and start making you know

765
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,080
try to make sense of things try to

766
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,320
reverse engineer them you know

767
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,159
a lot of my skills were put to use i

768
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,919
learned a lot on the way

769
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,520
uh in a lot of the challenges you also

770
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,320
had to utilize you know search engines

771
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,520
you didn't know what you're looking at

772
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,200
so you start googling it

773
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,720
um

774
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,039
and sometimes that led you to some blog

775
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,279
posts about hypervisors and how to make

776
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,600
them from scratch so all of a sudden you

777
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,039
knew how to make a hypervisor from

778
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,720
scratch and you had to try and apply

779
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,480
that knowledge to solve a particular

780
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,600
challenge that was at the ctf

781
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,679
and you know we

782
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,679
just learned so much from from doing all

783
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,960
these challenges

784
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,039
and eventually the ctf came to an end

785
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,720
but the adventure

786
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,960
was not over yet

787
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,640
we decided that we're going to go on a

788
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,559
team call because we wanted to see each

789
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,320
other you know we wanted to chat about

790
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,960
what happened how we performed we in the

791
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,039
end we got 10th place out of 16 teams

792
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,320
which was great

793
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,279
we

794
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,880
didn't expect a lot because we've never

795
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,039
played in the finals but for us this was

796
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,000
a great experience it was fantastic

797
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,559
and of course on the call after the

798
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,919
airplane hack

799
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,919
after getting national interest

800
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,320
exemptions you know that the u.s people

801
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,679
had one more card under their sleeve

802
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,440
and that was their internet setup at the

803
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,640
hotel

804
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,880
so to give a little bit of background

805
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,600
people um there were a maximum of eight

806
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,440
people that could go to the defcon ctf

807
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,279
floor to actually play the ctf so most

808
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,279
of them still stayed in like the suite

809
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,279
that they rented at a hotel

810
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,520
unfortunately for them the internet at

811
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,760
the hotel was terrible

812
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,080
so they came up with an alternative

813
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,120
solution

814
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,600
and it looked something like this

815
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,360
it had a router

816
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,440
that was connected to some switch in a

817
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,520
random spot on the floor

818
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,120
and there was some cable management

819
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,240
going on

820
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,480
for some reason and went all the way to

821
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,320
the bathroom

822
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,240
where there was another switch

823
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,480
that then happened to be connected to a

824
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,520
phone

825
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
and what the hell do you think phones

826
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,440
have to do with this all well the

827
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,520
internet is bad they found out that

828
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,720
tethering your connection through like

829
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,919
4g

830
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,760
was much better than what the int like

831
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,320
the the hotel had to offer

832
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,799
but the signal was very bad

833
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,320
unless you were in the bathroom

834
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,399
so you place your phone on a wireless

835
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,399
charger in the bathroom

836
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,640
you let it sit there you connect it to a

837
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,799
to a couple switches to a couple routers

838
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,880
and suddenly you've got semi-decent

839
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,840
wi-fi

840
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,120
so the ctf ends

841
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,080
we eventually all return to zurich

842
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,559
you know we meet up we chat we have fun

843
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,360
we process what happened

844
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,000
and the takeaways are really that ctfs

845
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,760
are really exciting they're really fun

846
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,000
they're amazing experiences you never

847
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,679
know what you're gonna get

848
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,440
you know i never expected that we were

849
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,279
gonna

850
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,799
be of national interest to the u.s

851
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,640
government uh i never expected someone

852
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,799
to hack the airplane wi-fi

853
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,480
and neither did i expect the terrible

854
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,919
cable management that we just saw in the

855
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,600
video out there

856
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,320
um and they're also very educational you

857
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,960
know you're thrown into such a deep end

858
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,320
looking at things you've never seen

859
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
before and of course the challenges are

860
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,200
fun

861
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,720
at some point you're playing a video

862
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,799
game and pulling levers but in fact it's

863
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,399
all logic gates and you can you know

864
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,480
take it out to the abstract you can

865
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
start thinking outside of the box and

866
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,080
you can start solving these challenges

867
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,519
in new ways that you've never thought of

868
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,960
before

869
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,559
and you start learning so many things

870
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,159
you know going out to blog posts it

871
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,799
really forces you to embrace all the

872
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,600
information that's out there

873
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,840
and i think the most valuable thing of

874
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,600
them all is that they're friendship

875
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,880
forming

876
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,640
you get a bunch of people that are

877
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,559
really really interested in a a lot of

878
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,080
different things

879
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
they you know they hack different types

880
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,480
of software different types of hardware

881
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,159
you have a

882
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,960
composition of just really cool people

883
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,640
that you can make friends with that you

884
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,120
can take away a lot of knowledge from

885
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,519
um and exchange information with

886
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,120
and it's just so exciting and

887
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,840
mind-blowing

888
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,519
so

889
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,279
you know

890
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,039
those are the takeaways but there's

891
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,559
still one more thing

892
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,960
one more story that remained after the

893
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,240
ctf

894
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,600
and i don't know how many of you have

895
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,279
read the abstract but were any of you

896
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,200
curious what the special cucumber in it

897
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,679
is about

898
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,919
because cucumbers have something to do

899
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,320
with defcon ctf

900
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,640
now the story goes at this like this

901
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,399
effectively

902
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,000
my friend told me that getting

903
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,080
vegetables in las vegas is close to

904
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,760
impossible

905
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,159
so he got very desperate

906
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,080
um and at the end of it all when he

907
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,640
returned to zurich he told me that oh

908
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,360
you know the first thing i did when i

909
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,799
came here

910
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,640
was to go to a store

911
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,760
and i bought a cucumber

912
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and on that note it really makes me

913
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,960
happy that you're all here here

914
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,720
you can clearly see that you know you

915
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,159
have the the excitement and the

916
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,399
willingness to learn and and the want to

917
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,919
kind of experience these types of crazy

918
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:16,960
things

919
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,120
so i suggest that you go out and play

920
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,480
ctfs

921
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,159
uh you go out and have fun you meet

922
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,720
these people and you learn a lot

923
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,840
and remember if you ever go to vegas

924
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,240
bring your vegetables

925
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:38,720
[Applause]

926
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,000
do you have any questions from the

927
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,399
audience

928
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,679
i wonder if i can throw this thing at

929
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,840
you

930
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,559
i'm not sure if that's going to reach

931
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,720
but

932
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,200
maybe not

933
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,720
[Laughter]

934
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,720
hello

935
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,639
let's see it started around the age of

936
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,079
15 so seven years

937
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,239
on and off though like uh quite a lot of

938
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,760
it was in university so i'm currently in

939
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,918
third year um so the last two years have

940
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,879
been very intense in that regard um

941
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,960
but yeah just on and off the past seven

942
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,839
years

943
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,760
do we want do you want the mic or do you

944
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,639
have any recommendations

945
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:43,918
that's

946
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:44,960
um

947
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,359
that's a good question actually

948
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,520
i would say that

949
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,359
it's really about

950
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,000
going out to communities online

951
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,918
lots of these ctf teams they just play

952
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,160
online you know eventually

953
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,680
as you play more you start meeting

954
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,119
people

955
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,640
then you might start getting invited to

956
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,640
certain teams so it's

957
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,240
on one hand it's just showing that you

958
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,320
have the enthusiasm i know learning new

959
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,560
things and then someone will take you on

960
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,720
i think online communities are number

961
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,320
one for that because that's where

962
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,359
everyone is sitting you know when we're

963
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,599
playing ctf's we're all connected

964
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,560
um

965
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,320
so get out there you know start chatting

966
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,119
to people um get to know them

967
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,400
and that's that's you know that's how

968
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,240
organizers were formed we

969
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,280
we're just a bunch of people that were

970
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,119
like hey we want to play defcon

971
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,200
and then it all of a sudden turn into a

972
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,720
massive team

973
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,400
so it's really about chatting to others

974
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,680
and finding people with similar

975
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,760
interests

976
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,599
yeah so what kind of job are you gonna

977
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,960
be looking for when you graduate

978
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,720
well uh my interest is in

979
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,640
malware so threat intelligence malware

980
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,720
reverse engineering um

981
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,560
and that's what i've been focusing on

982
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,400
throughout my university life so that's

983
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,880
kind of one aspect that i was looking at

984
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,160
but i've been thinking recently that i

985
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,839
would like to also branch out to things

986
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,760
like vulnerability research

987
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,640
um

988
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,520
and you know things like that and ctfs

989
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,520
are a great way to get into that because

990
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,800
there's usually lots of reverse

991
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,160
engineering going on

992
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,079
and especially pawning things like

993
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,480
that's always going to be there um so i

994
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,200
thought that you know ctfs are within my

995
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,560
interest i'm just going to take what i

996
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,599
learned there and bringing out to to to

997
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,760
my career

998
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,800
so

999
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,400
which might be surprising to some people

1000
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,560
i actually study mathematics

1001
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,320
and you know it's

1002
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,560
people ask me this question a lot

1003
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,560
and why the hell am i doing mathematics

1004
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,000
when i'm doing all this cyber security

1005
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,520
stuff

1006
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,320
but the way i look at it is that

1007
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,440
maths

1008
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,240
takes you up into abstraction and it

1009
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,320
really makes me think about problems in

1010
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,240
a very different way

1011
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,480
and that i find very helpful when

1012
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,400
solving ctf challenges

1013
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,640
uh because it you really start you know

1014
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,880
trying to find structure in the things

1015
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,079
that you're doing and that's what you do

1016
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,200
in maths

1017
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,680
um so i like applying just the way of

1018
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,520
problem solving in mathematics to the to

1019
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,839
problem solving in ctfs and at the same

1020
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,200
time you know when i look at crypto

1021
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,880
challenges then there's lots of maths

1022
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,160
involved

1023
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,760
and so that's just directly helpful to

1024
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,359
me because that maths background gives

1025
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,680
me gives gives me an edge uh if i'm

1026
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,359
looking at anything cryptography but

1027
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,280
otherwise it's really about i think the

1028
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,880
the problem-solving aspect of my degree

1029
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,680
all right

1030
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,119
you have a question what resources would

1031
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,520
you recommend

1032
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,560
oh there's quite a few so

1033
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,119
personally i started with a book called

1034
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,800
practical malware analysis it's

1035
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,480
available on no starch it's a great

1036
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,560
resource for books by the way do look it

1037
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,440
up

1038
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,280
and

1039
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,960
and there is

1040
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,960
basically books but i know that doesn't

1041
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,720
work for some people

1042
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,560
that particular book does have like lab

1043
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,079
exercises at the end where you actually

1044
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,079
do hands-on stuff and reverse like

1045
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,920
malware that was made for the purposes

1046
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,960
of the book

1047
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,760
um

1048
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,280
but on the other hand there's just lots

1049
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,800
of resources online there is like a

1050
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,040
github repository that has like a

1051
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,960
massive list of

1052
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,640
of different books different blogs

1053
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,160
different websites

1054
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,800
um and of course i think resource number

1055
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,760
one would also be ctfs

1056
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,320
you know go play things like pico ctf

1057
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,599
the challenges are not going to be that

1058
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,200
hard but if you've never done reversing

1059
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,720
before that's probably going to be where

1060
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,079
you want to start

1061
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,640
and then eventually if you get you know

1062
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,079
a bit more comfortable with those you

1063
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,599
start looking at pages like reversing.kr

1064
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,960
and you know read write-ups do ctfs

1065
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,320
because reverse engineering is a lot

1066
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,920
about practice you're not going to be

1067
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,000
reading assembly unless you actively

1068
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,160
read assembly

1069
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,760
so

1070
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,440
basically there's there's a couple of

1071
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,040
these resources online

1072
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,400
which has like a massive list that i

1073
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,320
would recommend looking at

1074
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,520
and just go and do things

1075
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:10,880
i think

1076
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,640
that is all the questions that we had

1077
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,598
so we'll finish up now
