1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,120
what is going to be discussed in this

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,400
talk

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,840
first of all

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,480
i'm going to talk about the brownswords

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,840
concepts of laws 1.5.0

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,680
and that's basically to

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,880
set a bedrock layer on

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,000
how the law tries to adapt digital

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,720
assets and the internet as well

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,280
i'll try to quickly go through that to

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,440
give everyone context

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,360
second part of the talk will be

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,640
specifically talking about two of four

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,039
of the main legal issues with uh

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,879
web 3.0

16
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:47,920
really

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,199
using nfps as an example

18
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,840
and then the third one uh i'll talk

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,280
about

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,239
more of

21
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,559
the trends as to where the law might be

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,039
heading or could head in the future to

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,600
make it more secure for everyone using

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,960
this technology uh this third section

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,280
will be a lot more open if you want to

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,240
if anyone's got any ideas obviously you

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,880
guys are more experts in this field when

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,799
it comes to technology

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,759
and

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,759
when it comes to law especially

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,240
speculating about the future of law

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,560
we genuinely believe that there are no

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,720
stupid questions and there are no

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,759
idiotic ideas literally everything can

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,119
be argued if you've got a basis for it

36
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,360
so start off law 1.0 this is your

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,560
traditional basic standard law that has

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,720
been operating since the beginning of

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,000
human society uh it is what governs your

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,439
day-to-day lives uh you probably

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,000
have already been applying law 1.0

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
throughout your life even just getting

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,280
here uh don't go the speed limit

44
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,320
uh

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,960
pay a fair on public transport

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,680
hopefully don't kill anybody uh

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,318
you know everybody knows what law 1.0 is

48
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,280
but

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
law 1.0 had to change when the digital

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,920
revolution happened

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,959
and

52
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,239
the digital revolution is um

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,400
if you don't know it's

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,440
an idea that was sort of described as

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,480
happening somewhere around 1995

56
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,680
and it's basically when the law had to

57
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,239
realize what cyberspace was

58
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,080
the internet was becoming more and more

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,599
common in public and professional usage

60
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,040
uh so

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,360
clearly the law had to deal with this

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,160
completely new scenario

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,519
uh

64
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,560
so a lot of philosophical legal debates

65
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,519
started cropping up as to how we should

66
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,959
treat

67
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,680
sacrifice you know is it a jurisdiction

68
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,959
of its own

69
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,959
uh independent from the physical

70
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,840
jurisdiction if so what laws should

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,080
apply to sacrifice should it have its

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,680
own laws

73
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,720
whatsoever if we start applying our own

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,599
jurisdictions laws to cyberspace

75
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,200
what's stopping

76
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,120
someone

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,440
from your jurisdiction

78
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,680
you know committing a crime

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,319
which is legal where you are physically

80
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,040
but crime somewhere else in the world

81
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,599
which is also using cyberspace

82
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,879
so

83
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,560
because these are all very difficult

84
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
questions to answer

85
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,480
what lawmakers decided to do is

86
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,280
basically set up a big fat wall around

87
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,720
cyberspace and we decided to cut it off

88
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,239
metabolically

89
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,280
and

90
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,239
wait a few decades until we figured out

91
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,920
an answer

92
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,120
and this is where well to carry on this

93
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,159
metaphor uh up the wall

94
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,599
lawmakers interpret cyberspace as being

95
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,840
a sort of new

96
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,920
it's a totally independent new

97
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,599
jurisdiction which somehow borders every

98
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,000
single country in the world

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,799
and

100
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,159
south face is then colonized so to speak

101
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,439
by

102
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,879
independent

103
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,680
individuals or private individuals uh

104
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,358
and businesses

105
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,320
who carve up territories territories of

106
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,280
cyberspace which we call websites

107
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
that allow us in the physical

108
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,479
jurisdiction

109
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,680
access

110
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,400
so that we can experience scientists for

111
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,680
ourselves

112
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,080
and this is where law 2.0 comes in

113
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,120
so

114
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,280
law 1.0

115
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,600
can be interpreted

116
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,759
you know for new things that are coming

117
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,720
in

118
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,160
uh we can reinterpret we can apply law

119
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,199
uh

120
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,680
sort of look at the spirit of what was

121
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,600
said at the time and tried to

122
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,479
extrapolate how new scenarios are dealt

123
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,639
with

124
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,680
but this is kind of hard when it comes

125
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,440
to more rigid aspects of law so for

126
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,720
example in the turning of the 20th

127
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,479
century in the uk uh it took uh

128
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,960
legislators in the uk

129
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,600
uh the time it took for

130
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,360
the average speed of cars to double

131
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,960
by the time uh legislation is passed to

132
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
increase the speed limit

133
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,240
basically just because in the late 1800s

134
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,880
lawmakers of the day couldn't comprehend

135
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,199
cars going any faster than 12 miles per

136
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,800
hour

137
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
so

138
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,759
we're applying

139
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,039
a system of laws that were developed in

140
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,759
say the early 90s and prior to the

141
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,080
situation right here right now in the

142
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,720
digital world which

143
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,800
who could have predicted where we are

144
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,720
right now back then unless you were

145
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
writing a science fiction bubble

146
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,160
basically

147
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,080
so law 2.0

148
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,840
tries to create a sort of middleman

149
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,240
system where

150
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,960
there's a concept of intermediary and

151
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,400
platform regulation ipr

152
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,880
this is where we respect that private

153
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,160
individuals and companies are the ones

154
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,120
uh you know colonizing cyberspace

155
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,039
they're the ones allowing us access to

156
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,960
cyberspace they're probably going to be

157
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,960
the experts on cyberspace so

158
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,639
what we do

159
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,680
is we take the companies in the physical

160
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,440
world and we apply our laws onto them

161
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,639
so that they

162
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,000
apply

163
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,840
vaguely the law onto their segment of

164
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,520
cyberspace

165
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,039
but anything that isn't touched on by

166
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,000
our laws our law 1.0 they're allowed to

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,520
self-regulate

168
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
they're like to do whatever you want and

169
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,919
a good example of this is

170
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,800
you know for example the

171
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
uh

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,039
the capsule riots in america uh

173
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,560
last year the year before

174
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,680
um where trump and many transporters

175
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,759
were banned off of facebook and twitter

176
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,880
no law in the real world allowed them to

177
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,560
do it it was purely under

178
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,720
self-regulation and they now set up

179
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,080
their own internal cyber courts

180
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,800
which allow them to you know completely

181
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
decide what these laws are within their

182
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,680
own territories

183
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,520
so

184
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,680
yeah to explain how this middleman

185
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,599
system works as well just from another

186
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,840
angle

187
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,440
say you're on facebook

188
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,280
if you find illegal content on facebook

189
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,919
uh which you know is clearly illegal

190
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,560
like it's a

191
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,919
porn being angled to six-year-olds or

192
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,960
something

193
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,440
if you report that to facebook facebook

194
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,240
has a duty under ipr

195
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,560
to deal with that

196
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,879
completely ban that user remove the

197
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,360
content no matter what it is just deal

198
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,639
with it

199
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,199
but if they knowingly harbor illegal

200
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,000
content without doing anything

201
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,560
our physical jurisdictions can then take

202
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,879
legal action against the physical

203
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,080
companies

204
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,599
so it is this sort of so long as you

205
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,440
make sure that nobody's doing anything

206
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,640
illegal we'll turn our backs in nature

207
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,559
that will just allow you to do whatever

208
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,958
you want

209
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,159
then issues that started to arise from

210
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,760
this system very quickly um with the

211
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,360
rise of the second digital revolution

212
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,040
which is believed to be roughly in

213
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,959
around the 2010s

214
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,839
and it was the rise of social media and

215
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,640
the rise of the information economy

216
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,760
if you don't know what the information

217
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,519
economy is it's basically when we travel

218
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,800
these territories of cyberspace uh there

219
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,680
is essentially a tax levied on donors

220
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,560
where

221
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,399
the people who own the websites the

222
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,680
companies

223
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,880
will harvest a portion of our data so

224
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,800
that they can sell it on to other

225
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,199
companies

226
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,839
now 1.0 didn't know how to deal with

227
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,640
this so law 2.0

228
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,800
also didn't know how to deal with this

229
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,040
it therefore came under self-regulation

230
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,080
you know

231
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,320
that meant that these companies who were

232
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,040
profiting the most from this information

233
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,920
economy were the ones in charge of this

234
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,519
information economy

235
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,519
and of course these companies became

236
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,480
insanely rich because of it you know

237
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,839
look at the big five

238
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,240
uh web-based companies in the world

239
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,120
today

240
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,519
quite a lot of them are either purely

241
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,760
social media or have social media

242
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,839
aspects to them and it all started from

243
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,399
the second digital revolution and the

244
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,600
money count

245
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,480
of

246
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,279
you know

247
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,440
this fully untapped free unregulated

248
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
market that they could just do whatever

249
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,360
they wanted with

250
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,079
so i've also got a quote here which is

251
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:16,959
from

252
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,480
everyone's favorite

253
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,120
ex-health minister matt hancock before

254
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,640
he was health minister where he

255
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,920
described this situation of

256
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,360
uh

257
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,839
of the internet as a wild west free frog

258
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,800
and

259
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,399
you know he was right to be fair

260
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,920
so this is where law 3.0 comes in and

261
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,200
lot 3.0 is the proposed complete

262
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,600
harmonization of law and technology

263
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,079
where you you're not capable of doing

264
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,560
anything illegal because there are

265
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,800
already systems built into what you're

266
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,760
doing to prevent something which under

267
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,079
every circumstance is illegal a good

268
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,440
example of this is trains uh before

269
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,600
health and safety law uh said that a

270
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,279
driver couldn't

271
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,200
unlock and open the doors until the

272
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,040
training company closed after

273
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,959
well now the law has completely

274
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,560
integrated into the technology so that

275
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,079
you know under

276
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,519
most general circumstances the door

277
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,279
will not open

278
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,680
at all until the train has physically

279
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,360
come to a standstill

280
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,839
yeah

281
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,720
so lots 8.0 in cyberspace in the digital

282
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,079
environment

283
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,079
it's the proposed idea of taking the

284
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,800
self-regulating power away from its

285
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,079
private bodies and individuals

286
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:40,959
and

287
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,360
uh applying the law directly onto

288
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,040
cyberspace

289
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,720
the first successful implementation of

290
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,240
wallpaper

291
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,800
is arguably the eu's gdpr as we all know

292
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,680
uh

293
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,079
it imposes regulations on the

294
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,439
information economy itself

295
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,519
it set boundaries for companies

296
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,519
operating in this system

297
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,360
and i like to refer to this as cyber

298
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,279
capitalism where it's basically a

299
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,079
digital market

300
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
a digital market controlled by private

301
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,120
bodies subject to limited state imposed

302
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,800
regulations

303
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,639
the information economy from this point

304
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,519
onwards was supposed to

305
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,360
comply completely with these sets of

306
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,160
regulations and standards to best

307
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,000
safeguard the well-being of the everyday

308
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,639
user us when we

309
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,040
access the internet and we have our data

310
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,560
harvested we now have the option to say

311
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,200
no or we have the option to understand

312
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,800
what data is being taken from us and we

313
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,719
can consent different levels of it

314
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,480
so that is law 2.5 where we are right

315
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,519
now

316
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,360
most aspects on the internet are still

317
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,839
self-regulated you know the recent

318
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,079
example of uh the trump supporters being

319
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,120
back facebook

320
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,000
but there is still a lot of

321
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,920
regulation being

322
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,160
increasingly implemented especially to

323
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,440
do with cyber capitalism and

324
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,839
there is a system of harmonization as

325
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,880
well which gets around the initial

326
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,600
arguments of well whose jurisdictions

327
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,240
laws apply to cyberspace then

328
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,000
because the gdpr

329
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
sets up a system

330
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,000
where cyber capitalism only really

331
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,959
operates in the eu but then if you are a

332
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,480
company which is based outside of eu but

333
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,560
want to tap into that market because

334
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,000
there's a lot of people who access the

335
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,839
internet in the eu you're going to want

336
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,240
to access that market

337
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,279
gdpr says that if you do you need to

338
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,800
comply with these rules as well

339
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,880
this then influences

340
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,639
the countries and jurisdictions that

341
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,800
these companies are based in to then

342
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,440
also change their laws and comply

343
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,399
essentially

344
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,760
with gdpr even if it's not officially

345
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,800
compliant with gdpr

346
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,199
and then therefore you know these

347
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,920
companies say with the uk for example

348
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,880
we're not part of the eu anymore but our

349
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,279
legislation is still harmonized with

350
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,600
gdpr we haven't changed the legislation

351
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,639
since you know leaving the eu so it's

352
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,240
still basically exactly the same

353
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,160
even though we're not in the eu any

354
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,880
company that then wants to access

355
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,760
us

356
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,320
as a market and take our data when we're

357
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,480
using the internet they also need to

358
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,240
comply with

359
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,800
uh cyber capitals

360
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,839
so it is this sort of spreading

361
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,720
uh

362
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,399
harmonization effect really

363
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,079
and well

364
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,639
that is basically how the law treats

365
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,279
cyberspace so section two

366
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,279
nfts

367
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,720
what are they if you don't know already

368
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,560
nft stands for non-fungible token token

369
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,360
meaning it is a piece of code on a

370
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,959
blockchain which represents uh a well

371
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,600
it's a completely unique one-of-kind

372
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,399
code on a blockchain which represents a

373
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,160
digital asset

374
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,959
and so that's why i've got this uh

375
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,760
lovely thumbs up and down representation

376
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,399
because when we talk about nfts

377
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,360
there's a lot of conflation between what

378
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,600
is defined as an nft

379
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,240
the actual image itself

380
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,600
legally and literally is not an nft that

381
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,360
is a digital asset

382
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,720
the nft itself is the token is the bit

383
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,519
of code that you access which then

384
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,399
permits you access to using and

385
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,560
acquiring and viewing

386
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,440
the digital asset whether it's an image

387
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,680
or a guest or you know whatever

388
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,600
and

389
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,480
the

390
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,240
theoretical appeal of nfts is

391
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,040
the example that's often used is

392
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,000
uh with oil paintings you know you've

393
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,920
got an oil painting

394
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,759
you can either buy

395
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,680
that specific original piece of art made

396
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,079
by the artist or you can buy a print on

397
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,360
them

398
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,440
and the argument with nfts is when you

399
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,199
buy an nft

400
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,120
you are basically

401
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,880
gaining ownership of the oil painting

402
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
and anyone else who copies it or

403
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,120
screenshots it as we get onto it is

404
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,920
merely uh getting a print

405
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,720
of that piece of part

406
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,440
why is the law an issue on this

407
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,959
well ensure that the law is really made

408
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,720
to protect scientists to protect society

409
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,560
and this of course extends into keeping

410
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,120
the best interests of everyone you know

411
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,480
kept or at least the most amount of

412
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,320
people

413
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,000
the nft market is worth billions of

414
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,079
dollars

415
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,799
the most expensive nft being sold i

416
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,000
still believe is this one on the left

417
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,359
uh

418
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,880
the big one the collage uh where it was

419
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,480
valued and sold at nearly 70 million

420
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,160
dollars

421
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,880
that's a lot even just for a physical

422
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,079
asset

423
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,679
but then we've got

424
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,919
it's a digital asset and we've got the

425
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,240
issues of laws 1.0 to 3.0 trying to

426
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,559
consider on top of the

427
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,120
stresses of having to protect something

428
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,799
that valuable

429
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,240
uh another example is the other one

430
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,480
the other image here in the car

431
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,160
uh

432
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,360
it's subject to a very recent legal case

433
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,600
which has only just started

434
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,280
so of course we don't have a lot of

435
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,080
details open to the public but basically

436
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,840
what happened was matt fury who

437
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,960
is the

438
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,000
original artist of pick and frog

439
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,679
decided to create an nfc series

440
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,520
where this image was sold as a unique

441
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,679
limited edition one-of-a-kind

442
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,039
and it was sold for around 500 000

443
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,039
two weeks later

444
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,919
on the same blockchain he released 46

445
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,600
identical versions of this asset for

446
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,240
free to just random people who didn't

447
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,760
buy it so of course the person who paid

448
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,160
500 000

449
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,280
for this image is taking mr fury to

450
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,240
court uh

451
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,280
what will actually happen uh from this

452
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,919
legal case no one actually knows because

453
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,960
the law is so undefined when it comes to

454
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,400
digital assets and nfcs it literally

455
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,880
could swing in favor of either way

456
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,760
we

457
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,400
cannot predict right now so if you're

458
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,880
interested that's probably a story to

459
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,919
keep in mind but legal cases do take

460
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,240
years to complete so whether you can

461
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,840
keep your attentions back up from that

462
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,799
ball it's up to two days

463
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,120
um

464
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,919
now i need to start talking about

465
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,400
property rights because it's very

466
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,600
important when it comes to digital

467
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,440
assets

468
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,760
in scott's law we define property as

469
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,919
having two properties

470
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,200
it's movableness and it's corporealness

471
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,080
with corporeal meaning physicalness so

472
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,280
basically heritable and movable is

473
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,880
whether you can move it or can't move it

474
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,760
and corporeal and incorporeal

475
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,840
isn't physical is it real

476
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,520
can you touch it and put it in your

477
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,720
pocket or not

478
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,280
these distinctions

479
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,320
allow us to separate out

480
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,960
ownership and property rights

481
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,480
so the ownership rate

482
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,120
completely different to the rates you

483
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,919
get when you own an inquiry movable

484
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,200
property so understanding

485
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,760
what kind of

486
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,960
what kind of property something is is

487
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,440
very important for the law if it's not

488
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,520
defined already in a bit of legislation

489
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,480
so the first issue when it comes to nfds

490
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,919
is theft when someone screenshots an nfg

491
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,840
one of the common arguments against it

492
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,480
is to claim ownership through blockchain

493
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,200
and accuse the other person of stealing

494
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,760
their property

495
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,120
now theft in scott's law and i realize i

496
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
will be talking about scott's law purely

497
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,679
because i am a scots law student

498
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,200
but i i

499
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,960
clarify i do learn about uk wide law eu

500
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,200
law some aspects of international law

501
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
and everything that i talk about

502
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,320
while the definitions might be purely in

503
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,880
scott's law the overall spirit of the

504
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,080
law is basically concurrent at least to

505
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,080
the entirety of you

506
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
normally it's internationally but

507
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,520
there's little bits here and there

508
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,640
that's different

509
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,559
so theft

510
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,280
in scott's law is a common law of crime

511
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,840
that means there isn't actually one

512
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,799
definition of it there is multiple rules

513
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,600
that have been built up over cases so

514
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,320
every time a judge decides something new

515
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,600
about a theft case that is ticked on as

516
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,400
part of the definition of theft

517
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,559
uh this here is

518
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,120
taken from one of my textbooks and i

519
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,640
believe it

520
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,320
really sort of encapsulates all of the

521
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,640
rules uh in together

522
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,600
so the taking and or appropriating of

523
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,159
property belonging to another without

524
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,480
their consent with the intention to

525
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,600
deprive them of its use

526
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,880
one thing

527
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,919
this definition does miss out though is

528
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,919
the shared belief

529
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,960
across pretty much every legal system

530
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,120
that property

531
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,679
must be corporeal

532
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,559
and movable for it to be stolen

533
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,960
for theft to occur you need to be able

534
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,640
to pick it up

535
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,840
pocket it

536
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,520
and move it away from the place it was

537
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,840
put down by the owner of the property

538
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,640
and

539
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,120
of course the first issue here when it

540
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,720
comes to nfcs

541
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,159
is clearly corporealness

542
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,480
are nfts corporeal

543
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,480
no they're not digital is the antithesis

544
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,919
of physical uh it's a piece of code

545
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,679
you cannot pick this piece of code up

546
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,520
you cannot pocket it you cannot walk

547
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
away with it therefore

548
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,200
it isn't a physical corporeal asset it

549
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,679
cannot be legally stolen

550
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,640
under

551
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,880
any jurisdiction

552
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,480
but say the law changes though and

553
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,039
digital assets start being treated as

554
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,039
though they are physical

555
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,720
i will get onto

556
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,520
that line of argument later because

557
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,159
there is a chance that in 10 years we

558
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,480
will have exceptions to the rule when it

559
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,720
comes to theft

560
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,320
we would then have to think about

561
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
deprivation

562
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,400
now if you watch any crime drama or

563
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
courtroom drama you'll probably

564
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,880
recognize the phrases actus race in

565
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,080
menswear

566
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,640
it's basically the idea that for a crime

567
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,159
to have happened

568
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,840
you need

569
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,720
the

570
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,679
action

571
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,640
of a crime and the intentions to commit

572
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,159
the crime

573
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,679
so

574
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,559
the action for theft is purely just the

575
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,000
deprivation

576
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,600
doesn't matter whether the thief

577
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,880
benefits from the asset or not all that

578
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,679
matters is that the owner of the

579
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,240
property

580
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,440
doesn't have it anymore or can't benefit

581
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,279
from its use

582
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,279
specifically

583
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,240
so here in the corner we have a rather

584
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,360
famous nft uh which is part of the

585
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,679
boarding yacht club collection

586
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,360
and if you don't recognize it this

587
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,840
specific piece is owned by talk show

588
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,360
host jimmy fallon uh he does what a lot

589
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,320
of uh so-called crypto bros uh do where

590
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,720
they put their uh

591
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,039
most expensive or favorite

592
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,640
nfc as their profile

593
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,760
but what's stopping you from say

594
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,000
screenshotting uh mr fallon's uh nft and

595
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
sacrificing the dignity of your new

596
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,360
twitter profile

597
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,000
uh and applying it as your own coca

598
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,400
picture

599
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,440
am i

600
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,159
depriving mr fallon from his property

601
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,520
here

602
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,240
you can check on twitter right now and

603
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,600
you can

604
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,880
see for yourselves whether both of us

605
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,600
either of us are depriving one another

606
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,640
from using this image

607
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,320
or benefiting from his property

608
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,840
that's probably a better way to describe

609
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,480
it am i preventing fallon from

610
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,600
benefiting from his ownership of that

611
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,760
nft

612
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,640
no not really

613
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,720
could you not argue that the fact that

614
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,799
he is

615
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,559
you could certainly argue that it's

616
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,240
reduced its benefit yes but would that

617
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,520
come under

618
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,279
would that come under stealing it

619
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,679
oh yeah carry on what will be override

620
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,600
balls

621
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,200
smart man

622
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,440
two slides later i'm getting onto coffee

623
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,600
right now

624
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,960
um

625
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,240
any other questions

626
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,520
okay

627
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,480
uh

628
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,840
right

629
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,600
sorry i do have a script here just

630
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,000
um

631
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,440
yes what's up

632
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,960
this is a general issue with web 3.0

633
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,840
when it comes to set or

634
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,159
taking of digital assets without

635
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,240
permission

636
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,480
what if i school fallon's

637
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,400
wallet that the nft

638
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,159
that the literal nxt is on bits of code

639
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,120
what if

640
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,080
someone here hacked into his account

641
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,679
and then sold

642
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,480
his mft for puppets on the blockchain to

643
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,679
yourselves

644
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,360
well you would think that maybe that is

645
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,679
stressed at that point

646
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,679
that you know maybe it's coming right

647
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,400
but

648
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,760
current legal interpretation

649
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,840
doesn't actually allow that

650
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,720
it still isn't fed you've got loads of

651
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,640
cases in america uk all across the eu of

652
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,480
people stealing one another's crypto

653
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,760
currencies which are also digital assets

654
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
on the blockchain it's just

655
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,399
they're not non-vulnerable

656
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,640
and not a single one of them has been

657
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,399
charged with theft or at least

658
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,760
successfully charged with them

659
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
often comes under some other

660
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,799
economic crime like extortion or what

661
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,399
have you

662
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,000
but that is a totally different field

663
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,159
though

664
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,240
so then

665
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,200
we come to the second issue intellectual

666
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,200
property and copyright block

667
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,480
copyright is the protection of

668
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,000
expression

669
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,760
intellectual property

670
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,799
is creative ideas that copyright law

671
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,320
recognizes as your creations and

672
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,360
therefore gives you rights of ownership

673
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,840
over it

674
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,840
these rights are protective and they

675
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,039
prevent anyone from

676
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,919
using adapting uh

677
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,039
selling your creative property without

678
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,360
it being considered an infringement and

679
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,960
you can take legal actions against them

680
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,720
so this relates back to the property

681
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,559
rights explained earlier

682
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,080
ip is incorporeal movable property that

683
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,159
means it cannot be stolen

684
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,399
but you do get certain different other

685
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,360
rights associated which means no one can

686
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,120
use it without you know your permission

687
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,080
or you know you've got a system in place

688
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,440
where if someone does use it

689
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,679
they need to pay royalties for example

690
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,000
they don't need to consistently ask the

691
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,320
person who owns copyright

692
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,159
you know whether they can get permission

693
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,080
they just pay a little fee and then you

694
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,639
can use it

695
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,520
explain how it isn't theft and the

696
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,440
differences between

697
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,159
incorporeal and corporeal

698
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,840
movable rights

699
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,720
is

700
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,320
with a lot of business espionage cases

701
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,600
where you can

702
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,000
yes

703
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,080
you will have a lot of employees

704
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,679
who steal trade secrets or steal trade

705
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:34,880
secrets

706
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,600
and then try to sell it on to a rival

707
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,039
company

708
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,120
every single time this happens it

709
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,159
doesn't come under theft well yes they

710
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,799
might have stolen some office paper

711
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,559
but they can't steal the information

712
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,039
held on the paper instead they are

713
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,799
attempting to infringe the copyright of

714
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,000
the

715
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,559
of their employer

716
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,159
basically

717
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,120
so when it comes to digital copyright

718
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,600
there is a bit of a struggle here

719
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,559
because

720
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,640
on average

721
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,799
when it comes to any competition between

722
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,799
the digital world cyberspace and

723
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,000
physical world copyright will

724
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,880
animal and legal systems in general will

725
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,000
prepare the physical world in what we do

726
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,480
rather than anything online a good

727
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,559
example is uh the assassin's creed

728
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,080
franchise is pretty famous for

729
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,279
uh

730
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,559
pretty accurately depicting uh

731
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,440
places in our history uh pretty

732
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,520
accurately as to how they would have

733
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,559
been

734
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,720
back then

735
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,840
and

736
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,919
a big gripe in the historic community is

737
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,159
the cathedral of not damn

738
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,200
in south africa unity which is set in i

739
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,000
believe revolutionary france

740
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,279
and

741
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,440
the issue here is because

742
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,519
that isn't not down

743
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,480
it may look like it if you don't live

744
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,080
there all the time and see it all the

745
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,200
time

746
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,679
but it isn't notre dame because there is

747
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,760
copyright over notre dame that the

748
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,640
french government owns as a protected

749
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,399
historic building

750
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,120
and ubisoft couldn't or

751
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,960
didn't want to pay

752
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,120
the inordinate

753
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,559
royalties to gain access to notre dame

754
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,159
so they tried to

755
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,399
stitch together this frankenstein's

756
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,640
version of notre dame while skirting the

757
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,159
edges of copyright infringement

758
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,840
and this is

759
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
where we get into the issue of nfts

760
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,960
again

761
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,000
the only reason iq rights are conveyed

762
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,480
to someone is because legislation

763
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,919
is in place

764
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,120
uh to

765
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,279
prove where copyright does and doesn't

766
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,279
carry over

767
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,360
no legislation currently

768
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
talks about entities or blockchains it

769
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,720
is completely blank on the matter

770
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,279
and that carries with the issue

771
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,240
oh sorry that carries with the issue

772
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,190
of uh

773
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,320
[Music]

774
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,240
yes nfts only actually have the most

775
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,480
basic of ownership rights

776
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,039
that you can use it you can sell it you

777
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,880
can destroy it

778
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,080
that's it

779
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,440
you don't actually own the copy right

780
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,000
over it even if you bought the nft

781
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,760
related to it they just lack it and

782
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,039
that's because we need to look at the

783
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,440
definition of an nfc again

784
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,679
you have the ownership rights over a bit

785
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,360
of code

786
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,880
you don't have the ownership rights over

787
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,519
the asset that the code is related to

788
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,640
if anyone was to try and apply copyright

789
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,279
it would go to the original artist

790
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,720
of the piece

791
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,200
because no legislation is in place to

792
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,240
guarantee that these full

793
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,279
copyright ip ownership rights pass on to

794
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,799
the person who owns it it's a bit like a

795
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,080
bit like how series

796
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,000
it's a bit like how cds are uh

797
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,360
yeah okay right when you're talking

798
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,600
about bar and the comparison of oil

799
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,720
paintings being related to uh nfts that

800
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,320
you're buying an nfc therefore you're

801
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,039
buying an oil painting what it actually

802
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,039
is in practice is

803
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,000
uh an artist's maiden oil painting uh

804
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,200
and they set up a unique limited edition

805
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,760
print of that oil painting which then

806
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,279
you buy

807
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,559
that is how the law treats nfts

808
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,840
so that still allows the artist to

809
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,519
make their own copies if we go to the

810
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,760
map fury case back again

811
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,200
and it

812
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,600
means that you know the person who

813
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,039
bought the nft

814
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,679
doesn't necessarily

815
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,600
have access to change it or adapt it

816
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,120
themselves

817
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,640
uh and i would change them

818
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,840
i will quick fire these

819
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,240
flexibility of the law

820
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,919
relates to

821
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,879
electricity here electricity is not

822
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,000
corporeal it's not physical you cannot

823
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,520
touch it pick it up and put it in your

824
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,480
pocket except law 1.0 has reinterpreted

825
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,399
electricity to

826
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,719
be stolen if you tamper with a meter

827
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,879
you're stealing electricity as depth

828
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,719
that you will be accused of

829
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,959
uh

830
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,399
we'll get to runescape who would have

831
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,000
thought runescape is

832
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,239
actively changing the law of the world

833
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,119
uh

834
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,440
there was a case in the netherlands

835
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,520
where

836
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,839
a runescaper

837
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,119
had a mask and an amulet stolen well

838
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,440
forcibly removed from them by two

839
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,639
runescape pests and this came to

840
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,119
the dutch courts this went all the way

841
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,199
to the supreme court where the supreme

842
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,079
court ruled that the time and effort

843
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,839
that this little boy this little

844
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,359
runescaper had put in to acquiring these

845
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,560
assets gave it the same amount of rights

846
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,040
as a physical asset

847
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,359
so if you put the work in a digital

848
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,760
asset could become

849
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,839
exactly the same as a physical asset in

850
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,200
terms of rights

851
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,400
uh

852
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,040
other real world applications are

853
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,359
the suggestion of linking

854
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,000
physical assets with entities as well

855
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,119
nike set up crypto kicks which is still

856
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,960
in development at the moment but they do

857
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,520
have copyright over the name uh and the

858
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,400
idea is that you could be able to buy an

859
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,599
nfd

860
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,760
of a unique design and then have that

861
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,160
unique design printed as a shoe

862
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,599
and there's also

863
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,920
the the other idea that if you have two

864
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,160
unique designs on the blockchain you can

865
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,640
combine them together to create your own

866
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,839
nike crypto picks nft and then have that

867
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,839
either you know physically made into a

868
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,200
product or you could sell that one

869
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,200
and that is sort of getting around the

870
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,599
issue of copyright not inherently

871
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,320
passing the person who owns it

872
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,440
because

873
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,920
nike are implementing what is called

874
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,960
smart royalties which are still a bit

875
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,960
gray at the moment

876
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,200
and what smart royalty is is

877
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,359
embedded into the code of the nft itself

878
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,440
everything that is sold on again a

879
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,760
percentage of that sale goes back to the

880
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,440
original person who minted the nft

881
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,560
uh and then we also have uh related to

882
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,960
the ukrainian war at the moment ukraine

883
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,640
has set up a meta history museum where

884
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,560
they are preserving their history and

885
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,599
art

886
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,960
on the blockchain and you can buy it

887
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,359
and all proceeds go to the preservation

888
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,119
of the ukrainian state

889
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,520
and this also brings up the questions of

890
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,079
how can we use nfts to preserve art

891
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,320
which might not be around for a while

892
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
such and how do we support these

893
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,560
industries such as street art where

894
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,800
street art is often done

895
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,839
you know

896
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,079
you make a bit street art it's gone by

897
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,680
the weekend

898
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,680
and these people make amazing pieces of

899
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,720
art

900
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,040
without a penny being given to them

901
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,560
and how do we

902
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,800
you know work around that and i do

903
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,720
apologize for rushing that last section

904
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,280
i did ramble a bit if anyone's got any

905
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,400
questions or suggestions or anything you

906
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,040
can try now yeah carry on

907
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,280
what if you have like something like an

908
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,560
nft on a usb track right like a physical

909
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,599
wall

910
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,839
and that gets stolen

911
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,040
what's the evaluation

912
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,099
[Applause]

913
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,640
that's true um

914
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,470
yeah uh

915
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:51,780
[Applause]

916
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,880
[Music]

917
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,560
well firstly it would depend what

918
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
cryptocurrency is on it whether it is

919
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,320
respected in the jurisdiction that is

920
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,560
stolen in at some jurisdictions of

921
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,480
outright banned cryptocurrencies so that

922
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,720
would have a value of zero dollars uh

923
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,320
while say ethereum is accepted to uh

924
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,720
traded uh bitcoin is

925
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,040
legal tender in some places

926
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,680
full rights of currency

927
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,720
but

928
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,320
there could be an argument that that

929
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,160
would come under the uh

930
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,000
the same interpretation as business

931
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,599
espionage cases

932
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,760
where you've got the actual incorporeal

933
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,480
information uh printed on a piece of

934
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,520
paper

935
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,359
if you steal this

936
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,800
literally you've only stolen the piece

937
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,920
of paper

938
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,480
the information inside it technically

939
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,000
hasn't been stolen because it's not

940
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,800
corporeal in nature

941
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,760
but

942
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,359
i don't know of many cases that are

943
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,280
specifically like that there could be

944
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,680
some which prove me wrong

945
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,440
because it is you know a lot of

946
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,599
interpretation but that would be my

947
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,359
initial reaction

948
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,480
to how that would go

949
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,920
under

950
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,960
which countries

951
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:16,720
okay

952
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,279
for example

953
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,280
you live in ukraine and you applied for

954
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,160
it in spain

955
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,599
uh

956
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,880
it would depend

957
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,000
where it is stolen and

958
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,400
the laws of where the thief is at the

959
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,119
moment so scott's law is currently an

960
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,800
adoption where if something is stolen

961
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,040
anywhere and then the thief comes to

962
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,320
scotland scotland will prosecute

963
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,800
the act of theft under their law rather

964
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,520
than

965
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,960
the jurisdiction that was actually

966
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,240
stolen

967
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,359
which is fairly unique

968
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,520
but it all depends on the laws of the

969
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,800
judiciary uh when it comes to banning uh

970
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,200
cryptocurrencies and uh a lot of likes

971
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,839
3.0 entirely uh

972
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,880
islamic law is the third largest legal

973
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,240
system behind civil and common law and

974
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,359
because it is uh highly influenced by

975
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,920
the religion of islam uh

976
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,000
there is a lot of restrictions or bans

977
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,319
on the spectrum to trading which

978
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,040
cryptocurrencies and nfts are basically

979
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,760
a game of hot potato see who can you

980
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,240
know make the most money it's not a very

981
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,079
certain uh

982
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,440
currency or way of trading so a lot of

983
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,480
islamic countries have outright banned

984
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
cryptocurrencies from

985
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,960
legally being used in their country or

986
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,520
even if they are being used uh their

987
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,040
value is nothing

988
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,000
so uh i think that answers your question

989
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,440
yeah okay

990
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,000
thank you for

991
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,960
yeah it depends on the jurisdiction of

992
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,200
where it was stolen uh and where the

993
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,960
thief is if you don't know where the

994
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,800
thief is then

995
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,680
you know arguably who can you convict at

996
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,200
that point it would go under

997
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,839
investigation

998
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,400
uh

999
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,480
when it comes to international law there

1000
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,400
are harmonized aspects but when it comes

1001
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,280
to crimes especially digital crimes

1002
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,280
the law is still catching up really uh

1003
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,040
we're almost there when it comes to

1004
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,480
cyber crime

1005
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,520
but say like the uk's cyber crime

1006
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,240
legislation is quite outdated and it

1007
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,119
needs reforming um but other countries

1008
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,800
are more up-to-date

1009
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,800
so

1010
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,959
thank you
