1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,670
so hi guys and welcome thank you very

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,620
much for taking the time to come to my

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,389
talk if you're here because you think

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,099
I'm the beer farmers because you

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,429
actually read the printed book I'm not

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,010
they are downstairs right now am I

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,539
correct yes yes yep so just saying I'm

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,980
not the beer partners I don't even like

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,210
beer

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:33,480
so my name switch it on oh great so my

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,790
name is Helena Lucas I am a student at

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,140
Edinburgh Napier University

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,800
I am studying computer security or cyber

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,320
security and forensics I'm currently on

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,920
placement in a financial institution and

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,780
I used to be on the any tech committee

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,230
yay yay thanks the only reason I'm doing

18
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,420
this talk is because I am trying to get

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,470
more Twitter followers than my dad hears

20
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,390
at 1524 so I need quite a few more so

21
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,179
please follow me my name is hella

22
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:13,049
underscore look I do go by hella rather

23
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:14,909
than Helena sometimes that's because I'm

24
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,469
from Poland and in Poland that's what

25
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:18,420
people call me if you are going to try

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,070
and pronounce it it's hella like hella

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,409
cool rather than hella like HeLa or

28
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,439
hella or anything like that

29
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,859
apart from security I also organize or

30
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:31,380
organized TEDx conferences and I'm very

31
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,359
into TED Talks etc so if you want to

32
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,280
talk about that we can chat afterwards

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,630
and I also do magic tricks so I'm gonna

34
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,630
start off with a disclaimer I am

35
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,210
woefully under qualified to give this

36
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,789
talk I have been hooked on machine

37
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:50,670
learning at university I did one machine

38
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,179
learning project that work and this is

39
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:56,189
the talks that I wished I have seen

40
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,499
before I had said yes to the project I

41
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:01,950
think if you have done machine learning

42
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,719
at university in an academic environment

43
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,100
or at work go away this really isn't the

44
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,330
top free you're not going to learn

45
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,710
anything new I don't think so

46
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,050
I did a poll on Twitter

47
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,450
should I start my litter too hacked 19

48
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,790
talk with a magic trick a few people

49
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,440
said no is anybody he said no in the

50
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,040
audience okay but most people said yes

51
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,990
so I guess I will start with a magic

52
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,070
trick then I do need a volunteer

53
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,810
you're a first sorry he owes first did

54
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,070
you for my favorite what's your name

55
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,070
what a line

56
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,160
Morelli sorry money light Murray light

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,150
yeah why L ye big round of applause

58
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,360
I need you to stand here in between

59
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,010
these lines otherwise the camera can't

60
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,510
get us so actually this is an

61
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,220
interactive magic trick so I need

62
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:13,920
everybody to stand up for this like a

63
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,950
view to the camera yes guys if you like

64
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,690
today just stab you behind the camera

65
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,100
just want a sort of part way slightly

66
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:27,720
just so I didn't think think okay so now

67
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,660
I want everybody to copy Murray okay so

68
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,550
what I'd like you to do is stick your

69
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,060
hands like this like this that includes

70
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,660
you can go full weight no this is the

71
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,640
difficult bit okay I want you turn your

72
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,250
hands over like this this is my favorite

73
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,740
kids trick show and kids show trip

74
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,660
father hey it was very difficult

75
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,580
No very carefully like this yeah perfect

76
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,890
does everybody have it stop waving this

77
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,690
is an important bit okay now when I

78
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,790
count to three I want you to clasp your

79
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,800
fingers like this okay but only once I

80
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,710
count to three okay like that you got it

81
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,340
okay so one two three mm-hmm okay and

82
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,630
now we're gonna do the magic okay we're

83
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,470
gonna go abracadabra

84
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,529
everybody has to say like boom Chicka

85
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:27,219
Boom and now the magic is gonna happen

86
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,220
[Music]

87
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,190
I didn't

88
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,850
there's also a hi welcome please take a

89
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:10,260
seat hi so let's start with the boring

90
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:16,050
stuff so um I will preface this with

91
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,720
this talk thank you for laughing I also

92
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,930
like this I will start with this with

93
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,730
saying that this talk is mainly aimed at

94
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,830
my peers and one of the questions I get

95
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,460
a lot is how is machine learning

96
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,780
actually different from just a really

97
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,960
long complex if statement and I have to

98
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,670
say that it took me quite a while to

99
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,260
actually understand it and in some ways

100
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,270
if you think about it when you distill

101
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,760
it down to the very basics it is

102
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,980
actually still kind of if statements

103
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,390
it's just that they're built up into

104
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,850
this nice big complex thing which deals

105
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,550
with different kinds of problems so

106
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,580
machine learning is a subset of AI that

107
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,190
builds algorithms that allow computers

108
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,810
to learn and perform tasks from data

109
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,710
instead of being explicitly programmed

110
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:07,440
to do things so what I'm trying to say

111
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,540
here is that what machine learning can

112
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,270
do is that you can deal with a

113
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,430
probabilistic and stochastic environment

114
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,010
so one that's changing and different and

115
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,930
it can deal with new data well whereas

116
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,610
an if statement has to be told from the

117
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,050
very start what it's going to be dealing

118
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,230
with so if we try and think about it and

119
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,870
take an example let's say we've got an

120
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,610
if statement that is trying to define

121
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,520
whether something is a dog or not right

122
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,770
if we've got a dog that looks like a

123
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,990
regular dog the if statement could go

124
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,910
through asking if it's got four legs if

125
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,820
it's got two years if it is fluffy you

126
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,100
know that kind of thing and it will

127
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,110
define at the end that it is a dog but

128
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,550
what if we've got a dog that for example

129
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,070
doesn't fill one of those criteria maybe

130
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,290
it doesn't have an ear it doesn't have a

131
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,580
like don't know why I got so dark but

132
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,990
but basically a machine learning

133
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,650
algorithm can actually take the dog and

134
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,240
compare it to other

135
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,120
or look at its features as a whole and

136
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,820
by that define whether it is a dog or

137
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,320
not instead of going through these

138
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,330
defined if statements that we would

139
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:18,060
other amazingly using now I'm going to

140
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,699
take a little bit of time to go through

141
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,530
the differences between artificial

142
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,389
intelligence machine learning and deep

143
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:29,100
learning AI in general as a term that is

144
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,610
misused a lot but it's a program that

145
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,750
can learn sense reason and adapt machine

146
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,090
learning is an application of AI that

147
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,639
focuses on the development of computer

148
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,250
programs that can learn from themselves

149
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,660
now I want to talk a little bit about

150
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,410
deep versus shallow learning as well and

151
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,060
to explain this I need to just quickly

152
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,800
go over what features are so when we've

153
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,139
got a data set for example data set of

154
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,139
dogs features will be things like years

155
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,389
or a number of years or a number of legs

156
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:05,160
or no fluffiness scale etc so in shallow

157
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,620
learning we need domain experts so

158
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,250
insecurity people like us to determine

159
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,620
which features in a dataset are

160
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,310
important in deep learning and this is

161
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,990
out of scope of this talk and it's a

162
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,909
little more complex and I completely do

163
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:24,150
not understand it the program itself

164
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,979
determines what's important and which

165
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,039
features is going to use so this is a

166
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,590
very simplified class in real life

167
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,029
actually looks a little more like this

168
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:35,039
oh we're not gonna go into that because

169
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,760
we don't have to so one drunken any sec

170
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,830
night out my friend Gordon said

171
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,470
something like this I don't understand

172
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,360
unsupervised machine learning can't you

173
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,650
just use the supervisor that the

174
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,110
supervised machine learning uses to

175
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,400
supervise the unsupervised machine

176
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,370
learning so short answer to that is well

177
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:02,430
no however this is an important

178
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:02,910
distinction

179
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,209
so supervised learning requires training

180
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:08,880
on a large labeled data set so whenever

181
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,980
you have let's say network connections

182
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,620
you will have labeled malicious ones and

183
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,870
labeled non malicious ones and whenever

184
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,460
you run your

185
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,040
machine learning model you let the

186
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,200
algorithm sort the data look at the

187
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,090
labels and give them little feedback so

188
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,530
that it can get better about whether

189
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,240
it's classifying it in the right way

190
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,920
this would be in a specific case of

191
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,930
classification but in general you get

192
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:30,500
the idea

193
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,060
you need labels for oh and two examples

194
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,520
of supervised learning would be

195
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,840
classification and regression where

196
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,220
classification you're trying to

197
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,470
determine if something for example is a

198
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,900
dog or not and in regression you are

199
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,730
going to try and predict a continuous

200
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,980
variable so for example a number know

201
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,990
square feet with a house will go into

202
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,150
this nature hi

203
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:03,050
come in please unsupervised learning on

204
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,790
the other hand does not require label

205
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,730
data at a higher level it will look at

206
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,060
how similar things are and to each other

207
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,710
and use this measure to group them

208
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,620
together in certain ways the differences

209
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,230
between different unsupervised machine

210
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,270
learning methods is how they define the

211
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,170
similarity and how they group the things

212
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,660
so there's two kind of main or three

213
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,730
main types of unsupervised learning

214
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,860
there's clustering and it works for

215
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,780
finding inherent groups in data there's

216
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,150
Association where you want to discover

217
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,690
rules for example people who click on X

218
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,670
will also do y I realized I said three I

219
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,700
meant to I can't help you don't need

220
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,320
maps for every learner you do actually

221
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,420
so I'm gonna point you guys to this

222
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,580
brilliant cheat sheet this is for a

223
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,230
second line which has a Python library

224
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,670
which is great for machine learning you

225
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,170
just import something and everything

226
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,080
works not not really true but it's a

227
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,450
great place to start now if you look at

228
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,800
this you might just be going what I will

229
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,480
go through all the different components

230
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,200
and we will start with a regression does

231
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,560
this have

232
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,280
what I'm trying to do is have a laser

233
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,660
pointer yes okay brother

234
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,190
so given a thousand uses for an

235
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,810
Edinburgh you can plot them on a graph

236
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,400
right where we've got I got this wrong

237
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,560
last time we've got the price on the

238
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,840
x-axis and the square feet on the y-axis

239
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,970
I can tell X from Y basically what you

240
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,390
can do in regression is you can try and

241
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:49,330
fit a line to determine what the usual

242
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,370
price of a house with a certain square

243
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,160
footage would be depending on other

244
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,710
houses already in the given area now

245
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,570
this is a very simplistic example

246
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,670
because you're only using two dimensions

247
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,710
usually you would be doing this in three

248
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,330
dimensions or four dimensions or five

249
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,530
but don't think about that too much

250
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,520
because it hurts your brain and in

251
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,590
regression we also need to think about

252
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:17,860
overfitting now basically I'm stepping

253
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,030
over basically when you're building a

254
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,530
machine learning model you need to make

255
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,880
sure that is going to work for a new

256
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,340
data so if for example we go back to

257
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,350
this example and we draw a line that

258
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,910
instead of going straight like this kind

259
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,010
of went up and down and up and down and

260
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,410
fit every single little data point we

261
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,750
would end up with an inaccurate result

262
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,670
whenever we're trying to find any price

263
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,040
for a house over a certain square

264
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,580
footage and you can see this here there

265
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,380
if you under fish at your results are

266
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,990
meaningful at all if you said it well

267
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,180
you're gonna get it just right and if

268
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,180
you over fetch it well you're not going

269
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,040
to get any meaningful results in the end

270
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,330
and I have a mean for this I'll just let

271
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,230
you read it on my blog great okay so

272
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,540
let's keep on going with the graph the

273
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:13,450
next thing is classification which is a

274
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,430
supervised learning approach in which

275
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,380
the computer program learns from

276
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,230
labelled data and uses this to classify

277
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,440
a new observation so it could be by

278
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,210
class it could be multi class so it

279
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,890
could be saying is this a door knocker

280
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,640
it could be

281
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,470
what type of dog is this I really like

282
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,920
dogs now why would we use classification

283
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,140
it actually has loads and loads of use

284
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,940
cases for machine learning you can for

285
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,589
example classify things as malicious or

286
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:41,800
not as you know malware or not as

287
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,649
phishing or not as spam or not spam

288
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,990
which is called Pam this is a scientific

289
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,010
term and the issue with classification

290
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,220
is finding good labelled data sets

291
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,519
because that is difficult and I have

292
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,640
another moon sorry all right the next

293
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,790
one we'll get into is clustering it's an

294
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,500
unsupervised learning method which is

295
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,779
used as a process to find meaningful

296
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:16,320
structure or do things in a set of data

297
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,529
it uses similarity or dissimilarity to

298
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:22,829
put things into categories

299
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:26,760
sorry not how to create center groups

300
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,700
you can use this for explorative

301
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,589
analysis so whenever you've got a

302
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:34,480
dataset one that you don't know much

303
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,490
about and you want to figure out what

304
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,470
kind of data is in the dataset you can

305
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,110
use clustering to put it into different

306
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:46,959
groups and learn from your data finding

307
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,850
possible partitions is all about finding

308
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,269
how you measure how similar things are

309
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:54,360
and clustering can also be used in

310
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,010
security and other domains of course to

311
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,079
find defined outliers so if you've got

312
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:01,329
for example three groups like this you

313
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:02,709
could say that these two are outliers

314
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,120
which is really useful with anomaly

315
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,199
detection what we look at in Chile now

316
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,899
the last thing is dimensionality

317
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:16,769
reduction and please coming

318
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,970
dimensionality reduction is the process

319
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,560
of reducing the number of random

320
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,570
variables in a dataset so whenever

321
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,750
you've got a let's go back to the dog

322
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,990
example you've got a dataset of dogs and

323
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,130
you've got lots of different features

324
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,449
you might have features that aren't

325
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:33,040
useful for the problem that you're

326
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,709
trying to solve so for example you might

327
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:37,690
have the owner's name and what you're

328
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,149
trying to determine is whether the dog

329
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:41,649
is of a certain breed

330
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,809
future is obviously not really going to

331
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,660
inform your data your machine learning

332
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,939
model whatsoever so you can just get rid

333
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:50,170
of it

334
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,480
so dimensionality reduction is very

335
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,269
useful for excluding or influencing the

336
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:02,619
excluding or reducing the influence of

337
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:04,089
this irrelevant data on your machine

338
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,189
learning model and this is important

339
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:09,629
because of the curse of dimensionality

340
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:11,740
once you have to say like that in your

341
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,839
head every time so machine learning

342
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,329
excels at analyzing data across multiple

343
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:21,670
dimensions humans really struggle to

344
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,709
even think about more than like four or

345
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:28,859
five hi please come in take a seat

346
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,740
however the more dimensions you have and

347
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,649
the more the more space you need to

348
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:38,529
store the data this means that some more

349
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:40,540
dimensions you have the more data you

350
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,220
need to actually make a meaningful

351
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,769
machine learning model so dimensionality

352
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:47,370
reduction is really important because

353
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,569
the datasets that you're going to be

354
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:51,429
working with are usually going to be

355
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:53,889
usually are always going to be finite in

356
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,079
the amount of data you actually have so

357
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,100
if you've got loads and loads of

358
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,629
dimensions all of what you think are

359
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:00,040
useful you're going to need a lot of

360
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:05,740
data to actually solve your problems so

361
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,299
let's talk about machine learning these

362
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:12,099
cases for security one thing I'll

363
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,799
mention here is that machine learning is

364
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,039
not easy there are loads of accessible

365
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,289
libraries and toolkits but we still need

366
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,329
skilled developers that are not only

367
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,069
skilled in machine learning but also in

368
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:26,319
domain knowledge of security whenever

369
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,119
we're trying to solve for securities

370
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,730
cases machine learning and security is

371
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,620
broadly divided into pattern recognition

372
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,950
and anomaly detection they're easy to

373
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,750
conflate but they have different goals

374
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,380
in pattern pattern recognition we try to

375
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,940
detect and I really should have these

376
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,570
there we try to detect characteristics

377
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,270
in data and these characteristics can be

378
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,890
used to teach an algorithm

379
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,170
recognize data that is similar and has

380
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,120
similar characteristics anomaly

381
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,650
detection on the other hand tries to

382
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,500
baseline normal find a statistical

383
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,040
average of the data that is normal and

384
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,900
find deviations from that in order to

385
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,780
inform a model about possibly bad things

386
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,500
happening in security now the list I

387
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,020
have up there ids intrusion detection

388
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,020
systems are a place where we will often

389
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,450
use machine learning for malware

390
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,970
analysis you can always you can often

391
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,920
use machine learning to group malware

392
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,560
and so certain types for spam and

393
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,410
phishing detection you can use a

394
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,780
categorization model to define whether

395
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,460
something is spam or ham or phishing or

396
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,190
not phishing and for domain generation

397
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,690
algorithm generated domain detection

398
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,410
machine learning is also really useful

399
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:48,010
for now and let's take a deep dive into

400
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,620
an anomaly detection for intrusion

401
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,500
detection systems I will mention that a

402
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,710
lot of these examples are taking from

403
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,880
flip right there and I will give you a

404
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:04,990
list of references later on so um what I

405
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,540
want to think about is why you would use

406
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,730
machine learning instead of a heuristic

407
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,610
system and model in the first place so

408
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,540
let's say we're building an IDs and

409
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,210
we've got a bunch of rules that we need

410
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:27,280
to write so let's say we've got a

411
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,890
database and we've got a bunch of users

412
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,690
and they will need to query the database

413
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,150
a certain amount of times per day and we

414
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,250
think that an attacker this is our

415
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,570
threat model will be querying the

416
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,250
database a lot because they want to get

417
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,080
all of the data out of the database and

418
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,120
they don't know how to select start so

419
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,660
let's say we write a rule that says

420
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,550
users will usually query the database 10

421
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,970
times a day and if they query it more

422
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,330
than 10 times that is an anomaly so each

423
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,540
time a user queries the database maybe

424
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,630
we'll run an is anomaly function with

425
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,050
the user ID

426
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:11,040
has the love I don't do software

427
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,580
engineering very well do i with the user

428
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,400
ID is key and will figure out whether

429
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,530
whether the query is an anomaly or

430
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,640
however obviously this makes us ask lots

431
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,160
of questions like how do we set the

432
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,240
threshold is 10 a good number doing

433
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,040
maybe need to use a higher one or a

434
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,290
lower one depending on who the user is

435
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,260
maybe a DB admin would need it more

436
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,690
often than let's say a receptionist and

437
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,750
when do we update the threshold so using

438
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,400
machine learning can actually help us

439
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,530
avoid such questions and let the data

440
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,840
inform us about how to make those

441
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,260
decisions so let's try and come up with

442
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,260
a solution to the threshold problem

443
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,630
maybe instead of 10 we could use an

444
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,450
average so what we'll do is we will

445
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,310
measure the amount of times that users

446
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,760
will query the database each day and we

447
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,670
will divide that average let's say by 24

448
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,640
to get an average per hour and then

449
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,650
we'll multiply that times maybe five

450
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,810
just to account for you know people

451
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,610
using the database differently to play

452
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:29,220
types then once we've got that we still

453
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,230
need to account for certain things like

454
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,360
the roles for example so maybe we need

455
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,410
to say that a data analyst will need to

456
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,330
query the database more times than the

457
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,280
receptionist don't know why I'm picking

458
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,240
on him and then we might need to take

459
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,740
into account things like weekends

460
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,740
holidays etc now although this is still

461
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,260
heuristics you kind of begin to see why

462
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,170
we need machine learning in these

463
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:57,570
situations because this is getting more

464
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,280
and more complex and obviously this is

465
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,560
just one little yeast case and usually

466
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,200
we're dealing with huge systems and you

467
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,360
know big or even small companies where

468
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,790
we need to define these things for lots

469
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,350
and lots of different users and lots of

470
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,620
different situations so you can see that

471
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,840
the the updating of the average would be

472
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,880
this machine learning

473
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,010
but normally detect through the hourly

474
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,150
threshold of Terry would be this

475
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,370
continuous training process that machine

476
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:29,340
learning uses and this machine learning

477
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:34,140
can later use can be triggered by more

478
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,730
complex conditions and I didn't take

479
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,830
into account a lot more variables than

480
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,690
just one also we can talk about for

481
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,640
example not using the average in the

482
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,230
first place we could for example start

483
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,110
using things like the meat because that

484
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:55,140
accounts for outliers essentially so

485
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,090
whenever we're building anomaly

486
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,170
detection systems for an intrusion

487
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:05,160
detection system we need to fulfill

488
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,130
certain objectives now our first and

489
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,350
probably most important objective is

490
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,870
going to be a low false positives and

491
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,470
false negatives now a false positive

492
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:20,280
would be a alert that comes up and say

493
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,530
is this is anomalous when actually it's

494
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,980
fine and it isn't in a false negative

495
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,890
probably a little worse is whenever

496
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,810
something comes through is an anomaly is

497
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,540
malicious and we just don't alert on it

498
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,150
at all now is very difficult to get a

499
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,640
balance of these things because it's

500
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,720
difficult to baseline normal and alerts

501
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,230
could be fired and be false alarms a lot

502
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,420
now if we generate lots and lots of

503
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,730
false positives we could say well at

504
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,990
least we're not having any false

505
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,810
negatives but it deteriorates our trust

506
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,210
in the system and analysts won't take

507
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,130
the alert seriously from a human level

508
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,380
and also the volume of them that we

509
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,660
generate could be so large that we don't

510
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,710
actually ever get to analyze them at all

511
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,120
trust in the system is really really

512
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,730
important in these situations another

513
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,520
objective that we need to account for is

514
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,400
seasonality so adapting to changing

515
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,100
trends in the data so in this situation

516
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,650
of these database sort of of the

517
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,780
database query we need to account for

518
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,190
things like weekend so when you check

519
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,530
out for things like holidays in an IDs

520
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,480
in general you might need to you know

521
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,770
account for tax season or

522
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,800
Patch Tuesday or different things where

523
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,440
there will be anomalous behaviors on the

524
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,180
network as it is if your machine

525
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,310
learning model doesn't account for these

526
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,350
things from the start you are going to

527
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,230
end up with either those false positives

528
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,000
that your analysts won't be able to

529
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,340
triage at all or you're just going to

530
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,620
miss these things entirely and they

531
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,560
could and attackers could use these

532
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,070
kinds of times to hide behind the high

533
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:08,010
traffic volume of data another objective

534
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,440
that we need to solve for is resource

535
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,270
efficiency now this is a little bit of a

536
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:16,820
contentious issue some people think that

537
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,710
latency is the most important thing

538
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,880
whenever you're designing an IDs we know

539
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,460
that data breaches I think on average

540
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,940
take like 10 days to to find on a

541
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,700
network that's it might be an old

542
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,820
statistic I'm not sure but latency is

543
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,350
really important and some machine

544
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,960
learning models are really resource

545
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,810
intensive and can't be done farce fast

546
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,610
so whenever you're choosing your model

547
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,230
you need to make sure that you've got

548
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,760
the right data from the right models so

549
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,940
that you can solve these problems very

550
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,990
fast and the last objective that I'm

551
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,430
going to talk about and obviously you've

552
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,400
got a lot more is the explained ability

553
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,740
of alerts will go into this later on but

554
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,290
at a basic level if you've got a rule

555
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:08,220
like if somebody queries a database 11

556
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,410
times that's an anomaly and that alert

557
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,300
fires is really easy to explain it

558
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,770
however when you've got a machine

559
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,480
learning model and you've got all of

560
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,770
these different algorithms working

561
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,440
together in different ways and an alert

562
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,420
fires an analyst might look at it and

563
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,210
say well I don't know why that's an

564
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,460
anomaly and to optimizing for explain

565
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,990
ability is actually really important

566
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,660
because it also improves on the latency

567
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:36,410
of response if there is an intrusion now

568
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:39,090
whenever we're going to build an anomaly

569
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:44,220
detection system for for an IDs we need

570
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,900
to think about feature engineering so

571
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,580
selecting the right features

572
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,280
is very very important you might find

573
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,530
that your algorithm that you want to use

574
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,950
needs specific types of data so maybe it

575
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,080
needs a time series data or maybe a nice

576
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,700
data of a certain dimension you need to

577
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,170
make sure that you're collecting this

578
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,480
data at the right frequency and the

579
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,110
right way

580
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,000
and in a way that's usable for your

581
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,730
machine learning model your goal here is

582
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,800
to distill really complex information

583
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,610
into a compact form removing unnecessary

584
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:21,480
data so the relevancy of your matrix is

585
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,010
actually really important when you're

586
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,660
building your machine learning model and

587
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,030
you need to take a lot of time to make

588
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,790
sure that once you've got a data set you

589
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,160
clean it up correctly so that you can

590
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,800
build a good model now at this point I

591
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,110
will also mention one other thing which

592
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:43,140
is the difficulty of getting data for

593
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,150
these problems so there are a few data

594
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,890
sets available online that are open

595
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,260
source that you can just download and

596
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,050
work with however I think there's only

597
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,720
kind of one newish one this is

598
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,280
specifically for IDs but for other

599
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,830
security problems as well there's a fee

600
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,630
that are equal to kind of 20 years old

601
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:05,100
from DARPA but in general like you need

602
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,560
to if you're building a machine learning

603
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,240
model to actually work and then the

604
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,580
security environment and let's say some

605
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,040
kind of company or your home network if

606
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,910
you're really paranoid then you need to

607
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,340
work with the data that is actually

608
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,660
going to be available whenever you're

609
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:25,170
using the model so it is kind of an

610
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,420
issue here and a trade-off that if you

611
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,400
want this to be I don't know who

612
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,170
marketed as a start-up consult some

613
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,640
company you will need to get that

614
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,770
company's data and that's usually kind

615
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,080
of difficult to get personally I think

616
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,730
the best way is to go and work for a

617
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,470
company that will let you do this kind

618
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:45,900
of stuff but that's just me so once

619
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,140
you've got your data your features um

620
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,090
you need to do the machine learning and

621
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,180
there is no one-size-fits-all solution

622
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,300
to this you will likely have to

623
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,170
experiment a lot and explore lots of

624
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,790
models to actually select the one that

625
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,130
is going to solve your problem best you

626
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,470
need to account for whether there is

627
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,270
anomalies in your data or not for

628
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:13,050
example if you if there aren't any

629
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,210
anomalies in your data and you know this

630
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,920
your task is actually a little different

631
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,780
what you're going to try and do is

632
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,700
novelty detection so you will be using

633
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,310
models that define normalcy and then

634
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,500
we'll be able to see whenever there is

635
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,290
an anomaly from that if there are

636
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,420
already anomalies in your data and you

637
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,180
know this then you will be doing outlier

638
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,430
detection so you will try and be you

639
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,930
will be trying to look for outliers so

640
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,070
you could for example use these

641
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,260
clustering algorithms and try and find

642
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,170
the outliers on your own you might be in

643
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:45,330
a situation where you don't know if your

644
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,420
data has anomalies or not in which case

645
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,950
you're probably best off just assuming

646
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,330
there are and working from that

647
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,980
assumption and then if you can't find

648
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,950
any you can change but this process is

649
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:59,670
not easy and it will take ages but you

650
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,720
might get there in the end

651
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:06,930
now challenges and anomaly detection the

652
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,970
cost of error in this specific situation

653
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,870
is huge

654
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,080
miss classification of an anomaly can

655
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,470
cause a crippling breach thousands

656
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:22,370
millions of pounds lost for your company

657
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,990
raising false positive alerts all the

658
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,380
time can have a last drastic impact but

659
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,810
could also mean that your analysts will

660
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,550
become fatigued with the amount of

661
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,030
alerts that they are getting and in

662
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,100
general it could degrade again the trust

663
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,080
in your system somebody's alarm clocks

664
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,850
going off that's good please do wake up

665
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,549
[Music]

666
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:55,920
got lost there so it's very important

667
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,150
that you also understand the semantic

668
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,470
gap issue because this is the explained

669
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,000
ability thing that we were talking about

670
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,640
earlier if you build a system that works

671
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,220
really really well but whenever you have

672
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,620
an alert your analyst for the person

673
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,970
that's dealing with it isn't able to

674
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,220
explain why it came about then you're

675
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,460
going to lose firstly a lot of time on

676
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,110
between when the analysts can take the

677
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,330
alerts and figure out why it was an

678
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,460
anomaly and deal with it and secondly

679
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,160
you're you're going to lose resources

680
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,260
and your machine learning model will

681
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,990
need to be updated so that your explain

682
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,700
ability will become better so it's

683
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,480
actually really good to take your model

684
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,880
from the very start and invest in making

685
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,710
sure that the alerts are explainable

686
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,900
even if it takes more resources from the

687
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,080
very start and the one last thing I'll

688
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,430
mention here is the adversarial impact

689
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:59,100
on machine learning so if you've got a

690
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,750
threat actor that is trying to target

691
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,420
your system and your model is operating

692
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,780
in an untrusted environment if they have

693
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,930
seen steez talk who said that you know

694
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,360
the best way to find the holes in a

695
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,520
security in a company's security is to

696
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,790
go on their job specs and if they have

697
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,700
gone to your company's LinkedIn and see

698
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,500
that you're looking for a machine

699
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,210
learning analysts that are very good at

700
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,980
this specific type of anomaly detection

701
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,840
they will know what you're looking for

702
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,850
and they could try and poison the data

703
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,400
in a way that will make your machine

704
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,230
learning models fail so it's always very

705
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,030
important to account for this kind of

706
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,640
thing and I frankly don't really know

707
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,380
how on its off the scope for this talk

708
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,930
so the conclusion for anomaly detection

709
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,700
it's really important for security there

710
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,920
have been successful applications of any

711
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,200
machine learning

712
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,169
before diving into complex algorithms

713
00:32:57,169 --> 00:33:00,019
and trying to figure out which what cool

714
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,269
maths will solve your problem is really

715
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:04,700
important to consider the problem you're

716
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,850
actually trying to solve and you should

717
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,429
be aiming to keep simplicity as one of

718
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:13,789
your kegels whenever you're designing

719
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:18,590
your solution security systems

720
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,679
especially heuristic ones have the

721
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,960
potential to grow uncontrollably to a

722
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,879
scale that is way too big and difficult

723
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,889
to manage with machine learning you're

724
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:29,539
also facing the same issues so it's

725
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:31,070
always really important to make sure you

726
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,600
don't come in everything and understand

727
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,739
why everything is happening so why do we

728
00:33:36,739 --> 00:33:38,960
need machine learning in security in

729
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,590
general and I think some people might

730
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,720
actually not agree with me and might say

731
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,369
that you actually don't need it when

732
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:48,499
security has kind of been working for a

733
00:33:48,499 --> 00:33:51,230
few years without it but in general a

734
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,659
good machine learning performs well in a

735
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:56,179
stochastic environment it can help us

736
00:33:56,179 --> 00:33:58,879
efficiently identify threats it can

737
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:02,419
adapt new behaviors and it is much

738
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:05,330
better than humans at analyzing large

739
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,418
data sets with with new information

740
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:11,119
coming in all the time

741
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,139
let's also address the issue of machine

742
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:17,000
learning replacing replacing human

743
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,668
analysts at all that in general I don't

744
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:24,649
think that this is going to be a problem

745
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:27,199
I think that as we get more machine

746
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,699
learning we're just going to hire more

747
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,940
machine learning developers obviously I

748
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,059
think maybe in a sulk maybe some

749
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:37,399
analysis isn't going to be necessary in

750
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:40,940
the long term however I think that most

751
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,309
of the applications that I've seen

752
00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:45,199
personally and the ones that I've read

753
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,809
about are actually just getting rid of

754
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:50,690
the boring stuff that analysts need to

755
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,109
do so I don't think that it is going to

756
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:55,909
completely replace the security

757
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:59,000
community however you know I might have

758
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,280
to eat my wife one day so um I'm coming

759
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,750
to the end of my talk I think has gone a

760
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,760
lot quicker than I expected

761
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,790
oh well so let's talk about learning

762
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,700
more so the way that I started learning

763
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,520
about this was doing this course here

764
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,240
which is on plural site plural site is I

765
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,580
think you can get one or three months

766
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,040
for free but you do have to pay for it

767
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,520
after that this is not the only course

768
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,930
that's available online there's

769
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,400
absolutely tons

770
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,500
I do recommend doing one if you don't

771
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,420
have the opportunity to go and take one

772
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,010
of these courses at University for

773
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,250
example the machine learning course on

774
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:45,650
Coursera of from Stanford is apparently

775
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,450
the best one ever but they use MATLAB so

776
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,580
I was like no however it is supposed to

777
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,830
be very very good and a lot of the

778
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,540
people that I have worked with have

779
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:00,380
taken this course and have been very

780
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,060
positive about it it's very

781
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,369
comprehensive and explains all of the

782
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:08,840
months scikit-learn is what I used to do

783
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,960
all of my machine learning endeavors it

784
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,000
is fantastic and even just the

785
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,920
documentation for it can teach you a lot

786
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,680
if you are struggling to understand how

787
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,630
some algorithm works just look at the

788
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,060
dots and look at the infant's a little

789
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,700
kind of example that scikit-learn is

790
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,150
going to give you because that like if

791
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,530
you actually understand it line by line

792
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,840
you should be able to figure out why

793
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,690
your thing isn't working

794
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,090
also this aralia book machine learning

795
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,250
and security was really really great and

796
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:43,300
helped to write this talk I have to say

797
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:49,100
so lastly machine learning is really

798
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,980
difficult so if you are trying to learn

799
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,810
it and it's not really working out don't

800
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:54,710
get discouraged

801
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,900
like it does take a long time and

802
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,910
finding some kind of mentor or finding

803
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,740
somebody who can explain things to you I

804
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,320
think is the best way because some of

805
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,730
these problems you can't just keep

806
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,440
bashing your head against you do need to

807
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,850
actually have some kind of insight

808
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,070
especially into the mathematics of how a

809
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,980
problem works so I think is really

810
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,930
important to go to these meetups and

811
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,150
they're not security people if you go to

812
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,250
a machine learning or IAI meetup they're

813
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:19,520
very

814
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,680
different so it's not like this they're

815
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,940
less friendly they all think they're so

816
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:30,860
smart like it is a really good place to

817
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,780
meet people and to talk about things and

818
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,070
if you ask one of them a question they

819
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,630
will go on for hours

820
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,530
no what generalizing or anything yeah so

821
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,630
don't get discouraged if you could take

822
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,180
your phone out right now and I hope this

823
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,030
still works go to fit don't do /hello

824
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,730
survey you could that's how love with

825
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,520
one else you can fill out a little

826
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,140
survey about this talk and I can you

827
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,240
gather your data analyze it was machine

828
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,710
learning so thank you very much for

829
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,230
coming to my talk and I am very happy to

830
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:20,060
take any questions right now okay the

831
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,580
question was that sorry I'm just

832
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,260
repeating it for the microphone that

833
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,030
machine learning just teach you a lot

834
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,780
but yeah I absolutely agree

835
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:34,130
I was curious I mean when you've done as

836
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,150
she'll already have you done it for

837
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:39,950
industry or so the question is whether I

838
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,780
did machine learning for industry or

839
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,730
academically so I'm currently on

840
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,030
placement in a bank and one of my

841
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,010
projects that I undertook during my

842
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,200
placement was a kind of proof-of-concept

843
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,840
machine learning project which I'm not

844
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,100
really allowed to go into detail about

845
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:03,800
because if you if you started like from

846
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,350
the kid likes so I keep learns and stuff

847
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,920
like that or did you consider any kind

848
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,000
of existing products out there that

849
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,330
package the machine learning decided

850
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,330
okay so I can't so for me personally I

851
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,520
was giving the project from kind of a

852
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,230
higher level so I can really get to

853
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:28,010
choose I can't comment on what happens

854
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,740
in the company I work for

855
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,369
however in Jen

856
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:36,410
in industry I have definitely seen a lot

857
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:38,900
of criticism of different kind of

858
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,589
machine learning security products and

859
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:45,470
kind of the approach that I've seen has

860
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,619
been that they because they need so much

861
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,990
fine tuning and because they tend a big

862
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,900
company is so different across different

863
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,759
companies you might actually find that

864
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:57,470
they don't work very well but that's

865
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,599
just talking to a few people die isn't a

866
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,690
representative dataset whatsoever so you

867
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,279
know I wouldn't I wouldn't take this at

868
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:08,089
face value as machine learners you have

869
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:09,890
patience absolutely she's learning the

870
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,720
way like I don't like dark trees like

871
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:18,380
they're like my di crap there's a lot

872
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,509
like your board on the street available

873
00:40:20,509 --> 00:40:22,220
that actually there wasn't a machine

874
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,259
learning Rai it was just standard

875
00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:26,240
signature-based crap and then Vicky's

876
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,339
market it's like how much of it is

877
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:30,980
actually yeah

878
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:36,910
so I'll go back to where is it this like

879
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:40,880
so okay I wouldn't comment on any

880
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,160
specific products although

881
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:48,380
dark-dark trace does have a very a very

882
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,150
interesting talk on YouTube that you can

883
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,269
watch from there you know machine

884
00:40:53,269 --> 00:40:55,339
learning experts that explains a little

885
00:40:55,339 --> 00:40:57,109
bit about what happens in the black box

886
00:40:57,109 --> 00:41:01,369
I think that there are you know machine

887
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:04,670
learning is like a regression problem

888
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,329
right that is machine learning if you

889
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:10,789
apply it in the right way so I think a

890
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:12,739
lot of these things are just predicting

891
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:14,059
something is going to happen in the

892
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:15,259
future and you could think well that's a

893
00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:17,210
bit simplistic but you know if you look

894
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,549
at the definition of machine learning is

895
00:41:19,549 --> 00:41:21,920
like the foot solution that they're

896
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,180
using I don't think I can really comment

897
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,710
in general I think there's definitely

898
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,779
places that employ machine learning

899
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,329
experts and do use machine learning

900
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:38,930
models but I think in general I'm not

901
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,880
sure what the law is on both advertising

902
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,170
I don't know if you're allowed to say

903
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,180
they use machine learning

904
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,730
if you don't that but then again I don't

905
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:48,440
think that the lawmakers could ever

906
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,820
really check because they don't know

907
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,579
enough so I don't know it's a good

908
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:54,200
question I'm not sure how to answer it

909
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,170
you can sleep the illness

910
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:02,720
any other questions with seeing none and

911
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,640
that's the end of my talk thank you so

912
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,790
much
