1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,520
okay so hey everyone for those that

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,340
don't know me I'm already or even those

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,600
that do because you have to listen

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,869
anyway and news Becca Becca would not

5
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:15,420
like the shop little leak you know on

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,400
the slate it's crazy how many people

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,610
confuse that yeah I'm a student in my

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,460
final year studies at the University of

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,550
Glasgow doing science so basically right

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,140
now I'm just procrastinating some of

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,750
dissertations due on Wednesday but it's

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,000
all good it's all good

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,050
anyway this talks a bit of a different

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,630
one I'm asking the questions why our

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,840
user is a star star star at security

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,050
also known as why our user shittest

17
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,840
curia answers questions being asked

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,210
about a million times I'm gonna look at

19
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,130
the actual reasoning behind it and like

20
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,399
sir why they are instead of just

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,710
you know asking no one by just showing

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,630
it like into the void when I'm pissed

23
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,320
off before we get started a quick

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,120
disclaimer to say that although I study

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,319
at the University of Glasgow none of

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,420
this presentation is endorsed by and/or

27
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,619
part of their work it's all stuff I'm

28
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,439
doing individually and it will almost

29
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,859
definitely remain that way and that's

30
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:16,880
that's fine and also as you can tell and

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,049
could be swearing a wee bit in this so

32
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,389
yeah sorry if you're offended by that

33
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:23,759
and I'll be offended if you're offended

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,399
so it's just not be offended together

35
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:29,100
yeah go and also a lot of stuff I'm

36
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,749
gonna say here is opinion law is fact

37
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:33,060
and I'll try and make obvious when

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,279
someone is actually a fact but um

39
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:38,039
overall we'll just take everything I say

40
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:42,299
is me spoken shape so yeah let's just

41
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,689
get started anyway so let's just start

42
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,569
by some common reasons why people think

43
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:51,569
that users are shipped and naturally I

44
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,700
bet like half a year sudden going come

45
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,899
on she needs to mention that she needs

46
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,969
mention this thing and I don't blame you

47
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,979
we do have a lot of reasons why we think

48
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,880
this first we have fairly obvious one

49
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,859
passwords like ya have to have to talk

50
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,799
about this it's just you know it's bad

51
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,130
don't get me wrong a lot of users are

52
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,060
really good at making passwords you know

53
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,960
long

54
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,490
complex passwords lots of weird s

55
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,830
symbols variations of carps Laura these

56
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,100
characters of that and but that does

57
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,010
depend on what you would define a lot as

58
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,800
a lot of users could mean a hundred to

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,940
you you know that maybe a lot of people

60
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,890
and but overall and to be frank they're

61
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,570
absolutely and passwords like

62
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,330
there's no other way to put it like who

63
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,790
the told users there was a great

64
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,410
idea it's based all other passwords

65
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,650
their most important ship on the point

66
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,050
iron that they were born in with their

67
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,020
their date of birth or just their years

68
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,280
birth even em or like the first pet who

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,840
they upload for it was off on in scrum

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,760
every day with their name all

71
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,080
information about meat you need to gain

72
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,690
the passwords and why so many parents

73
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,900
out there kids and first appearance with

74
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,600
these these things leaking because over

75
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,190
oh you're just setting your kid up to be

76
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,720
Billy the earth there and because

77
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,280
they're batters get leaked you know you

78
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,670
don't want your kid to have to grow up

79
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,920
with all of their messages to their best

80
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,630
friend when they were 12 years old being

81
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,700
public publicly available in the

82
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,010
internet it's just as bad as when people

83
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,060
name their kids

84
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,650
Iona when their last name is crispy

85
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,890
users tend to be useless I mean

86
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,900
let's just take a quick reminder and

87
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,760
look at the most common password trading

88
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,010
I'm sure a lot you have already this is

89
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,599
just a quick refresher if you see that

90
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,989
the past like 12 years it's exactly the

91
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:53,920
 same nobody learns and even

92
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,750
when people have had passwords on the

93
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,340
most common passwords list four years

94
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,480
running they're still using the same

95
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,819
ones and at least they do have the

96
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:01,840
argument that they're not going to

97
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,950
forget it's all they need to do is

98
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,930
Google most common passwords and um

99
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,220
what's though you think you know

100
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,040
especially number one taking the person

101
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,470
yeah that's that's just one reason next

102
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,139
we have privacy sentence oh yeah so you

103
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:21,548
know that some people actually don't

104
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:24,070
know these things exist like I shut you

105
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,290
not the other day someone genuinely said

106
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,660
to me how come I can't see your friends

107
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,570
list on Facebook even though I am in

108
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,330
fact friends with you oh you can change

109
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,090
that really I was like yeah you can if

110
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,500
you actually looked at your settings

111
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,720
like ever just to glance that you and

112
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,950
privacy settings really aren't helped by

113
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,740
some people are in my age and older

114
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,880
people do it as well but it's more

115
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,160
popular now and being so obsessed with

116
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,960
getting the most lakes or the motor

117
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,520
retweets or the most shares of their

118
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,890
posts so they just point-blank refused

119
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,200
to put and to make the things private

120
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,910
cuz otherwise people can retweet their

121
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,580
tweets and and if that's what's most

122
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,860
important someone compared to you know

123
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,789
actually having privacy then you know if

124
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:10,990
they're really wanting that that

125
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,160
Instagram theme and that famous

126
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,840
lifestyle then people could potentially

127
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,150
just get your address and turn up at

128
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,289
your house and then you have like that

129
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:19,539
priests soccer fan thing going on so

130
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:22,060
that's what you want that's Fame and

131
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,669
then yeah there are lots of articles

132
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,080
being published that I've seen really

133
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,550
recently they've always kind of been

134
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,470
being published by am specifically

135
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,550
starring in Facebook Google and

136
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,919
Instagram and like with some article

137
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:34,479
published last week by Consumer Reports

138
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,280
which is about how to use Facebook

139
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,560
privacy sentence and like I said they've

140
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,150
also got similar ones published her in

141
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,060
the same time and but Google and

142
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,039
Instagram articles like this are

143
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,110
genuinely written with the aim just

144
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,750
trying to help people and walk them

145
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,159
through how to change their per sentence

146
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,819
to make things a little more secure but

147
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:56,620
let's be honest some users won't even

148
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,229
see them and then when people do see

149
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:00,729
them they would just be like guys I

150
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:03,879
don't need to do that once man so this

151
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:06,099
leads me on to my next point where we

152
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,689
have the I of nothing to hate anyway

153
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:10,110
users the guess is suspicious and

154
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,389
whenever your accounts on private and

155
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:14,889
automatically think you're a drug dealer

156
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:17,530
or and a lot worse that was just the

157
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,520
safest thing I could say what a dark and

158
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,400
hidden secret and so for example I

159
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,500
recreated my Facebook account about a

160
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,659
year or two ago just for gdpr kicked on

161
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:32,139
and obviously this was just the start of

162
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:34,419
Facebook's issues with privacy but um

163
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:38,319
well master people and yeah so when your

164
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,870
facebook data and when you delete

165
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,370
something from Facebook they still kept

166
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,150
it because why wouldn't they and if

167
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,680
anyone remembers that so the amount of

168
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,389
people would have messaged me after gdpr

169
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:52,590
hit and I could recreate my Facebook and

170
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,310
you know I was getting phone calls

171
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,840
asking if I'd been hacked

172
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,740
you know if someone was trying to

173
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,300
personate me and I said no it's just me

174
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,449
making a new Facebook company and and if

175
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:03,219
I was so weird I made a new one and

176
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:05,430
especially my family we were just like

177
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,839
what were you saying when you relate 12

178
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,159
that was so bad that you didn't want a

179
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:10,779
private company to have it it's like oh

180
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:13,419
I just wanted some privacy there's

181
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:16,300
nothing wrong with that and you should

182
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,389
want some as well I mean even though

183
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:21,039
people say that they have love and hate

184
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,900
all the same they complain so much about

185
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,409
and say if the FBI came to me you know

186
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:28,900
what it's to go in their places and they

187
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,099
say that they want unlock their phone

188
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:32,529
for anyone I can assure these people

189
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:34,930
that if everything they had ever

190
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,190
received or ever sent or anything at all

191
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,229
from all of their technical devices was

192
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:43,449
just published online and they would

193
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:47,379
quickly regret so yeah that's the most

194
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:49,690
infuriating infuriating reasons I

195
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,789
personally have for Finken users or

196
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:54,550
shares curate their course hundreds more

197
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,740
and thousands even that people could

198
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,330
think up and I'm sure that your own

199
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,560
personal list would be very different

200
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,430
from mine so

201
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,180
and moving on we actually have reasons

202
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,410
why users think we're and as

203
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,200
Richard as rich as is and users think

204
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,820
we're sometimes it's security to is

205
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,060
can ironic and but you know it's it's

206
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,980
good suka and feedback and so on and

207
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,350
Chris criticisms so for the record this

208
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,780
is just looking at we mmm as like

209
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,390
security analysts experts enthusiasts

210
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,800
whatever you want call us whenever I

211
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,990
reference we it's like community I guess

212
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,309
um so yeah here we go

213
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:36,130
so firstly we have this mistrust that

214
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,590
seems to be baked into us and ingrained

215
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,929
and everything that we do I'm sure that

216
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,190
sometimes is a good thing and it's no

217
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,040
wonder like obviously we know how easy

218
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,680
it is and as you seen in you know this

219
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,390
morning like to get people to hand over

220
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,140
their details and so on um that means

221
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,820
that we would fall for fishing a knows

222
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,550
we're HMRC are trying to give you money

223
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,650
and like be realistic if you ever are

224
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,450
you know owed money from him are see

225
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,220
they're gonna avoid trying to contact

226
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:06,630
you

227
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,220
[Applause]

228
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,420
but anyway so it does get pretty

229
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,640
irritating for the average user

230
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,960
somethings example something that I

231
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,980
actually done myself and when I can had

232
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,840
this big security can realize secure a

233
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,090
was important and was I've got a new

234
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,190
phone and I made my network settings and

235
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,770
configurations of the network driver on

236
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,260
my new phone so tightly configured I

237
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,530
could only connect to one Wi-Fi network

238
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,900
being a drill

239
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,540
if anyone's student or again is enough

240
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,610
Demian had to use edge room for I'm

241
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,970
sorry and because it's painful

242
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,420
especially like at peak times so um I

243
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,700
had to downloads I think was like a

244
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,130
hundred megabyte file to can sexless and

245
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,650
it took me three hours because said room

246
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,310
it's it's bad so when you know I've told

247
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,570
people about this they're just going to

248
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,090
laugh at me I'm like come on which yes

249
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,930
pin upon it in your stupid book and

250
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,080
another example is I have um a friend

251
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,610
that tries to be like is off the grid as

252
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,680
possible at all time for security

253
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,840
purposes is you know it's fair

254
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,630
no fair point but when you try and reach

255
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,460
them the quickest way to get a response

256
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,760
is email and because they tried to avoid

257
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,900
taking their phone with them wherever

258
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,460
they go and because they try to avoid

259
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,510
taking it with them wherever they go

260
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,470
they don't really use it and so can be

261
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,170
quite am quite irritating obviously they

262
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,750
have no social network profiles are no

263
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,220
instant messaging service either like

264
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,020
what cipher telegram or anything like

265
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,760
that because I you know all the

266
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,320
organizations are spying on his after

267
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,510
all so then we have the constant secrecy

268
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,850
and again this can mostly be a good

269
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,420
thing you know it genuinely and it's

270
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,830
good to not publish everything about

271
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,750
yourself online sometimes for obvious

272
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,240
reasons and but it can't get in the way

273
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,520
for example when a baron made to meet

274
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,040
the next example and when I was very

275
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,590
sleep-deprived

276
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:09,670
so if you were to message someone asking

277
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,310
for and their address it's cool here you

278
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,200
know your mates got gaff if you want to

279
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,590
both - it's fine em and they said but

280
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,150
instead of just sending you a message

281
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,970
and with their address then they would

282
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,640
send stupid - carrier pigeon that they

283
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,710
have for you that we'd meet them by the

284
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,870
fir-tree in the part of the place that

285
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,840
you live in and within 10 minutes to

286
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,250
give them it because you don't trust the

287
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,870
communication channel that you're missed

288
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,510
you know it's a bit ridiculous obviously

289
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,790
this is a bit of a far-fetched example

290
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,010
but honestly it wouldn't surprise me

291
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,730
that much anymore and because yeah it's

292
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,230
the lens some people go through to

293
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,680
protect their personal information and

294
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,360
it's fair but be realistic and oh yeah

295
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,980
honestly know is all you can really tell

296
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,390
the images I made to compare it to the

297
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,250
ones that go online it's probably not

298
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,090
for the best and then there's this like

299
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:09,220
Hawker magnitude most people that are

300
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,930
good at technical security and pen

301
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,660
testing and so on and even if they're

302
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,630
not to be honest it snowed it and

303
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,380
constantly hold it over people's heads

304
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,900
and it's not just security enthusiasts

305
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,510
ergo if this and bet there's a ton of

306
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,920
people in their lifetime that have

307
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,320
probably been told by someone that does

308
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,790
some pain in martial arts

309
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,040
by are you if they really wanted to so

310
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,240
you should watch yourself that's like

311
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,170
all right Jesus I that's fine hard man

312
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,030
but obviously there's just really no

313
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,890
point to it especially when situation

314
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,880
just doesn't call for it and you know de

315
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,550
obviously it can't be a laugh and a joke

316
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,010
but please stop saying you can have

317
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,100
people just because just as funny and

318
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,090
especially not if they just beat you a

319
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,220
game and cards and even if you are one

320
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,050
of the few people that make that claim

321
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,300
that can actually have someone as

322
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,950
beautifully illustrated by this mean

323
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,580
that's not the point and point is mrs.

324
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,240
Luke came to Shay when we did so moving

325
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,370
on have the constant assumptions that we

326
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,020
make that users are stupid and we're so

327
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,770
much Berenson

328
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,340
I mean some things is justified and but

329
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,630
most of the same it's just pre-written

330
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,670
free users especially if this is done

331
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,040
when a user is asking you specifically

332
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,610
for help or advice for something

333
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,950
explaining something to someone like

334
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,140
they're five years old isn't gonna make

335
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,210
them feel good about the answer you just

336
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,130
give them it's just gonna make them feel

337
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,980
stupid and small it's important

338
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,420
sometimes remember that everyone needs

339
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,100
to learn and if someone's coming to you

340
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,920
for advice or asking you about security

341
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,760
sad or something like that

342
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,710
don't be a dick about it because they

343
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,050
genuinely are trying to draw something

344
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,360
from you it's it's a compliment really

345
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,050
and it will probably just make them

346
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,900
regress further into the realm of no

347
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,000
security if you do make them feel bad

348
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,750
about it as well

349
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,160
because I'll just probably think they

350
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,130
can do it themselves and they can some

351
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,260
things but sometimes sometimes they're

352
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,750
you know so those are the top reasons

353
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,750
from both my personal opinion and some

354
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,490
people actually can informally surveys

355
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,260
and write the way that they've seen

356
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,300
security people interact with them hand

357
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,060
with each other and so again there are

358
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,860
tons more things that users could add to

359
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,600
this list oh we are I'm sure they

360
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,820
would be more than happy to but not

361
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,480
Landon get any more space so in reality

362
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,420
we're both not completely wrong and we

363
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,360
can both be and users can you ship

364
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,750
a lot we can be sure a lot and we can

365
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,640
both be great sometimes too

366
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,500
there there are some important

367
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,399
suggestions that I want to make and as

368
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,350
you know so that we as security Polk and

369
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,200
users as non-security book can help each

370
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,970
other out and just be less will

371
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,300
grow and especially we have the

372
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,089
need-to-know principle and this is

373
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:02,649
pointed out by a deep DB Parker and it's

374
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:05,110
adopted from a military assumption that

375
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,750
was made and done by a range of

376
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,240
psychology studies and and it's

377
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,329
basically summed up by the more that we

378
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,180
know about a security mechanism and the

379
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,720
easier is that sac M which isn't isn't

380
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,329
wrong and such but they're flipping that

381
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:26,230
round sort of saw that and the less that

382
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,810
users know about something then the

383
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,329
secured the the more secure is for them

384
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:35,079
because you know people just think of

385
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:37,209
them as an inherently insecure which

386
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:39,550
isn't entirely true and they've actually

387
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,130
been studies done on this and which I

388
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,300
can Freight links to and they're and

389
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,800
they show that when users don't know

390
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,839
about things like password procedures

391
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,970
and how easy their passwords are broken

392
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,470
and how insecure they are and you know

393
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,910
how quickly you can brief or sit in a

394
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,100
Mario seconds and their security as much

395
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,740
we hear them when they do so as a result

396
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,209
we can see that the opposite of what

397
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:03,519
kind of a lot of companies and a lot of

398
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,649
people are currently doing and it's

399
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:07,690
actually what should be done the more

400
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,579
that users are told about risks their

401
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:12,160
security and how easy it is to break the

402
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,810
better they are actually implement and

403
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,820
security settings well and we can have

404
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,110
we can actually help them off this as

405
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,380
well I just telling them in a nice way

406
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,010
that they're bad is security and you

407
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,630
know and why security should be

408
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,100
important to them and it depend on

409
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,250
circumstances so for example even if you

410
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,990
can't get people to engine remained

411
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,820
about implement and stronger passwords

412
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,890
at least let them know about sites like

413
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,680
how secure is my passwords and which is

414
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,140
bash Lane site and how they be important

415
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,390
so they can at least get some indication

416
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,620
of if they're doing a good job but their

417
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,230
passwords are not obviously make sure

418
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,630
that and you know these sites are the

419
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,699
actual correct URLs they're going to so

420
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:52,840
they're just being fished

421
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,820
and an attempt to better securities oh

422
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,220
and if they're actually keen on

423
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,930
listening to you and more maybe

424
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,550
recommend them to just install password

425
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,020
managers and letting know that they

426
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,060
never have to forget another password

427
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,990
again absolutely so all this boy was

428
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,000
tired to the notion of perceived threats

429
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,730
so in any situation not just insecurity

430
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,160
and you're more likely to be more

431
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,050
careless and do your regular thing if

432
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,130
you don't think there's any frets in

433
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,800
both what you're doing for example if

434
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,270
you find out the person sitting next to

435
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,420
you right now was trying to M plot steal

436
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,050
your phone

437
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,630
and during this meet giving this talk

438
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,640
and you might hold out a little bit more

439
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,040
closely to you and or you may just shift

440
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,360
further away from them or you might just

441
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,100
be more aware of their presence like you

442
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,930
probably are right now so just mention

443
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:43,780
it so yeah and if users don't think that

444
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,820
something is a security threat and or

445
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,530
something that can be exploited and

446
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,840
against them then they're probably not

447
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,550
gonna do anything to make it more secure

448
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,890
and because that just takes more effort

449
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,130
from them right not like I said I'm not

450
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,420
just talking about technical security

451
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,390
and if some people saw how easily that

452
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,740
some of the people in this room could

453
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,510
probably take a lot to their front door

454
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,250
and they'd probably run out and get like

455
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,080
a new door and twenty five different

456
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,200
alarm systems and so on as well this

457
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,250
leads on to the importance of

458
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,050
communication and transparency between

459
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,170
users and security folk like us we want

460
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,400
users to stop causing us so much grief

461
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,250
and if users want to stop pausing if

462
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,929
users want to self cause an end so much

463
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:24,910
great and we should really just talk to

464
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,800
each other a bit security more openly

465
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,230
you can go out and tell someone that you

466
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,220
could probably guess their password

467
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,440
within five minutes or five tries Eden

468
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,990
and it's not always a bad thing and just

469
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,820
can't gauge the situation though you

470
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,960
know you don't want to be doing that you

471
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,000
know if someone's just had a really hard

472
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,020
day and maybe a bit annoying and or you

473
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,760
can go over and ask someone the security

474
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,679
question to their online banking account

475
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,940
and see how quickly they tell you the

476
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,650
right answer so that you can just be

477
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,970
like alright well no I could you know

478
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,400
get all your buying pieces fence and

479
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,080
then Ralph before they got you so and

480
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,480
but make users around you aware that

481
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,010
it's okay for them to ask questions of

482
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,929
history and it may actually lead to them

483
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:03,250
thinking more about it

484
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,140
and thinking better but others of

485
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,799
community a lot you may be sitting there

486
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,960
thinking well why you should it be my

487
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,669
job to go out and tell users that they

488
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:14,710
should be more secure it's just no fun I

489
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,030
don't want to be that person I want to

490
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,230
see them suffer to that I say if you

491
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,330
understood the irritation iPods and the

492
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,490
reason that this users our shared

493
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,980
security part of this talk and you don't

494
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,450
want to do something about it then and

495
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,740
you probably just want to watch the

496
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:37,179
world burn and thanks each their own so

497
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:40,720
lastly some takeaways broke some

498
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,940
aspects of security as our users some

499
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,480
more than others

500
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,520
and what we should try and speak to them

501
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,230
about their security but making them

502
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,940
feel small or they the kind come to us

503
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,140
for advice when they need it

504
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,590
it's important that you know if we want

505
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,000
to make the most common password list

506
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,130
for next year a little bit and less

507
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,870
similar as it has been previously then

508
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,860
we all need to take part to play in it

509
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,210
secondly don't ask people it's go meet

510
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,500
your carrier pigeons in the park and

511
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,480
instead of just messaging them and some

512
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,510
things we need to apply and we don't

513
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,710
need to apply the same level of security

514
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,740
to everything that we do and think is

515
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,559
you know it's situational and it's okay

516
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:20,380
that you know some things you text

517
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,120
message asking what time fetters it's

518
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,289
going to be read by someone that's fine

519
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,350
let's not do that

520
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,909
so thank you all very much for coming

521
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:29,289
along and listen really appreciate it

522
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:31,030
and I think I've got time for some

523
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,450
questions

524
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,010
questions

525
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:54,000
yep what do you think I think that an

526
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,800
effort should be made I mean I'm from a

527
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,190
software engineering like background ish

528
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,350
thanks it's fine no my unit my uni like

529
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,820
specializes in software engineering

530
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,570
and basically I think it's just bad it's

531
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,510
baked in from the start like we for

532
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,920
instance we have to do one security

533
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,540
course it's compulsory and that's it and

534
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,070
it's just like this is encryption and

535
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,210
I'm like and you're gonna send these

536
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,290
people and they're gonna be fully

537
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,660
fleshed off for engineers like a vanilla

538
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,760
and so yeah they should be taught more

539
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,290
about security it shouldn't just be up

540
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,580
to security people what's going to fix

541
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,750
their mistakes especially when the

542
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,220
software engineering team is like 20

543
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,280
times size of the security team and

544
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,500
something that is hopefully gonna be

545
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,300
changed and there is the common more of

546
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,830
an emphasis on security companies are

547
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,020
doubling the sizes of all their security

548
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,060
teams which I kept keep getting told it

549
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,330
graduate events so we're tripling your

550
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:53,870
security and like great cool thanks yeah

551
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,490
yep think we'll still have all these

552
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:06,810
problems 30 years hopefully not but like

553
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,610
I said there's like influencers and

554
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,500
stuff on Instagram and like fitness

555
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,120
models and stuff they're just like I'm

556
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,670
not gonna make anything private because

557
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,600
people aren't gonna see my posts and

558
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,220
that's become a much more of push in

559
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,620
this generation and a lot more people do

560
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,230
that and try to make money off of it and

561
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,790
once iesson so I think some I would like

562
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,020
to see people are gonna be more aware of

563
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,180
it but whether people were gonna care

564
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,810
about it I guess we I can have a part to

565
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,490
play in the psychos sans well

566
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,859
[Music]

567
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:54,250
well I get yeah it's it's the same thing

568
00:22:54,250 --> 00:23:00,220
like sometimes people and don't think

569
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,720
things like this some people sometimes

570
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:09,399
we want the view that I have good

571
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:11,200
reasons to take people's real identities

572
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,610
when you're at an event where people get

573
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:24,070
Harris personally I would say that and

574
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,629
it would be better if people you know

575
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:27,820
the event organizers to curiyo names and

576
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,769
stuff and then and give you the option

577
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:31,570
of you know what you want displayed on

578
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:35,908
your card okay that's the best way to do

579
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,210
[Music]

580
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,259
you know we're at conference right now

581
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:54,190
any other questions feel free one of the

582
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,860
things that you would want users to know

583
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,710
if you could just like get hold of them

584
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,850
and say do this

585
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,679
what like you mean better grabbing them

586
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:08,440
and shaking like that purposely sentence

587
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,009
existence and that their passwords are

588
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:15,429
probably already online and changing one

589
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:18,039
digit or making it the next year alone

590
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,529
isn't gonna make it more secure and

591
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:21,639
since so many people out that

592
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:25,269
misconception and yeah and just really

593
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:29,230
how you know there's probably a map

594
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,090
somewhere and online even if it's

595
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,159
private to them and off like everywhere

596
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:36,370
they've been at some point where it

597
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,110
tracks you make in the background let's

598
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,750
say people don't know that unless they

599
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,330
like look into a lot of things so maybe

600
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,559
just gonna make me more aware of this

601
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:51,149
event say you have that conversation

602
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:54,730
privacy sentence exist I would do I by

603
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,050
somebody to decide

604
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,760
was private in on Sadie's Donna

605
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,540
influencer not a super private person in

606
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,090
society how do they make the decision of

607
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,030
what to do it not to do people I would

608
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,760
say just think of everything is like if

609
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,770
your princess if I just like shout out

610
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,690
information to everyone in this room or

611
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,910
they just put up online what would you

612
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,200
want people to know and what things

613
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,370
would you can't be like I don't really

614
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,500
want people to know that and can it to

615
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,140
say based on that what you don't have to

616
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,300
make as secure as and then if it's a

617
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,280
site-wide thing and like for example

618
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,990
people want private messages to remain

619
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,150
private and some information they don't

620
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,140
really care about and just sort of

621
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,450
implement as much here as you see fit

622
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:41,650
em and then obviously hopefully that

623
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,880
will be to that asking you what do you

624
00:25:42,880 --> 00:26:01,260
see didn't expect that question today

625
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:07,330
but no I would say that and I would say

626
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,180
that what do you mean by unsafe of

627
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,290
something if something is it possible

628
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:25,150
yeah I would say that it depends on what

629
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,460
you pin in your passwords and friends

630
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,020
likely you've got that website that I

631
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,140
had up and I guess my password safe or

632
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,430
something it tells you how many years if

633
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,840
it takes crack your password how many

634
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,450
minutes even sometimes and I'm based on

635
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,470
that and you can you know obviously if

636
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,310
you're using words from the dictionary

637
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,580
and stuff it like fits it down and we're

638
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,110
using random characters and stuff with

639
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,970
boots on and you could have a way

640
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,760
shorter character with symbols and and a

641
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,600
ton of stuff like that

642
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,800
and it would be more secure than a

643
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,480
really really long password that's just

644
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,750
like the first line of us all so it

645
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,540
depends length isn't so

646
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,780
users a lot you know like insecurity do

647
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,330
you think that actually because in

648
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,420
nowadays everyone has a more powerful

649
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,630
kids nowadays are more powerful

650
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,720
should we actually promote awareness

651
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,100
already in school oh yeah definitely

652
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,390
yeah I think that you know the earlier

653
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,100
that people have these spaces I think

654
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,100
you should be teaching it from then um

655
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,049
it's like it's like the previous comment

656
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:40,390
like you can't just train someone how to

657
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,100
be a software engineer and not make them

658
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,960
learn steer you can start like it

659
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,580
doesn't work like but um because

660
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,470
otherwise they're still gonna be in the

661
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,390
software engineer mindset and seriously

662
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,309
be a nasty crop we're security issues

663
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:53,080
like sort of come as a fault with these

664
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,200
spaces should be like okay and first

665
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,580
thing I do what's the password gonna be

666
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,710
okay well how secure do anything is

667
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:06,220
possible so on and I just one more

668
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:06,940
question

669
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,570
with two-factor authentication becoming

670
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:15,490
more prominent maybe more for us general

671
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:18,940
users do you think that eventually bad

672
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,340
passwords will be a much smaller problem

673
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,010
than it is it depends on how the

674
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,660
two-factor authentication has been done

675
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,419
for example Google has like their finger

676
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:29,679
you just cannot unlock your phone and

677
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,600
click yes and then much number on screen

678
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,970
but if you don't have your phone or if

679
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,080
you're logging in from a different

680
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,700
browser or something or your security

681
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,410
settings are quite tight which should

682
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,559
assume most room will have them and it

683
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:43,720
often doesn't let you do that and it has

684
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,830
to input your password

685
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,440
so if passwords are so an option as a

686
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,299
sort of identification mechanism then

687
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:53,520
they still need to be just as secure

688
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,830
okay well I thank very much for coming

689
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,010
over
