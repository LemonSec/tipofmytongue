instrument to master this wonderful

percussive instrument has many

16
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,489
intricacies but you'll find it's easy to

17
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:45,500
learn the first thing to learn is the

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,870
proper way to hold the cowbell to start

19
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,480
with here are two examples of how not to

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,430
hold the cowbell hold your hand is shown

21
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,710
here now make a claw with your hand like

22
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,690
so think of an eagle's claw that's it

23
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,850
now simply insert the shallow end of the

24
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,059
cowbell into position and squeeze give a

25
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:07,039
few rough taps to make sure the cowbell

26
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:09,020
is secure are you still holding the

27
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,479
cowbell you've done it you can now

28
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:13,610
properly hold a cowbell there are a

29
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,170
number of positions you can play the

30
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,050
cowbell this is called seated position

31
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,670
it's popular because it provides

32
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,830
adequate spinal support for the cowbell

33
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,660
player some players prefer standing

34
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,479
position prone position is a somewhat

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,160
unorthodox position favored by Germans

36
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,080
this position which is very popular

37
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,880
these days is known as bridge

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,640
Dickinson's position find a position

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,709
that's most comfortable for you and will

40
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:42,410
begin playing first you must find due

41
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,599
north with a compass modern science has

42
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,550
proven that a cowbell sounds its best

43
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,069
when facing due north if you're facing

44
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:51,259
another direction you may notice a

45
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:53,239
significant drop-off in quality of the

46
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,710
cowbell sound

47
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:01,130
a drumstick usually made of wood is used

48
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,869
to strike the cowbell but you can

49
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:06,700
explore other items to strike a cowbell

50
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,530
we however recommend starting with a

51
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,120
normal drumstick let's begin playing

52
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,860
we'll start out with a very recognizable

53
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,290
piece of music note where the player

54
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,920
chooses to add the cowbell

55
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,489
[Music]

56
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,150
there see how riveting the cowbell can

57
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,610
be it adds that little extra bit of

58
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,620
magic to any music let's try a different

59
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,950
melody this time modern music here is

60
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,170
the song without the prison's of cowbell

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,970
and now with the cowbell be sure to play

62
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,720
along at home

63
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:11,840

it said you can learn about a lot about

68
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,340
someone by walking a mile in his shoes

69
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,129
the same is true for a cowbell except a

70
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:25,739
cowbell has no shoes or feet so simply

71
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,110
learn by walking a mile and playing your

72
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,819
cowbell soon you'll have found that you

73

00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,520
we do something like that and just

168
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,979
randomly accuse intercept professionals

169
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,630
have completely made-up malware from

170
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,299
completely made-up apt groups and so if

171
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,890
you follow the bear farmers you'll see a

172
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,799
few times a day on automated accusation

173
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,929
sent out to a member of the information

174
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,210
security community accusing them of

175
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:49,320
being a bad actor well it wasn't I don't

176
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,580
think they got offended I think they

177
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,670
thought it was real and so we have to

178
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,930
fine-tune it a little bit and we've

179
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,280
hashed out it with just for fun because

180
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,280
it's just fun right so if you do see

181
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,060
your name appear on the bear farmers

182
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,410
Twitter it's not real unless it's it is

183
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:12,260
real in which case we busted you okay

184
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,020
okay

185
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,150
just a quick look at that there so I

186
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,600
lifted this I looked at that quote from

187
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,970
Mark Zuckerberg saying privacy is a

188
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,110
social norm of the past and all right

189
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,150
well according to Facebook yeah I think

190
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,340
it seems to be now we like Facebook

191
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,160
because they are really a gift that

192
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,540
keeps on giving from an information

193
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,060
security point of view and we talk about

194
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,570
them a lot

195
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,130
all the bear farm stocks that we've done

196
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,360
have had either a small or a large

197
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,620
section on Facebook

198
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,770
and we work closely with studio Kino

199
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,560
earlier on his many hats club platform

200
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,390
we've done a couple of panel talks on

201
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,589
there we're gonna continue to do them

202
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:58,360
and Facebook's never never far away from

203
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,080
what we're talking about yeah and he's

204
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,110
the the ringleader of the Knicks and so

205
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,270
because there's news breaking almost it

206
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,279
seems every day if not every week around

207
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,950
Facebook's antics then the current

208
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,420
perception I think is generally that

209
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,110
Facebooker evil core and I think show

210
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,980
how sue agrees with that statement all

211
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,339
right just over half perhaps

212
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,200
trustworthiness is 0 or less than 0 if

213
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,380
that's possible and who has a Facebook

214
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,950
account me too

215
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,529
who who believes I believe but who in

216
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:42,880
the room believes that the Facebook and

217
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,500
other organizations similar need

218
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,740
regulating government regulation or if

219
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,480
not international standards cool and who

220
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,279
on the back of recent transgressions in

221
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,350
the last year 18 months you know 50

222
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,700
billion records it got lost because of

223
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,900
Cambridge analytic here in the data

224
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,200
manipulation that's a political gain

225
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,520
when that all went public and things

226
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,560
have happened since who deleted Facebook

227
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,650
as a consequence of it so Shawn did one

228
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,350
or two people did okay interesting

229
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,480
it's a picture of Zuckerberg looking

230
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,490
about sat in front of Congress where it

231
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,750
was asked a lot of questions and didn't

232
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:22,450
give a lot of answer so yeah we talked

233
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,470
about numbers I'm just going to flick

234
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,029
through these really but yeah they've

235
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:26,500
they've had some pretty big numbers up

236
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,390
to the end of last year so we're talking

237
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,370
well over pushing a good hundred million

238
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,830
records have gone the 50 million there

239
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:36,670
was a breach and let's go 29 million

240
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,380
records were because of lost

241
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,020
authentication tokens and that happens

242
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,390
because relentlessly you're encouraged

243
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,390
to sign up to apps using your Facebook

244
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,490
credentials and for a lot of people we

245
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,370
go with the old usability versus

246
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,370
security usability wins approach and

247
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,170
that's 29 million we're actually not

248
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,579
faced what users per se there were

249
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:59,500
people that had apps plumbed in they

250
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,700
plumbed into the apps using their

251
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,180
Facebook

252
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,570
credentials so that happens but on top

253
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,550
of all that we see increasingly that

254
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,650
they seem to be pretty cool with hate

255
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,420
speech and it drives me a little bit

256
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,160
insane so when somebody says something

257
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,050
really terrible about someone and it

258
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,190
could be across anything can be an

259
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,260
ethnicity it can be around sexuality it

260
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,390
come around political persuasion yeah

261
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,480
for example and then they the response

262
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,190
is really quite slow and they're

263
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,870
generally well we're trying we're doing

264
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,980
everything within our power to remove

265
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,780
this content but yet weeks later you can

266
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,060
still somehow find it I think

267
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,530
Cambridge analytical and things like

268
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,510
leave a you demonstrate that they're

269
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,480
happy with dodgy political things going

270
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,910
on on that platform and that's my take

271
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:55,300
on it where we are a political as

272
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,880
anybody had successful is somebody

273
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,920
removed from Facebook that's been giving

274
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,540
them some [ __ ] or you had a problem with

275
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,700
it now because it's really hard it's

276
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,580
incredibly difficult to do and so they

277
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,190
persist and of course what's your quote

278
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,450
about if it's free then you are if it's

279
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,640
free then you are the product is for any

280
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,530
any platform not just Facebook Twitter

281
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,900
Linkedin any any social media anything

282
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,220
that you don't need to pay for your

283
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,080
deals getting so whether you like or not

284
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,940
gdpr yeah it's or helps alright oh yeah

285
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,820
okay [ __ ] it I don't know yeah so yeah

286
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:41,290
cool we've got a video and Andy

287
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,790
contributed this it's not the only thing

288
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,700
we contributed so we'll just show up for

289
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,560
the minute this is again Mark Zuckerberg

290
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,120
in a Glasgow Congress caught so Aaron

291
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,190
and I just started Facebook no just

292
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,690
white sale shoes and dresses and stuff

293
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,360
and get some likes up some values UV

294
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,970
carts and then a whole computer on and

295
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,640
then before on um

296
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,190
as president and breaks our heart and

297
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,770
tongue for vision or my addresses and

298
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,350
see be honest I'd be happy seven three

299
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,970
pairs of socks turn abolished leaf

300
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,970
repellency propelling order Cisco upper

301
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,020

I like bikes I like cats like videos TV

303

304
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,910
don't know why I'm getting my boss [ __ ]

305
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,890
Elvis Presley believe in Marvel and

306
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,530
another even man and [ __ ] rang before I

307
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,030
knew that problem was president I never

308
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,830
knew people were stealing all the

309
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,320
intelligence nor the addresses not only

310
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,900
do we mean I was just in my bad I just I

311
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,280
just like right and Kutner

312
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,490
and algorithms and stuff I think as your

313
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,930
folks son at the end of the day you've

314
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,910
kept all people's information and you've

315
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,220
kept its yeppity-do da-da-da me master

316
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,350
and the whiteness so Hank you may just

317
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,420
be your fault so stop trying to do it ya

318
00:14:51,420 --> 00:15:04,200
yogi Bob I'd he's had the reason is

319
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,000
about Facebook this week well yesterday

320
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,040
so yeah so those who don't know I'm

321
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,340
Facebook boy it actually came out with

322
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:17,520
Krebs and I think if Krebs and an answer

323
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,840
it's probably Facebook wouldn't have

324
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,130
said anything

325
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,370
Facebook had plaintext passwords stored

326
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,950
on their systems available they say only

327
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,740
internee now the worrying thing for me

328
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,800
is out of that whole thing they have not

329
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,320
force users to reset the passwords

330
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,910
they're basically saying oh it's fine

331
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:41,100
don't worry how many employees worldwide

332
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,860
and Facebook like 10,000 employees right

333
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,270
or and it's like so do you know someone

334
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,640
that knows someone in the Bay Area you

335
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,670
know that works at Facebook and all of a

336
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,350
sudden you know your account could be

337
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,670
accessed by a person acting on behalf of

338
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,770
somebody else to get at all of your

339
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,020
personal information so I think this is

340
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,840
a really huge issue because a lot of

341
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,090
that personal information is really

342
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,460
private and in the wrong hands it can do

343
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,200
a lot of damage can open you up for

344
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,949
social engineering attacks or you know

345
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:21,679
fraud and other things and just again to

346
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,129
reiterate that people many people reuse

347
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:27,559
the same password over and over so it

348
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:30,829
may seem not a big issue but if you

349
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:32,480
using the same password for your banking

350
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,489
and that that's a becomes a big issue so

351
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,949
we're talking about 600 million records

352
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:42,049
that was the the number of Records

353
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:43,609
reported in the in the briefs quite high

354
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:45,499
number which brings us on this kind of

355
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:47,089
slide really but that day it was only

356
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,239
available devs okay so that's all right

357
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,689
no big deal

358
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:52,399
but it takes you back to the original

359
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,779
point that look about May which is

360
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,089
privacy is a social norm of the past as

361
00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:00,079
far as in his head okay so this is this

362
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,269
slide that will changed it last week and

363
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:05,449
in previous shows that we've done gigs

364
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:08,299
we've done it said that there reckoned

365
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:10,369
there were at least three breached

366
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:12,769
records per every man woman and child on

367
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:15,380
the planet 21 billion had a chat with

368
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,510
Troy hunt about it given that if anyone

369
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,130
knows about the likely number of

370
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,659
breaches and records it's gonna be him

371
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:22,789
right and he said yeah I think you're

372
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:25,119
way off we're talking pushing 80 billion

373
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,839
around the planet

374
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,539
now that's an absolute atomic number

375
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:31,130
mind-blowing number as far as I'm

376
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,679
concerned and it's a game because what

377
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,149
we're talking about is in fact around 10

378
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:38,059
records per every man woman and child on

379
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,700
the planet and that is absolutely insane

380
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,950
and the footnote or the carry out that

381
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,620
Troy game it was that's what we know

382
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,419
those are the numbers we know about and

383
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:51,159
that is literally the tip of the iceberg

384
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:58,880
okay so another show of hands if you

385
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,419
don't mind

386
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:04,490
who knows who these guys are not too

387
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,320
many people now

388
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:16,870
okay so there are conservative US based

389
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,899
organization so they are Trump

390
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,360
supporting outfit and they're trapped

391
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,659
members who are allied with the

392
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:30,350
conservative movement in the US so

393
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,669
they're trying to make America great

394
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:34,240
again that's their aim in their own

395
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,639
perspective of it but like any extreme

396
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:39,470
organization they're a little bit

397
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,809
sensitive to criticism and that's who

398
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:45,230
they are yeah so who knows

399
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:49,539
Robert Baptiste rubber French researcher

400
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:53,330
great guy pioneer a trailblazer to what

401
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,110
we're all about

402
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,210
it goes by the name of Eliot August

403
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,100
infects the name from the the character

404
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,909
in mr. robot his handle deaf society

405
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:05,809
done in kind of leat stuff he found a

406
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:07,370
vulnerability in one of their our mobile

407
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,669
applications and took the the

408
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:11,299
responsible route of letting them know

409
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:13,490
about it the problem is that they

410
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,710
reactive in an extremely negative way

411
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,379
and very publicly and said that he they

412
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:20,450
wrote a blog accusing him of being an

413
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,600
anti conservative hacker and put out on

414
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,269
the internet told told the world that

415
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:28,190
they reported him to the FBI for being a

416
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,899
hacker and he'd stolen their day or and

417
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:34,009
all this kind of [ __ ] okay

418
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:36,649
so who here's familiar with that apk

419
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:40,610
file right okay so um there's lots of

420
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,679
utilities including hex editors that you

421
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:45,580
can open up an apk file and look inside

422
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,919
that's what he did okay that's his

423
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:51,200
crimes for which he could be sentenced

424
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:59,210
to what 20 years in a federal prison so

425
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:04,970
um after that we saw kicked off as in

426
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,629
the community kicked off i think only

427
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:12,919
half kicked off Andy Andrew Tierney

428
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,980
kicked off cyber Gibbons from the PTP

429
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,409
one around his colleagues I kicked off

430
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:20,000
and it kind of got

431
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,170
bit messy because pylons ensued when do

432
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,790
they not see you when there's a bit of

433
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,410
drama intersect the infra sec drama

434
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,870
clock got reset about 15 times in that

435
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,820
particular day yeah for anyone who

436
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,170
doesn't know the infinite drama clock is

437
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,780
this chaps creation Stuart here just

438
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,460
wave up and what people know that you

439
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,310
there and one of the reasons the bear

440
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,630
farmers exist is because of infoset

441
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,520
drama and too much of it and so we

442
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,230
thought well [ __ ] it let's put a group

443
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,860
of people together in other laughs I'm

444
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,460
warming you up mate yeah and so that's

445
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,840
part what we do before we actually

446
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,250
developed any kind of plan we thought

447
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,530
let's just have some fun and part of

448
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,090
that was trying to cure some of the

449
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,910
drama a bot that would Stuart's created

450
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,560
now is the impact drama clock and if you

451
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,210
hashtag InfoSec drama clock it will

452
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,460
reset the clock to zero and it's it's

453
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,550
never gone it's never gone above was

454
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,580
that before you told anybody existed

455
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:20,720
right yeah cool an individual called

456
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,510
felon or a for an hour however you

457
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,770
pronounce it appeared this one on

458
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,060
Saturday evening last Saturday evening

459
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,330
and there was a huge troll fight went on

460
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,820
him being the troll Minos being that the

461
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,560
kind of defenders of the faith as it

462
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,510
were so we're talking cyber given as

463
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,280
myself a bunch of other people just

464
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,650
trying to close this guy down and it was

465
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,410
I was getting a few messages from fellow

466
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,820
bear farmers around just leave it alone

467
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,980
got a bad to forget about it but

468
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,320
normally that would be my response but

469
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,090
this time around I was a bit pissed off

470
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,820
because of Elliot's good work and he was

471
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,590
getting trashed not only was he been

472
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,080
trashed by 63 red it was being trashed

473
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,870
by so-called security experts and I was

474
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,960
having nonetheless so we looked into the

475
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,510
guy and we we found we did a lot of oh

476
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,040
oh sin on the chat which you were just

477
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,990
heard all about in Stu's talk and we

478
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,490
found out ultimately that it was a bit

479
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,710
of a white supremacist we found the ramp

480
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,650
each week stripped a thread about why

481
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,870
white males in the US have got zero

482
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,280
opportunities these days and it's a

483
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,590
disgrace the country's gone to [ __ ]

484
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,870
that's enough white supremacy [ __ ]

485
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,180
from a weed ops that out a little bit

486
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,650
and he kind of went quiet and we're not

487
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,810
I don't believe her from him since

488
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:43,759
sewing and I think you know not to be

489
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:45,200
self-righteous but I think we won that

490
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,269
battle and it was one worth fighting in

491
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:49,990
my opinion and then I went about oh

492
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,870
thank you there's a collection one who's

493
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,669
familiar with collection hat number one

494
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:59,059
and the ensuing collections not too many

495
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:00,710
people but yeah that was a bunch of

496
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,720
aggregated cobbled together day that was

497
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,399
found I'm looking around II talk about

498
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:06,909
this in a little bit more detail

499
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:09,409
yeah so the collection dumps was

500
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:11,899
essentially the biggest public available

501
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:14,600
dumps that were released public sphere

502
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,580
you can download you can still download

503
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,369
them on time and round about a terabyte

504
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:21,740
terabyte in half of there and and the

505
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,419
REC at the moment like that there's

506
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:24,440
still people trolling through the day

507
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,990
about the reckon is about 73 unique

508
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,879
though sorry someone just havethey

509
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:31,220
billion unique records which is there's

510
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,529
quite a few but this is records from

511
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:35,480
things like Bitcoin forums pornography

512
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,869
gambling breaches things like Facebook

513
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:40,460
Twitter like the the breaches we talked

514
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,419
about earlier on the Facebook things

515
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,980
that they're in there lengthens and

516
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,919
their MySpace anyone remember MySpace

517
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:51,230
yeah yeah that's what lots of lots of

518
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,519
different things but the thing is it's

519
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,139
not just usernames and passwords cuz

520
00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:55,429
often when you see breaches it's like oh

521
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:56,960
yeah I'm pastor and breach but this was

522
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,850
like pest identify information there's

523
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,279
credit card data and there there was bet

524
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,710
coin addresses bet coin wallets like

525
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,419
lots of stuff those back on what I'd

526
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:07,909
probably know off to some nation-state

527
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:10,610
probably Russia and or other nation

528
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,860
states are available but like they're

529
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,690
they're probably off there that would

530
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,840
lose the money lost yeah but essentially

531
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,539
it's a [ __ ] ton of data and yeah that is

532
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:27,019
that is a unit yep that is that is mo

533
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:31,779
fascism trademarks and [ __ ] and but yeah

534
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:34,460
yeah that's exactly what it is is anyone

535
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,019
actually trolled through the or had a

536
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:38,990
look at it at all apart from me having

537
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,299
the data sort of illegally it's not

538
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:43,039
illegal but like having a lot of they

539
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,880
are under GDP are up higher

540
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,980
Lee is illegal but it's not really

541
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,390
because I'm not using it I'm not selling

542
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,010
it so everyone sit for free they can

543
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,860
have for free because right I'm gonna

544
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,470
run though I think you just subscribed

545
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,180
why it's all in breach of GDP out there

546
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:02,040
but we'll move on quick but again it you

547
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,870
know the tip of the iceberg analogy I I

548
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,220
was gonna remove that because he's

549
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,570
slightly shittiest technology isn't it

550
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:11,700
the tip the metaphor well it's gotta

551
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,760
exist like it I felt better about when

552
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,680
when memes came up in Stu's talking

553
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,330
about what we've got now if he's doing

554
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:24,660
memes yeah yeah so if memes are cool

555
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,370
then tip of the iceberg metaphors are

556
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,470
equally cool but we again we only know

557
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,390
what we know and that lot there is the

558
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,690
stuff that we don't so this is a website

559
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,360
called information is beautiful and it's

560
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,610
finally served over HTTP it wasn't

561
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,860
previously but it's a nice visualization

562
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,160
that I find really useful to take into

563
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,800
the workplace and demonstrate to people

564
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,140
how bad this problem actually is and how

565
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,770
far back it goes and if you look at this

566
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,800
and I see in a room full of people at my

567
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,250
workplace people's faces kind of sink

568
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,280
them as they realize that they were an

569
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,220
Equifax customer or they have a Twitter

570
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,560
account or like in a regular Marriott

571
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,160
user yeah

572
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,960
but the point being is we're all in here

573
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,590
somewhere

574
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,120
yeah and that's just something that

575
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,630
we've got to get used to and move on

576
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:23,040
from all right though this is the drum

577
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,350
solo part of the beer farmers and just

578
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,230
if you were confused we're a band in the

579
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,600
sense of like Robin Hood and his merry

580
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,640
band a band of brothers not technically

581
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,100
a not a band with any musical talent

582
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,930
although Mike worked in that industry

583
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,390
for a while

584
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,570
load average sure okay medium time all

585
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:42,810
right

586
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,690
um this is the helm Gibbons who has

587
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,090
heard of the helm Gibbons security

588
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,970
vendor okay awesome so this is what

589
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,850
happens when security researchers

590
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,550
confront companies that aren't well

591
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,410
trained in the art of engage

592
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,630
with the security research community and

593
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,180
let me be honest here sometimes we are a

594
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,950
little bit difficult and we may be

595
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,280
special snowflakes okay but the reality

596
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,770
is is that if you approach a company

597
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,230
saying there is a vulnerability it's

598
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,960
gonna go one of two directions they're

599
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,270
gonna be receptive or they're gonna be

600
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,060
not and whether they're not this

601
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,900
escalates into what I like to call the

602
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,630
full-blown cyber shitstorm okay

603
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,450
now we've seen this now as you can see

604
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:37,020
in our red 63 example 63 red we already

605
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,260
were at a level three with legal threats

606
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,660
by vendor against security researcher

607
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,660
etc etc okay so we had already escalated

608
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,020
to there this is not necessary for

609
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,840
vendors to do this is why it is so

610
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,050
important that you look through and look

611
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,270
for the disclosure responsible

612
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:01,710
disclosure process and in some cases we

613
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,360
saw an almost an unprecedented event

614
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,640
about three months ago where security

615
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,950
researcher who had been actively engaged

616
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,530
with a company was physically assaulted

617
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:16,230
by the company at an information

618
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,150
security event did you guys hear about

619
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:22,800
this yeah so anyways it was working on

620
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,560
online gambling systems and they found

621
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,350
that there was really no security on

622
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,840
this gambling system it was the points

623
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,010
system for casinos and they showed they

624
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,170
could change the amount of points people

625
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,990
had their personal data was ft peed in

626
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,090
and out there was like literally no

627
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,100
security on these consoles inside

628
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,740
casinos which you would think hey it's a

629
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,020
casino why would I want you know how to

630
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,570
have IT security on my fish tank why

631
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,050
would I want that right so anyways what

632
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,410
happened was the company not only was

633
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,210
not even up front with the security

634
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,290
researcher but actively denigrating them

635
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,110
daxing them doing everything after the

636
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,350
security researcher went to the FBI

637
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,240
voluntary disclosed

638
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,230
what he had and the FBI actually

639
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,540
facilitated a meeting with the vendor so

640
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,670
level six is getting punched in the face

641
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,550
because that is just completely

642
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,030
unacceptable

643
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,340
so as security researchers I'm gonna

644
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,460
hand the mic over to Sean because Sean

645
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,340
has had a lot of experience with this

646
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,440
and he's got a couple of stories and

647
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,740
anecdotes to tell thanks Ian

648
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,760
so from my perspective I haven't had

649
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,200
negative in terms of being harassed but

650
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,160
I've had essentially the cold shoulder

651
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,370
here was aware of 500px

652
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,740
the breach okay no meanie

653
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,130
so the got breached the st. out a lot of

654
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,670
password resets emails fun I mean that's

655
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,800
the right thing to do but the problem is

656
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,460
the link in there was HTTP probably

657
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,140
something you don't want to do when you

658
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,190
suffered a breach so I contacted 500px

659
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,540
said look cuz please look into this no

660
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,310
response

661
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,720
the only response was yes someone's

662
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,390
looking into it yeah

663
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:27,860
other companies again major companies

664
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,450
same thing over and over and over

665
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,330
yeah they don't get a response or they

666
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,890
simply fix it behind your back

667
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:38,580
and that's it companies need to realize

668
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,560
that when researchers are coming up to

669
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,900
them it's helping their Mart it's not

670
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,760
trying to take you to get the company if

671
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,530
we were really that interested in taking

672
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,240
a dig at the company guess what we'll go

673
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,820
on don't know the dark web or find some

674
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,520
way of making some financial gain out of

675
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,440
it we're not gaining anything out of it

676
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:03,200
we're hoping the company that we see so

677
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,230
this was a kind of half the press so

678
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,060
it's a bit of a an interchange between

679
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,550
Ian and Ken Munro one of the colleague

680
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:16,100
of Romney's from Pentos partners yeah

681
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,170
London thing and you saw them doing the

682
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:22,320
pen testing of the ships that was just

683
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,620
mind-blowing that was

684
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,100
really okay I can you preview can't

685
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,150
account yeah of course

686
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:33,559
so this was um what I saw happening to a

687
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,630
lot of communities this thread can't

688
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,880
took off with a lot of people wading

689
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,549
into it on both the absurd and the

690
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:43,760
positive but you know what we're finding

691
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,610
in the industry right now is we have a

692
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,890
communication difficulty we have huge

693
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,140
brains all of us here have huge brains

694
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,049
and can understand the implications of

695
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:56,740
something like a remote code execution

696
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,919
businesses and business people don't and

697
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,620
we need to understand that in order to

698
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,230
have a conversation with those people we

699
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,690
need to educate them and in a in a

700
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,760
collaborative way and not just like

701
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:17,929
scare the crap out of them just made the

702
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:26,240
point okay we kind of hope that get the

703
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,179
reaction that it got and show of hands

704
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:31,570
who doesn't know who this guy is

705
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,659
okay that's cool so he's John McAfee and

706
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:54,649
he invented cybersecurity somewhere

707
00:32:54,649 --> 00:32:56,360
between the USA and Venezuela or

708
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,789
somewhere he also may or may not have

709
00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:00,529
murdered his neighbor but that's another

710
00:33:00,529 --> 00:33:03,320
story one of the things he does is a lot

711
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,440
is lends his name to things that he

712
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,299
Caesar are valuable and so

713
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:10,760
cryptocurrency is a big thing for him

714
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,440
and he's a what's a cop pumpin shunt or

715
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,950
pump and dump

716
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,390
that's the one pumping and shillings

717
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,390
probably same sort of thing isn't it and

718
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,399
and yeah he's made a lot of money out of

719
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,169
it apparently he's got no money anymore

720
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,789
house he's a set free

721
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:28,130
according to a recent testimony but

722
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,559
recently he started becoming very active

723
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,840
he's now a likely presidential candidate

724
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,140
for the 2020 elections in the USA if you

725
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,890
follow him on Twitter

726
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,610
but if you follow him on Twitter then

727
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:54,240
yet unblocked what he said all right a

728
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,100
really quick show of hands who's blocked

729
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:01,290
by John McAfee on Twitter no idea but I

730
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,220
think it might have been some of the

731
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,040
things that I did with your guys that

732
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,110
got me into trouble with but bet by

733
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,369
right okay it was a portable

734
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:10,710
cryptocurrency wallet with hashtag

735
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,679
unhackable and he went on social media

736
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,989
and said guys is unhackable I say so

737
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,940
trust me I know I'm talking about

738
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,840
because I invented cyber security and

739
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,210
other companies similar in October

740
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:26,580
Pandora car alarms similar sort of time

741
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,090
tap lock and the top three there and

742
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,070
this isn't really a sales pitch for his

743
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,679
organization but it just but it just so

744
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,929
happens that they did their business on

745
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:47,100
them it's still blue it's still blue and

746
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,690
trusty fires one that was at you and you

747
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,250
and John Kim came up with and they were

748
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,960
a company telling you that let's encrypt

749
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,730
it's bad we've got a little slide about

750
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,250
that but the general point is just do

751
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,490
not as a vendor or a creator of

752
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,680
something ever go out there and tell the

753
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,960
world that it's unhackable just don't do

754
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,990
it

755
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,510
[Laughter]

756
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,570
but years come and go and the and it

757
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,480
just keeps happening no one learns well

758
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,290
actually bit by bit for I learned so

759
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,230
here's a tweet I I went to war with bit

760
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,750
fire on a number of things they posted a

761
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,369
really cynical picture of a guy with a

762
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:43,300
noose around his neck

763
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,570
and I lost my [ __ ] about that and I pile

764
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:49,440
I personally piled on bit fire and

765
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,170
eventually a few CEOs later a few CEOs

766
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:57,460
later they found a little bit sense and

767
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,290
this story kind of speaks that that

768
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,000
speaks volumes about how their attitudes

769
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,580
changed somebody else maybe one of the

770
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,860
other organizations had gone on with the

771
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,570
old hashtag on hackable thing and their

772
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,070
response was quite good very

773
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:12,070
self-effacing so best not call your

774
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:18,600
product unhackable going forward I agree

775
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:24,070
and you won't want to work for them what

776
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,619
you know and that may be in their comedy

777
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:30,010
department Alliance but am one one good

778
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,690
thing that did come on top of the fact

779
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,550
that they they saw their own lights was

780
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,860
the pilot I did it ended up with hackers

781
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,450
mental health gained a $10,000 donation

782
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,630
which I was very pleased with okay I can

783
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,460
confirm they confirmed they did receive

784
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,930
that money so it wasn't just a lot of PR

785
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:52,840
it actually happened yeah Sean hey go

786
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:58,869
make so this started off with John the

787
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:01,260
other buy a beer for me is not yeah I

788
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,670
forgot what it was exactly was something

789
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,470
around the certificate related tweet and

790
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,800
suddenly trustee fired did something

791
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,480
that again please don't do this

792
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,900
thread jacking used use the tweets to

793
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,220
try push their own product

794
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,200
so those II don't know threads lacking I

795
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,920
post something on Twitter saying Allah

796
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,090
cats and some company a pet shop goes or

797
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,430
we have thousands of cattle sales and

798
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,680
yueshen barred from this person it's

799
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:38,260
using a tweet to push join gain and

800
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,250
using cats so what these guys did is

801
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:46,090
they were blasting out let's let's

802
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,619
encrypt and let's encrypt them up

803
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:51,190
Mannion has done one of the moist for

804
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,430
industry out of many companies the fact

805
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,980
that they the world's largest CA

806
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,370
is testament to that free certificates

807
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,920
automated they've changed the game and I

808
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,510
think one of the reasons why we have so

809
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,640
many sites on HTTP is due to let's

810
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,700
encrypt so they're doing a fantastic job

811
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,410
these guys came along and said let's

812
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:14,350
encrypt certificates or rubbish don't

813
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,990
use them use our Evie certs where you

814
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,320
pay Adamo hundreds of pounds of for two

815
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,720
years and they had this whole list the

816
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,520
full list is not there but they

817
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,870
basically went through different points

818
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:34,030
trainee basically ripoff let a let's

819
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,350
encrypt certificates are now I went

820
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,420
through each one and basically they're

821
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,180
all not true

822
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,620
Tulley baser offer Lars and also in the

823
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,940
top there let's just say there's slide

824
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:54,670
trademark infringement at the top save

825
00:38:54,670 --> 00:39:00,070
anybody and shortly after unrelated to

826
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,960
this situation right old people sir a

827
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,400
whole bunch of Eevee certificates were

828
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,990
released on the dark web and there's a

829
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,850
dark web shop offering Eevee

830
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:15,100
certificates oops and yep cool we're

831
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,660
good and a quick fact check around

832
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,850
British Airways breach that was nothing

833
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:22,510
to do with us HTM HTTP it was to do with

834
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,010
a broken JavaScript that was being

835
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:36,000
consumed so 100% fact fail here indeed

836
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,990
we might be talking about not lowering

837
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,920
the ash well the good news is that good

838
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,660
people exist I'd like to think that most

839
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,400
people in this room falling a category

840
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,040
one where another we certainly do what

841
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,870
we're here for so there are things out

842
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,400
there that happening companies do look

843
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,930
at security controls that they've got in

844
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,580
place responsible disclosure is still

845
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,170
finding its feet and it's fair to say

846
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,490
but it's there

847
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,200
bug bounties exist we've got a bit on

848
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,210
that in a little while there are other

849
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:04,660
things ok well that's a lot so can

850
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,660
everybody see that picture of Ian maybe

851
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,270
not so clear this side of the building

852
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:14,260
but yeah MFA so everyone knows what MFA

853
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,390
is right multi-factor authentication you

854
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,310
know it as two step or two factor auth

855
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,420
and so on

856
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,340
they'll roughly mean the same sort of

857
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,160
thing yeah the concept is something you

858
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,210
know something you have sort of

859
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,500
something you know are you username and

860
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,330
password pair and there's something you

861
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,670
have is at our assay token thing an

862
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,650
Authenticator app on your mobile that

863
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:36,550
sort of stuff an SMS message okay so

864
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,980
you're here two sides in the debate one

865
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,050
is the SMS is crap it's really unsafe

866
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,520
thing it's no it's probably crapped on

867
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,070
safer you work for a government okay but

868
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,450
for my mom it's probably pretty cool I

869
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,280
don't see anybody setting up a cell site

870
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,750
or doing a same swap attack on my mum

871
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,540
any time soon or even me

872
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,540
so the advice for orgonite the advice

873
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,640
for organizations is where possible

874
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,080
deploy and we know there is an

875
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,200
engineering piece involved but do it if

876
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,900
you can do it as a consumer of sites and

877
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,050
services if it's available to you damn

878
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,140
right that signed up to that and a

879
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,430
password breach is something you can

880
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:18,810
probably survive if you've got an MFA

881
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,270
I'll ask you Twitter or Facebook I said

882
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,610
probably

883
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,570
so around responsible disclosure

884
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,610
companies have got to accept that

885
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,420
they're not going to get it right a

886
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,720
hundred percent at the time tell us you

887
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,660
know we've got if we've got a scible

888
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,550
disclosure policy go look for it if

889
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:39,700
we've got a security app firm calm email

890
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,580
account try it if we've got yep if we've

891
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,310
got well dot well-known slash security

892
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:48,310
not text is a standard that should

893
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,380
contain security contacts in case you

894
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,120
find a bug or a problem on a web app and

895
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:57,910
contacts that's like really really

896
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,470
important because otherwise the

897
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,990
developer research is going to get the

898
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:05,080
hell in anyway yeah absolutely

899
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,580
and there's a debate around how long you

900
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,720
give a firm we can have that

901
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,900
conversation after after hours and the

902
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,970
good firm will fix and keep in contact

903
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,550
with the researcher and we won't be 63

904
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:20,650
red okay so quick time check test and

905
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:22,000
fix you stuff so this is for

906
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,320
organizations I guess in a lot

907
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,150
go through the academic process at the

908
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,700
moment but the sort of information

909
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,840
should sit somewhere in your

910
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,220
consciousness for when you're out in the

911
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,660
industry doing stuff whether you're

912
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,920
working as a pen tester whether you're

913
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,720
working as a blue Timur and offender in

914
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,640
an organization these are things that

915
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,500
you'll constantly come into contact with

916
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:43,090
so don't be fear don't fear pen testing

917
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,830
new processes within your company are

918
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:45,520
your people

919
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,380
okay so these are all parts important

920
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,120
parts of the chain of security within an

921
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:55,030
organization it's not well fear of pen

922
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,260
testers and developers with all these

923
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,400
guys going to come and break my [ __ ]

924
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,750
it's like well actually no run here too

925
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,940
quite no problems but also tell you how

926
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,340
to fix your [ __ ] so we're helping you

927
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,720
for the better not making it what

928
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,700
sometimes you've got [ __ ] code and it

929
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,900
drops a lot of tables but actually your

930
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:14,500
fault not mine just about testing your

931
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,170
application it's testing your processes

932
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,360
making sure you have the right tests

933
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,120
your employees have appropriate training

934
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,460
or so and so forth so pen testing is a

935
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,670
vital part of your development process

936
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:31,870
yeah completely great so yeah get

937
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,340
independent audit and don't be afraid of

938
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,260
getting a private independent company to

939
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,100
come and tell you what you're doing

940
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,080
wrong it's absolutely vital you need

941
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,610
somebody marking your homework otherwise

942
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:41,560
you're gonna live in this bubble of a

943
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,770
secure of misplaced yeah the false sense

944
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,050
of security until you get attacked and

945
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:50,170
breached make you secure it ends to have

946
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,210
adult conversations with people in the

947
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,980
business about the relevance of security

948
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,950
and then bring those decisions into the

949
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,960
design processes whether it's a web app

950
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,640
whether it's a server and network you're

951
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,750
building a new process you're

952
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,270
implementing in the business whatever

953
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:05,530
start at the very beginning beyond the

954
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,750
Train at the first when it leaves a

955
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,670
station because too often were not were

956
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,830
brought in worst case scenario when the

957
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:14,710
shits at the fan or best-case scenario

958
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,510
towards the end when we're seen as a bit

959
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:25,480
of a blocker yep yep and just one other

960
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,560
point as young developers you should be

961
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,410
a gas if you're using actual live

962
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,210
customer data in your tests and

963
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:37,030
development environments live customer

964
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:37,420
day

965
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:43,799
should be in production only yep

966
00:44:43,799 --> 00:44:48,510
patching okay patch everything well good

967
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:51,640
okay we'll move on have I been poned

968
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,700
anybody put their email account in here

969
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,700
quick Cheyenne's okay

970
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,809
guarantee you'll have an email account

971
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:01,839
that is in here it's great for sobering

972
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,130
people up in the morning meet and when

973
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:06,569
you want to talk about password security

974
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:17,460
[Music]

975
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:20,700
all the password managers are available

976
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,760
bug bounties do you say quick they're

977
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,049
not pen testing that's excellent

978
00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:31,510
okay it's a way of monetizing and

979
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:33,400
incentivizing people to do the right

980
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,690
thing with a book that they find rather

981
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,069
than the wrong thing I think it's a

982
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:37,270
paradigm shift

983
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:39,339
really before book ballots existed what

984
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:40,930
did hackers do to monetize they may be

985
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:52,599
sold data and as a company yeah as a

986
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:54,339
security person that works in an

987
00:45:54,339 --> 00:45:56,650
organization that cares it demonstrates

988
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:06,190
you can yep okay we're gonna fly you're

989
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:09,549
using up valuable time now in okay a

990
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:12,040
breach is not a when not on if a lot of

991
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,839
organizations are already breached but

992
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,670
on the way blissfully unaware the fact

993
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,079
that that date is already out there so

994
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:19,000
it's gonna happen so make sure you're

995
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,099
ready for it because that's what it'll

996
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:24,150
feel like when it happens okay and

997
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,319
that's what your head like might feel

998
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,990
look like we'll make mistakes but how we

999
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,150
respond to problems is what will be

1000
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:35,530
defined with defined by so the truth is

1001
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:40,270
in their reversal of an x-files slogan

1002
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:42,819
so the key things out except it's

1003
00:46:42,819 --> 00:46:43,960
happened you know it's a bit like the

1004
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,430
bereavement curve just except it's

1005
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,109
happened don't sit there in denial don't

1006
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:48,609
start blaming other people when quite

1007
00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:50,190
frankly it's probably your own screw

1008
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,640
control failed our absence of control

1009
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,110
seek support so head to your local

1010
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,570
search organization in the UK it's the

1011
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,750
NCSC or the certs are available they can

1012
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,290
help you

1013
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:03,300
you've got to notify the authorities

1014
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,670
okay there are various time scales in

1015
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,170
which you've got opportunities to do

1016
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:09,420
that but do it and they can also as well

1017
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,190
as receive your reporting they can help

1018
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:13,950
you recover from the problem find out

1019
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,570
what happened and learn from it that's

1020
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,610
critically important and take it on the

1021
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,430
chin and be out all about it we've seen

1022
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,290
some really great breach notification so

1023
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,300
we should call those out some people do

1024
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:58,950
well so yeah you can you could draw your

1025
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,570
own conclusions as to the use cases you

1026
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:01,950
may personally help for something like

1027
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:03,770
this I'm making no comment whatsoever

1028
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:06,150
but it was only said it was a good

1029
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,160
disclosure it was received well by the

1030
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,200
company unfortunately they did stop

1031
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,720
trading not long after okay

1032
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,280
so excellent so they are available

1033
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:19,470
freely available on the web just say

1034
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:22,710
point to one of your partners in this is

1035
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:24,780

1037
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,770
resources that you need if you are

1038
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,780
suffering a data breach even if you

1039
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:36,540
don't have like cyber coverage he's

1040
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:40,499
ahead of the discuss breach

1041
00:48:40,499 --> 00:48:43,420
very very few who's heard of aircrafts

1042
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,509
breech yeah significant the difference

1043
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:49,180
being Equifax how not to handle breech

1044
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,759

1053
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:09,160
said yes we are under attack we are

1054
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,930
looking at it they didn't try and blame

1055
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:11,499
anybody

1056
00:49:11,499 --> 00:49:13,569

lot of conferences we're now speaking at

vendor based yep before engaging in

1075
00:49:56,709 --> 00:49:58,329
debate it's worth knowing what you're

1076
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,739
talking about because people will pick

1077
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:02,679
you apart if you don't and then respect

1078
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:03,759

1080
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:11,499
their things so I'm mad yeah exactly

1081
00:50:11,499 --> 00:50:13,359
quite my background is application

1082
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,249
security brava to play a quick game of

1083
00:50:15,249 --> 00:50:16,660
catch up on other things like

1084
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,660
infrastructure security etc engage you

1085
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,549
share so even if don't become a serial

1086
00:50:21,549 --> 00:50:23,109
reposted because then you become a

1087
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:25,469
thought leader

1088
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,900
or an influencer and you appear in a

1089
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,970
list now no one wants to be in a list

1090
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:32,859
right but you see them and the people

1091
00:50:32,859 --> 00:50:35,079

1092
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:36,249
Twitter followers and never tweet

1093
00:50:36,249 --> 00:50:37,749
anything of their own okay

1094
00:50:37,749 --> 00:50:39,339
they only retweet and retweet and

1095
00:50:39,339 --> 00:50:44,739
retweet be one of us no but if you find

1096
00:50:44,739 --> 00:50:46,420
something if it's a document you found

1097
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,710
that might change somebody's life one

1098
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:49,150
person's life change was about in my

1099
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:52,180

Dickinson so that's the guy and he's

1106
00:51:06,069 --> 00:51:07,660
probably the reasons the bear farmers

1107
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,309
