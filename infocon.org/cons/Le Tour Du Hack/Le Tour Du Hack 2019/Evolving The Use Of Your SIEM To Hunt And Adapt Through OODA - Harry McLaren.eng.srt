1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,390
and so thank you very much for choosing

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,779
track 1 with my incredibly wordy title

3
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:09,280
that I should have probably reworded

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,469
this is evolving the use of your seem to

5
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,570
hunt and adapt through Judah I'm gonna

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,380
talk about what that is my name's Harry

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,240
McLaren I'm a managing consultant to ETS

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,360
security I'm an alumnus of Napier

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,520
University Curley recep's going to

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,320
connect and also this Blanc user group

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,690
Edinburgh leader as well I find me on

12
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,348
Twitter certs because it wouldn't be an

13
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:36,070
interested without them my employer we

14
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,440
build and run Sox throughout the country

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,019
and we build and run seams throughout

16
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:43,749
the country as well and so not really go

17
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:45,489
talk about them but just so you know who

18
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:48,309
we are so what I'm gonna go through

19
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,499
lasts about 45 minutes I'll leave some

20
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:52,210
time for questions and leave some time

21
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,519
for me a to over run because I've

22
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:56,589
changed half this deck in the last 24

23
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,300
hours which is a terrible idea and you

24
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,539
should never ever do but it couldn't be

25
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:03,399
helped because I couldn't get a bug out

26
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,930
my head about some of the content so

27
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,880
we're going to talk about a problem a

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,189
problem that I think is very prevalent

29
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:11,170
throughout our industry talk about some

30
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,700
foundational knowledge so those of you

31
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,280
that perhaps are not as aware of what

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,170
socks or seams are so everyone's

33
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,180
hopefully on the same page gonna talk a

34
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,740
little bit about what I see is some

35
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,229
ineffectiveness within both sock and

36
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:27,880
seems to quite odor which is a really

37
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,880
old methodology essentially that comes

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,710
from the Air Force and I think it was

39
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,930
World War one or two they're gonna go

40
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,850
across into a bit of threat hunting and

41
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,950
control gaps and then finish showing off

42
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,659
by talking about how to change that

43
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:44,829
platform quickly let's scale some terms

44
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:46,750
of reference are on the same page if I

45
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,399
say the word sock I'm referring to a

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,039
Security Operations Center this could be

47
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:54,149
synonymous with a security guy girl team

48
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,859
individual analyst doesn't necessarily

49
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,450
need to be in its own organizational

50
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,390
units but that's what I'm gonna say seam

51
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,740
security information and event

52
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,049
management this is a tool it's usually

53
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,060
built on a big data platform it will

54
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,949
usually involve some form of correlation

55
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,409
or logic or rule engine or something

56
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:13,510
along those lines it's within the

57
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,769
context of this talk going to be our

58
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,280
primary tool to discuss

59
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,030
hunting hunting threat hunting or threat

60
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,430
analysis this is a proactive defensive

61
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,980
action so this is actually going to look

62
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,050
for things in your environment that are

63
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,630
at risk or causing your problem or a

64
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,970
threat actor and this is trying to do

65
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,709
something about it as opposed to waiting

66
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:36,110
until your tool tells you or until

67
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,280
Twitter tells you that you have a

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,030
problem CTB's tactics or tools

69
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,250
techniques and procedures these are

70
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,160
typically ways of describing activity or

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,980
methods so your threat actor will have

72
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,350
TTP's your defenders will have their own

73
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,590
TTP's and again if i say it that's what

74
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,950
i'm referring to so starting with a

75
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,850
problem so I have you can't read that

76
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,410
wasn't expecting quite so much sunlight

77
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,380
having lived in Scotland for ten years

78
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,720
this is a quote from Sean Riley he's the

79
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,880
chief science officer and he's a really

80
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,530
interesting guy and he you know he's

81
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,239
traveled the world a far more experience

82
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,400
than I do so I thought rather than come

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,670
up my own quotes I'll just steal his and

84
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,200
I really liked that last part which is

85
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,480
as a business so you know as a line of

86
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,519
business whether you're a large global

87
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,650
enterprise or bank or whether you're a

88
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,690
small to medium-sized business how

89
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,090
fundamentally do I detect that there are

90
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,100
threats on my network trying to do

91
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,280
something that's naughty and the

92
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,350
solution to that or the solution that

93
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,690
kind of we've been peddling for a very

94
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,079
long time I say we I do work for a you

95
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,299
know a vendor fundamentally so it is a

96
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,970
we is well you need a sock

97
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,209
everyone needs a sock you've gotta have

98
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,359
lots of screens ideally as many big TVs

99
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:58,570
on the wall with huge map showing

100
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,000
packets traveling from China or North

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,239
Korea attacking your network looks great

102
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,100
for the chief executive to walk in and

103
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,440
go look at all those attacks we're aware

104
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,510
of all these attacks and we're safe

105
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,019
totally safe and those maps rarely mean

106
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,390
anything obviously but it's nice to look

107
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,930
at something pretty on a wall and so I'm

108
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,850
not going to be coming up to you and

109
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,500
saying socks aren't the solution but I'm

110
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,250
going to say that they're not very

111
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,860
effective I'm going to get to that so

112
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,110
first of all what's in a sock

113
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,289
when I talk about a sock capability or

114
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:34,610
function I'm talking about the kinds of

115
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,680
things that a security team who are

116
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,780
defenders are likely doing with their

117
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,530
time so on the kind of more normal BAU

118
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,960
side ie business as usual we're talking

119
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,719
about monitoring so this is often

120
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,060
monitoring other tooling so for example

121
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,050
a firewall a wife your identity solution

122
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,669
next-gen antivirus or these types of

123
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,979
things they see something they think is

124
00:04:57,979 --> 00:04:59,750
bad and they tell you about it

125
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,610
someone's got to wait for that alert and

126
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,270
hopefully do something else okay the

127
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,009
more detect into the more detection

128
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:08,180
space this is when you start to get

129
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,860
while detection analysis sorry this is

130
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,270
where you start to correlate that data

131
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,800
so this is where you might start to

132
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,780
build your own rules your own logic so

133
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,310
rather than just waiting for your

134
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,469
firewall to say bad is happening it's

135
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:21,199
saying oh but I'm seeing this and this

136
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,229
and this so bad is probably happening

137
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,449
okay so it's trying to bring a bit more

138
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,400
intelligence to it and you know

139
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,110
correlation or correlation rules or

140
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,979
searches is a way we describe this

141
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:35,419
hunting which is like the focus

142
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,190
fundamentally on what we're gonna get to

143
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,650
and this is proactive so this is looking

144
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,479
for things you don't know about because

145
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,279
the interesting thing is when you write

146
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,620
a rule you've got to give it a pattern

147
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,120
you've got to give it a piece of logic

148
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,779
so you know if I see three failed login

149
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:53,150
attempts within 30 seconds followed by a

150
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,729
successful login attempt and I being

151
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,529
brute forced it's a very rudimentary

152
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:00,080
example but it gives you an idea now if

153
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,089
I know what that looks like I know what

154
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:05,719
bad looks like well the tool the magic

155
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:07,879
computers that we all purchase

156
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,729
well that can tell me when that happens

157
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:12,440
when it can't tell you is four tactics

158
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,180
and techniques that you don't know are

159
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,900
being used so well fireless malware

160
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,210
malware that executes in memory for

161
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,009
example using PowerShell well if I

162
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:23,870
didn't know to look for it why would I

163
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,569
have a control or some logic that says

164
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:29,240
look for this type of activity so this

165
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,710
is what people would refer to as an

166
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,990
unknown unknown I don't know if it's

167
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,789
there and I don't know what to look for

168
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:37,669
even if I did pretty difficult problem

169
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:39,979
this has started to be more recently

170
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:41,959
called threat hunting and it's a really

171
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,399
valuable thing to do which I'll get to

172
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,709
later

173
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:47,330
response and the automated an

174
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,639
orchestration component of this this is

175
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,289
fundamentally when you know there's a

176
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,629
problem what you do about it there's an

177
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:55,369
interesting argument around people that

178
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:57,050
work in this space that say if you have

179
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,679
no capability to respond to a problem

180
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:02,059
should you actually even bother looking

181
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:04,669
for it you know I've worked with many

182
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:06,319
customers where you know we'll turn on

183
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,599
these brilliant detective controls or do

184
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,240
some analysis someone gave you some of

185
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,429
your users behaved terribly and you know

186
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:15,439
they do this this and this and it's

187
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,679
opening all kinds of problems but the

188
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,800
business says we don't mind it's okay

189
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,689
we're not gonna go out and try to change

190
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:27,349
our culture and therefore it's fine okay

191
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:29,990
that's that cool but do I still want my

192
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,110
security analysts dealing with 30 alerts

193
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,569
a day for this behavior well no because

194
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:38,059
we know it's not good behavior but

195
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:40,099
somebody said we can't respond to it so

196
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:43,610
I'm going to turn it off maybe maybe not

197
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,519
it's an interesting debate so responsive

198
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,959
controls this could be into your

199
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,399
incident management process this could

200
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,379
be for forensics this could be all kinds

201
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:52,180
of things

202
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,619
now the automation and orchestration

203
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:57,319
component of this automation being

204
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,269
something that takes action without

205
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:03,050
intervention so ie I see a problem I

206
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,329
take an action and the human maybe just

207
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:06,829
gets told it's happened that's all

208
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:08,990
something it's automatic orchestration

209
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,550
possibly being the same thing but

210
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,829
involves user interaction usually so I'm

211
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:15,919
saying yes go and block an IP on the

212
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,619
firewall and a script is doing it

213
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:20,689
orchestration because the scripts going

214
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:22,279
and doing the action for me but I've

215
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,229
told it automation the script gets

216
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:26,089
automatically called and automatically

217
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:30,139
blocks said bad actor so hopefully that

218
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:32,229
just gives you a really quick

219
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:33,948
understanding of the types of

220
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:35,899
capabilities within a sock this isn't

221
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:37,399
all of them and this isn't some like

222
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,289
standard this is just a few bits and

223
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,589
pieces that pull together so to do most

224
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:46,160
of this stuff and sock a security

225
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,829
analysts they need tools they need tools

226
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,689
to use and these tools can look in many

227
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:52,670
different shapes and sizes but the one

228
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,149
I'm going to talk about is a seam so the

229
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:57,350
precursors to seam

230
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,720
we're sim or SEM and a scene was

231
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,780
essentially beer pulling it all together

232
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,780
I've put real-time in brackets because

233
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,000
except a few edge cases there's really

234
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,310
no such thing as true real-time

235
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,250
analytics because I have to wait for an

236
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,010
event or a metric to be generated have

237
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,950
to wait for it to be sent to something

238
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,750
that collects it I have to then wait for

239
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,700
that to be written to disk usually or

240
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,510
stored in memory and then need a CPU

241
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,970
cycle to run some logic against it and

242
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,860
then I need to get an alert now even

243
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,070
with really quick computes that could

244
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,340
still be minutes and that's usually the

245
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,650
best kind of case you're looking at most

246
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,300
of the stuff in a dweeb yes for example

247
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,870
and so VPC flow logs tons of their

248
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,550
authentication events you can have

249
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,680
between 5 and 20 minutes of delay before

250
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,880
you actually get the events are

251
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,040
something that's occurred and that's AWS

252
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,040
so when people talk about real-time

253
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,260
they're really meaning as close to

254
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,840
real-time as possible and you prioritize

255
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,940
that based on you know the value of the

256
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,720
data and then you know this data could

257
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,560
come from anywhere

258
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,150
essentially it just has to be machine

259
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,250
readable and it's going to get stored in

260
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,800
some kind of big data tool we use blunt

261
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,090
because this is we're partners with and

262
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,830
what we like but you know there's lots

263
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,240
of things out there it could be really

264
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,520
basic in a database but you need a way

265
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,830
of both storing it and accessing it so

266
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,140
when I run a search and I look for

267
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,640
something bad I've got to run that

268
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,560
search somewhere and of course the

269
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,380
panacea and the best possible solution

270
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,600
would essentially be a search engine

271
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,840
like Google but for my own machine data

272
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,070
and security relevant data so what seems

273
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:45,350
made up of these are kind of four areas

274
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,030
that I think are irrelevant to

275
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,270
understand about seem so the fundamental

276
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,220
thing on the bottom is integration so I

277
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,450
want to be out of pulling as much data

278
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,610
as possible from as many disparate log

279
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,890
sources as possible I want to be able to

280
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,870
extend it out so make sure I'm

281
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,390
interacting with other tool sets so you

282
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,570
know if my shop uses JIRA or ServiceNow

283
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,600
or Excel to manage their tickets I want

284
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,580
to make sure that my scene can talk to

285
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,120
it and

286
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,390
update it and so on we then move up to

287
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,920
frameworks and a frameworks are really

288
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,720
important so that we do things in a

289
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,180
programmatic and repeatable way so this

290
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,800
could be where some of your processes

291
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,839
are represented in code this could also

292
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,130
be where you do things like risk

293
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,950
assessment an example of that when mixed

294
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,339
with context is if we have let's say a

295
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,170
phishing campaign go out to all of our

296
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,529
staff and we have let's say 6% of people

297
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,839
click on the link now the stocks getting

298
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:41,900
inundated hopefully with alert that this

299
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,060
activity happened how do we start to

300
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,700
prioritize it well we need context and

301
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,850
that context starts with orehu because

302
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,550
there is a difference between perhaps a

303
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,710
cleaner who just has an account to log

304
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,170
in to update their rotor to the chief

305
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,839
financial officer if both of them have

306
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,910
Merrill on their machine the impact that

307
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,529
could have to your organization is night

308
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,830
and day they're both security events

309
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,140
they're both important but one is

310
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,370
something that you should be screaming

311
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,690
about and one is something that you've

312
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,250
probably deal with later on when it

313
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,950
comes to a big incident and so context

314
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,110
within the seam within something that

315
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,089
enables to give you that understanding

316
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:22,459
of criticality that's really important

317
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:25,430
the other is of course asset what

318
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,029
machines are they ok so this machine has

319
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:30,980
no one logged in but some other malware

320
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,580
alerts

321
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,880
who owns it is it the sigh so is it a

322
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,350
contractor who's got no access to

323
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,630
anything is it even our device and how

324
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,520
are we getting the logs from it so you

325
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,550
know understanding what you've got and

326
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,130
who should be on them really important

327
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,830
for context and then finally that

328
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,870
analytics layer that's fundamental and

329
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,550
from a tooling perspective is just the

330
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,920
ability to query the data now we

331
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,630
obviously want it to be at scale we want

332
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,730
it to be able to deal with you know

333
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,990
terabytes if not petabytes of data per

334
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,850
day and so on and so forth but that's

335
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,380
kind of out of scope of this talk but

336
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,660
you know fundamentally you want

337
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,890
something that enables you to collect

338
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,010
data store it and and make it accessible

339
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,959
to the end-user which is usually going

340
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,790
to be a security analyst threat hunter

341
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,320
etc so before I kind of move on to the

342
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,510
problem that some people face with this

343
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,970
are there any questions about kind of

344
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,899
the basic foundations of sock

345
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,180
and sock using sim because I realized

346
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,680
that it's a lot to cover in a short

347
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,990
period of time so any initial questions

348
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,670
on just the Safin sim part cool it's in

349
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,139
here because if I consider it kind of

350
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:38,279
foundational knowledge to the next

351
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,749
points I'm going to talk about so

352
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:40,860
hopefully it's given you a bit of a

353
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,929
foundation and if you already knew it

354
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:47,160
well if had you memory refreshed so both

355
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,800
the research and evidence from some of

356
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,269
the customers have worked with though is

357
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:52,949
that the problem is is that some socks

358
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:56,309
are actually quite ineffective true to

359
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:59,459
false positive ratio one to 110 and this

360
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:03,300
was based on some research done by cloud

361
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,480
security alliance this essentially means

362
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,519
that if you have that Detective control

363
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,160
that rule in your seam for example and

364
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,439
it tells you there is a threat there is

365
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:16,529
a problem something bad has happened it

366
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:21,029
only turns out to be true bad one in a

367
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:24,119
hundred and ten times and that I have

368
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:27,720
heard from people both locally and in

369
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,850
London who've you know run their private

370
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,110
shops inside their businesses have told

371
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,249
me that that's actually a pretty good

372
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:36,360
number and I say oh so I only did the

373
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,040
one that is actually research-based but

374
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,540
I've been told by many people that

375
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,439
that's actually oh that's good well done

376
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:45,990
okay if you say so so what does that

377
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,639
mean well what that means is that you're

378
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,290
probably getting quite low value

379
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,809
returned if that is your if that's the

380
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,120
best ratio or at least the average

381
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,759
that's that's quite low value and I mean

382
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,709
that in the sense of if you're paying

383
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:01,740
for let's say a team of ten analysts

384
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,209
they've gone to great universities

385
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,370
obviously in Scotland to get their

386
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,809
ethical hacking degrees or their

387
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:08,040
computer networking degrees and so on

388
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,110
and you've then employed them and train

389
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,819
them and you've put them on sans courses

390
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:13,139
and you've trained them in computers

391
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,509
forensics you've then sat them on a tool

392
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:16,980
it's gonna tell them when the bad

393
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,329
happens so that they can do something

394
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:21,049
about it and they're sitting there and

395
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:24,360
109 times they're going false positive

396
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,799
ah it's not problem false positive no

397
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:31,110
it's not problem false positive it's not

398
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,230
really a problem and how long do you

399
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,910
think it is until that person is pretty

400
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,790
much in Auto false-positive mode

401
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,110
because humans are really good with

402
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,880
patterns we pick them up very quickly

403
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,520
and if we're going false positive false

404
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,740
positive false positive false positive

405
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,750
Day party weekend false positive false

406
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,270
positive false positive for cyan oh man

407
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,360
- Papa's it what's that

408
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,160
oops and these things happen they've

409
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,660
happened in socks we've run where you

410
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,020
just get fatigued you just get tired so

411
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,910
you get tired of essentially being a

412
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,820
helpdesk for IT you know low-hanging

413
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,030
fruit stuff that's very rarely have has

414
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,680
much value or impact to the organization

415
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,770
and it's not to say oh well you should

416
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,660
just wipe out all those rules and that

417
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,550
kind of work because you don't want to

418
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,430
miss that one but you do want to try to

419
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,730
minimize the hundred and ten and we'll

420
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,580
get to that a little bit so analyst

421
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,460
fatigue very closely tied into that I

422
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,260
think I worked an assault my background

423
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,480
of uni was I was a senior security

424
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,700
analyst that moved in to kind of instant

425
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,070
management and security engineering and

426
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,470
now consultant and you know I I felt I

427
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,420
got RSI from copy and pasting

428
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,300
screenshots into Excel because it was at

429
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,590
the time it was a sock that was

430
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,420
up-and-coming and thankfully they've

431
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,370
moved away from that now but you know it

432
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,160
was it was pretty basic work and at the

433
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,960
time it was valuable to that individual

434
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,970
customer and that business because we

435
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,420
were doing compliance but fortunately

436
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,800
socks have moved on now to less

437
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,810
compliance focused and more threat focus

438
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,300
ie how can we actually reduce the risk

439
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,220
of the organization or help them deal

440
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,199
with breaches and threats and so on be

441
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,430
actual defenders

442
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,579
so anyway analyst fatigue leads to

443
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,359
complacency least er possibly boredom so

444
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,069
their final one and one that you know we

445
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,839
get told about a lot in the media and

446
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,800
then within four SEC within our

447
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,959
universities and schools is as a talent

448
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,970
shortage not only of you know

449
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,650
individuals themselves but individuals

450
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,930
with the right skill sets for us to to

451
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,950
work with and bring into our

452
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,630
organizations defenders to train up but

453
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,600
when we get those people and if we take

454
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,240
into account the previous two points how

455
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,880
long is it until they move on we put

456
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,730
them on tanker and sans course amazing

457
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,170
there now they come back and then I'm

458
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,850
ready I am so ready

459
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,690
but could you close down this

460
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,479
500 tickets first how long is it until

461
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:59,409
that individual goes either I'm out in

462
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:01,269
which case all that investments gone and

463
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:05,139
you've lost a great person or how long

464
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:08,229
is it until they forget because you know

465
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:09,879
our brains do not remember things

466
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:11,799
perfectly we have to hone our skills we

467
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,539
have to practice them is why CTF cylon

468
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,519
tomorrow so critical because they keep

469
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,139
things fresh even if we're not

470
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:20,739
necessarily doing in our day job so that

471
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:22,419
is the problem as I see it that is not

472
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:24,940
the only problem in many socks and in

473
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,889
industry but this is again I'm just

474
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,599
trying yeah focused further and further

475
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:32,919
down so what's one thing I that we can

476
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:36,159
do to improve on this and when I say

477
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,169
improve on it I mean well how do we

478
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:40,899
improve are true to false positive for

479
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:42,399
issue how do we get less and less

480
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:45,009
fatigue well we make the work more

481
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:47,950
interesting and hopefully of better

482
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:52,779
value to the organization and this is

483
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:56,830
about changing priorities right reactive

484
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:00,279
is when something occurs and someone

485
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:02,590
usually screams at you whether it's a

486
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,239
computer or human and then you do

487
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,259
something about it

488
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:07,659
prior to this going out and looking for

489
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:09,190
the problem in the first place whether

490
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,289
that's looking for a gap in your

491
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:13,599
defenses looking for a gap in your

492
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,879
detective controls ie yeah but if we are

493
00:19:15,879 --> 00:19:18,070
breached how would we know and it's also

494
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,869
about threat hunting and looking for the

495
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:21,279
threats that are probably already there

496
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,549
and so I found this graphic on Google as

497
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:28,599
all good talks will and I just I loved

498
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,580
what it looks like because although your

499
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,259
security analyst is hopefully don't have

500
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:34,720
their feet up on the desk they often are

501
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,399
just waiting for the computer to tell

502
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:38,940
them to do something and that is

503
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,759
relatively low value when actually in on

504
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:45,899
a night shifts low number of tickets

505
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:48,039
shouldn't they be empowered to go in

506
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:51,159
experiment to go in find threats that

507
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:53,229
are out there to report in to place

508
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:54,639
their masters course they've just

509
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:57,009
finished or their that you know this

510
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:58,899
thing they've done a CBT Nuggets or the

511
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:00,279
hack yourself first course they've just

512
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:02,529
learnt about to go and actually look for

513
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:04,899
problems and that's certainly the

514
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:06,340
argument are making

515
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,430
so let's say right now that we have

516
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,130
agreed and we want to change priorities

517
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,170
well we now need to actually maybe come

518
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,520
up with a bit of a methodology because

519
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,050
you don't just go right guys start

520
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,940
googling for threats in your environment

521
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,030
and look for stuff okay I didn't find

522
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,390
anything

523
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,590
oh okay try again

524
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,420
didn't find anything again just keep

525
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,320
going you'll find something eventually

526
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,130
okay No so we want a bit of a

527
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,760
methodology enter oder just my favourite

528
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,850
word it's not word so you de observe

529
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,400
orient decide act as I mentioned earlier

530
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,650
this was coined first by Thea I think it

531
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,410
was a general but fundamentally this was

532
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,930
fighter pilots in it one of the world

533
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,540
wars which escaped me and what they

534
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,890
realized was that the fighter pilots

535
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,100
were applying their training quite

536
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,240
rigorously quite sequentially quite

537
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,410
right you do this then you do this then

538
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,020
you do this but half years you probably

539
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,640
guess being a fighter pilot means things

540
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,590
change quite quickly

541
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,540
not only the orientation to the earth

542
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,180
but the Messiah or the guns that are

543
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,250
hitting you the fuel that's leaking so

544
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,840
on and so forth it's a very very

545
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,050
fast-moving job when it's live and so

546
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,850
what they developed was you don't I said

547
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,400
right okay just start what's going on

548
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,040
I am currently flying towards the ground

549
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,990
okay interesting worrying yourself to it

550
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,060
I mean well how does that affect your

551
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,160
you and your plane probably going to die

552
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,660
okay wait you knew I'm probably gonna

553
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,850
pull up good cool when oh sure Prater

554
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,720
now yes do it right now so the

555
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,800
interesting thing with something like

556
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,470
odor is it's irrelevant without the act

557
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:55,120
and again in security incidents when

558
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,980
you're trying to contain a breach when

559
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,720
you're hunting for threats as a security

560
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,240
analyst or threat hunter etc without the

561
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,060
act apart all you've done is found a

562
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,250
problem and talked about a possible

563
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,380
solution or work around until you act

564
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,940
have you actually delivered any real

565
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,320
value to the business you're trying to

566
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,330
protect

567
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,820
and so the reason I've kind of called

568
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,500
out the detective and responsive element

569
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,270
is to put it in more kind of security

570
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,780
context is there about detecting there's

571
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,580
a problem and understanding its impact

572
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,890
to you individually as possibly an

573
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,020
individual or your business and then the

574
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,760
response is working out well what do we

575
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,120
do about it and then doing it now I

576
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,100
couldn't talk about you defer defense

577
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,840
without mentioning that attack is kind

578
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,710
of cottoned on to this very early on

579
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,540
because they use doodle all the time as

580
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,400
any pen tester red teamer will tell you

581
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,210
booter is essentially their entire life

582
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,350
because what they're doing and mapping

583
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,370
that obviously to the kill chain is

584
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,550
always looking for to gather information

585
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,930
changing their approach seeing how it

586
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,700
impacts them changing their approach

587
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,220
seeing how it impacts them you know Stu

588
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,810
mentioned earlier on you know he's all

589
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:10,140
was almost caught three times but he

590
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,030
didn't just keep with the same story and

591
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,880
and I know from him telling me more and

592
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,930
more about a story you didn't just wear

593
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,260
the same color top guy in a red jumper

594
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,230
it's now when a blue jumper cuz people

595
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,670
remember primary kill is really easily

596
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,070
you know because he changed cuz he went

597
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,320
I am under threats of being detected I

598
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,840
am gonna observe orient myself to it I'm

599
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,980
gonna make a decision I'm gonna go into

600
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,230
the bathroom new jumper on and I'm out

601
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,840
and I'm no longer at risk or less risk

602
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,350
so I'm not gonna say this is a good

603
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,120
thing necessarily but it helps you

604
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,920
understand how this is not like some

605
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,930
magical new process or way of thinking

606
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,630
it was just simply a basic methodology

607
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,790
to just remember that it's not just

608
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,040
about you know reading and getting a

609
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,210
threat list of 20,000 bad hashes but are

610
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,230
they relevant to your business do you

611
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,730
collect hashes how you gonna compare

612
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,060
them to anything useless can't oh we can

613
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,880
okay that's useful okay well let's see

614
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,260
what they come up with but we've got

615
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,300
some some bad systems who got some

616
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,220
systems running software that was in

617
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,780
that that look up okay

618
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,950
what I'm gonna do about it now don't

619
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,010
worry about it be fine I think - be

620
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,290
something about it okay let's act and so

621
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,640
on and so forth and attackers are doing

622
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,490
the same thing and this is of course now

623
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,550
where we go well so in familiar with you

624
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,610
Deb

625
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,460
let's now apply throughout hunting to it

626
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,500
and threat hunting is essentially luda

627
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,770
methodology just zooming in a bit more

628
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,090
and the interesting thing with threat

629
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,650
hunting is it's fundamentally the

630
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,870
scientific methods it's a fairly

631
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,420
straightforward in that context you know

632
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,580
you come up with an idea or hypothesis

633
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,560
and that could be based on experience it

634
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,320
could be based on gut feeling it could

635
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,480
be based on research actual you know

636
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,920
hardcore research you could have read a

637
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,990
white paper seen some in our conference

638
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,700
and then you go back to your environment

639
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,500
you go yeah

640
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,960
they mentioned this thing and yeah it's

641
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,240
really weird you know they killed it I

642
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,520
think was a turtle blue and they said

643
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,350
that yeah that loads of people actually

644
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,900
had SMB version one still enabled on

645
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,880
their parameter firewalls couldn't

646
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,140
possibly like we wouldn't have that

647
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,960
would we you know what I might I might

648
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,050
check and I might see if I can do some

649
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,090
research internally and figure out maybe

650
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,340
maybe we vulnerable you maybe speak to

651
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,810
the network team and they go I'm gonna

652
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,790
know we've got we've got laughs we've

653
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,400
got ids/ips we've got firewalls next-gen

654
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,070
firewalls even better future gen files

655
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,660
around the corner by the way they're

656
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,140
gonna be incredible and they go you know

657
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,340
what actually we don't have any logs

658
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,140
from I'm from two firewalls when it

659
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,910
comes to configuration

660
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:47,620
ie is smb1 enabled or not no oh could we

661
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,530
get it and this is where you're

662
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,330
investigating right tools and techniques

663
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:56,020
what does you got I have got SFTP my

664
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,400
technique Hugh's I'm going to pull off

665
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,980
the a sa configuration to find out what

666
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,510
my parameter firewalls are configured

667
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,350
okay and did you uncover anything okay

668
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,780
and now this is something that I will go

669
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,060
into a little bit more but you do not

670
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,420
always uncover anything other than that

671
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,240
you were wrong just like true science

672
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,970
right people have published entire

673
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,930
successful PhDs on saying totally wrong

674
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,200
don't do it this way because that's the

675
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,860
whole point

676
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,170
your contribution isn't that you

677
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,450
suddenly win a Nobel Prize for an ax

678
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,610
major new discovery your contribution is

679
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,000
I took an approach I validated that it

680
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,860
was a good approach but it turned out

681
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,230
the approach does not lead to a cure for

682
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:41,910
count

683
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:45,340
so all the other cancer researchers in

684
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,310
the future don't do that that is

685
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,280
valuable and that is a PhD great well

686
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,410
done and it's the same in threat hunting

687
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,470
your outcome your uncovering of

688
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,690
something could be to uncover that

689
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,180
you've got completely wrong and that is

690
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,100
still valuable and should also still be

691
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,890
considered to be wrong rewarded

692
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,990
you shouldn't grade your throw hunters

693
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,670
on the amount of threats defined you

694
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,200
should grade them on their rigor of

695
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,780
their documentation their approach and

696
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,480
that they learn because this is a cycle

697
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,510
and so that informative rich is exactly

698
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,730
that you've got to actually take the

699
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,920
information you uncover and put it back

700
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,990
into something into a system of some

701
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,510
form it could be one note it could be

702
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,880
Evernote it could be a dedicated threat

703
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,950
hunting platform could be chair don't

704
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,960
care but it's got to go somewhere and

705
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,750
then as part of your process when you're

706
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,270
creating your hypothesis you review

707
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,210
results of previous attempts right you

708
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,370
look at the data you do a really quick

709
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,320
little review essentially and then you

710
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,320
proceed and then of course the thing

711
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,310
that we're actually trying to do is

712
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,520
disrupt because if we've got an active

713
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,960
attack we want to stop them taking their

714
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,000
actions on their objectives exfiltrating

715
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,240
data destroying our network etc there's

716
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,260
to kind of frame it in a slightly

717
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,880
different way we're trying to

718
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,020
essentially figure out new ways to

719
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,270
either discover that threats or our

720
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,330
network or disrupt them and they are

721
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,070
trying to figure out how to get around

722
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,960
any of those detection and make it so

723
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,000
you can't disrupt them and this is a

724
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,440
cat-and-mouse game that we all play

725
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,510
every day in different ways but it's

726
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,800
especially important when you're

727
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,870
thinking about threat hunting because as

728
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,060
soon as you put in a new use case and

729
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,070
you detective control you're attacking

730
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,960
goes-o

731
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,760
you detective control over there all

732
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,470
right let's do some let's do some

733
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,870
proof-of-concept stuff okay let's pull

734
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,000
the are the publish that code and rules

735
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,920
and get up that was nice of them so

736
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,510
let's apply them in our test environment

737
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,140
and work our way around them yeah

738
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,830
there's a reason

739
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,390
while there's multiple reasons but one

740
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,860
of the reasons that you know windows for

741
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,690
such a long time had such a bad rep for

742
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,240
being attacked by malware is because it

743
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,600
is the market leader buy that 97% so Who

744
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,340
am I going to attack another attack

745
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,160
Apple devices not gonna get anyone gonna

746
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,510
attack Windows devices because they're

747
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:08,530
everywhere and so you know they're argue

748
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,550
with me about security of their

749
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,590
platforms because we'll be here forever

750
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,690
but the point being you know they're

751
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,220
gonna go and they're going to modify it

752
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,990
they're going to iterate just like we

753
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:22,450
would and so and I found this actually

754
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,650
late late last night which is when the

755
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,059
slider added so they asked me to explain

756
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:27,640
all of it but if you've got your Buddha

757
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,650
cycle which is the bottom right which is

758
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,610
your hunting so to speak the the

759
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,620
interaction and the integration of this

760
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,940
of all the parts of your security

761
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,400
posture your security team become

762
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,050
critical this isn't a thing to do in

763
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,840
isolation your response over there right

764
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,900
is fundamentally you try to stop bad

765
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,179
from continuing to happen and you to

766
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:51,100
recover from it and then of course your

767
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,950
intelligence is well how do we enrich

768
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,809
other things so if I find something

769
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:58,840
that's bad or maybe potentially bad do I

770
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,460
just keep it in isolation that I only

771
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,500
apply to my searches and my controls now

772
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,390
I share it with the team if we're part

773
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,190
of a larger entity maybe we share it

774
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,640
with FS Isaac etc and try and get out to

775
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,620
the community maybe you do a talk on it

776
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,150
whatever but you know you should share

777
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:16,570
it and something when when you start to

778
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,790
look at the the breadth so to speak of

779
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,700
this you also realize that this isn't

780
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,400
novel this isn't particularly new

781
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,530
security people around the world doing

782
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,790
things like threat hunting shouldn't be

783
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:30,010
going you know we're we're using agile

784
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,600
in a way now and as soon as we find

785
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,670
something we create a change ticking and

786
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,950
it's great and put a life cycle and

787
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,960
going like pretty sure developers have

788
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,670
been doing that for a while they just

789
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,610
call it something else and and again

790
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,770
this is a busy diagram and you can plain

791
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,990
Gartner for that but this is all about

792
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,860
just embedding security within your

793
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,700
development operations and I'm not

794
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,200
getting too app set her up development

795
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,820
here because this can actually be

796
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,770
applied to security operation sensors

797
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,270
because every time you find bad you

798
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,880
should be trying to change something

799
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,150
right if I find that there is malware on

800
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,960
all of our endpoints well that means

801
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,720
that controls all over my estate have

802
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,320
failed

803
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,990
was it the security awareness control

804
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,399
did they not complete their training was

805
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,549
our training crap is our AV not next-gen

806
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:21,679
enough and we need more of the next-gen

807
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,570
in our AV to stop it coming on to their

808
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,669
endpoint do we need better laughs better

809
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:27,740
things so on and so forth so the Sox

810
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,789
should always be trying to inflect

811
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:31,090
change within the organization but also

812
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,830
internally and that's what we're gonna

813
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:38,029
get to next so for the sake of argument

814
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:40,399
we've been on some successful hunts and

815
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,200
we have detected an advanced persistent

816
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,299
threat and our network and we've managed

817
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:46,159
to get them out and played them out

818
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,840
because we're amazing at what we do and

819
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,399
our organization supports us a hundred

820
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:53,000
percent we go well we've just uncovered

821
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,020
like five new ways that they got in okay

822
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,309
awesome

823
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:01,190
so we've maybe may change tickets and

824
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,899
we've told people are you gonna need to

825
00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:04,690
invest in this new type of technology or

826
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,309
whatever okay and they they're go away

827
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:08,360
and do those projects but in the

828
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,299
meantime well you don't just want to

829
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:12,950
have to repeatedly hunt for the same

830
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,409
thing that's what computers are good at

831
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:17,480
doing right and this is where your seam

832
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,779
comes on board so you're gonna say well

833
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:24,110
I was able to detect this a B to apt via

834
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,730
the following log sources hashes TTP's

835
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,919
right and I'm gonna create a new use

836
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:33,140
case in the use case generically

837
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,820
speaking it's just a way of using a

838
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,190
thing and in this context is creating a

839
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,909
new rule correlation baseline etc okay

840
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:43,909
so if you stay with me we're in a sock

841
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:46,549
we found Bad's and we've figured out how

842
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:47,539
to detect it

843
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:48,890
so we want to detective that ever

844
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,740
happens again because all the controls

845
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,360
are still the same as they were when it

846
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,919
got in the first time because the

847
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:58,610
project's not finished up yet okay so I

848
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,940
go into my seam going to my tooling and

849
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,710
I go I want to edit this rule and I edit

850
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,529
the rule and I save it not in any

851
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:08,029
enterprise because when you change

852
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:09,980
control because what if you change it

853
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,080
wrong you could take out all of our

854
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,090
detection and we've got like a thousand

855
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,640
rules oh sorry guys so I can't do that

856
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,990
so I've got to do

857
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,760
oh okay so we need to change ticket okay

858
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,640
done that we need to deploy it into dev

859
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,160
okay you need to generate some dev data

860
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,490
make validate it it works amazing okay

861
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,760
we're now two days three days in okay

862
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,860
awesome I want to push this into

863
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,380
pre-production to test it as scale test

864
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,630
it in a like production environment okay

865
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,679
cool

866
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,210
the next window is much ok that's fine

867
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,470
that's three weeks away we can wait

868
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,880
three weeks okay so now in

869
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,299
pre-production test it works good job

870
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:52,940
because you used dev properly and you

871
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,299
now want to push into production but the

872
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:57,590
problem is last time things got pushed

873
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,299
to production in actually took out the

874
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:01,880
wrong rule they added a zero and instead

875
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,140
of looking for ten failed logins

876
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,210
followed by a successful login they

877
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,620
looked for a hundred so it never

878
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,659
triggered so now it has to be signed off

879
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,790
by senior senior manager who will

880
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,489
validate your logic before it goes in

881
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:15,109
there on holiday for two weeks

882
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:16,639
and you can't even get the change record

883
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,590
approved until they for Eyre and check

884
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,560
it ok wait for them to come back they

885
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,330
check it they say good work did a great

886
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,449
job you get your change window and it's

887
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:29,510
pushed in amazing you now have all the

888
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,100
way from the you know the results of

889
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,690
your new detective controls in

890
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,949
production but how long did that take in

891
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,449
many organizations especially ones that

892
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:40,489
heavily regulated and heavily regulated

893
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:42,469
for good reason that could be a month

894
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:45,469
and for that entire month are you

895
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,879
manually running your hunt every day

896
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,440
just to make sure that a PT's not come

897
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,030
back probably not are you hoping they

898
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,710
didn't come back doesn't sound like a

899
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,660
great idea and this is where change

900
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,700
comes in and this is where what I would

901
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,310
call you know either your change stack

902
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,170
or changes code becomes really important

903
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,380
because what you have to do to get

904
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,940
support to change systems more

905
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,460
frequently is you have to show them how

906
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,220
safe it is to change it and you do that

907
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,810
by connecting things like your change

908
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,640
system the change record your tickets

909
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,130
with your actual source code your

910
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,950
configuration so this is an example

911
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,830
pulled from something that we did and we

912
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:31,490
use so these two also use danceable as a

913
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,410
configuration management tool so this is

914
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,570
a thing that looks at files and says I'm

915
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,200
going to do

916
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,589
in this order for you it's great use it

917
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:41,260
for hardening boxes for example and

918
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,910
every hour it will log into a Linux

919
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,859
server and say are you still security

920
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:49,220
hardened against the CIS benchmark for

921
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,910
CentOS six and it'll go yes I am okay

922
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,510
just check in or if it finds out that

923
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,549
it's no longer harden because maybe

924
00:35:58,549 --> 00:35:59,900
someone pushed some code that changed

925
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,240
some configuration some SELinux ii

926
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,599
settings whatever it will go hold on I

927
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:07,640
told you you need to have selinux

928
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,049
enabled with the following policy oh

929
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:09,589
sorry

930
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:11,450
changed it thank you so it's an

931
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,880
automation and orchestration engine

932
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,170
docker

933
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:17,299
is a containerization tool in this

934
00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:19,339
example we didn't really use it

935
00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:20,569
correctly we essentially used it is

936
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:22,339
really lightweight and transferable the

937
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:24,890
ends because we weren't actually

938
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,470
building code but anyway we used it to

939
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,089
great effect and we use git lab for

940
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:30,680
version control version control if

941
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,480
you've ever used Microsoft Word is track

942
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,049
changes on steroids and it's great so

943
00:36:36,049 --> 00:36:39,650
this is how we used it to and this is

944
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,900
bringing our seam under all of this I

945
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,780
should probably have opened with that so

946
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,680
if you set up a tool supported by all of

947
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,020
this technology now I can see

948
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,000
programmatically exactly what's changing

949
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,670
where and I can roll it back in seconds

950
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,190
as opposed to incredible long change

951
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,220
windows back out plans you know massive

952
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,809
backups have to be taken first because

953
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:05,299
it's so dangerous and we don't touch it

954
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:08,630
it might fall over this way and I think

955
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,450
we got to a change from dev to

956
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,790
production with still approvals thus

957
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,640
once the approval was ticked it was 20

958
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,369
minutes straight through some automated

959
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:21,650
testing it's great so the sock we're

960
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,790
able to put a new rule into production

961
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:28,670
really quickly and so yeah so identify

962
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,950
environment so dev pre-production all

963
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:34,790
the same all kept in check we eliminate

964
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,799
fear driven development so some of our

965
00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:38,150
security analysts we're really quite

966
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,670
worried about you know making changes of

967
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,609
course because we had somebody in that

968
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:46,640
example of adding a zero to the amount

969
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,880
of login fields not a good day but

970
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,160
anyway happens so but this way so can

971
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,450
you make mistakes because if you make a

972
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:56,270
mistake just roll it back and the system

973
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,640
itself makes somebody else check your

974
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,760
code quickly it can be a peer but you've

975
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,150
got that peer check

976
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,980
this meant that so we took away

977
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,770
everyone's access to production back-end

978
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,510
so no one could edit anything in

979
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,110
production

980
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,240
full-stop not even the admins there was

981
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,180
no way except no there was no way except

982
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,800
with a break last account to login to

983
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,290
pre prod or production servers we took

984
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:23,750
away ever and SSH keys one day and they

985
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,360
were like what right well yep and so we

986
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,860
should be doing it so answer balls keys

987
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,390
were the only ones on those servers and

988
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,970
you had to make your changes in dev

989
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,160
commit it into version control and then

990
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,010
it would do it for you and by

991
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,380
essentially removing the option of

992
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,320
manual changes it essentially protected

993
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,000
the system but also got people into the

994
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,990
workflow that we were trying to put in

995
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,350
place one means a disaster recovery so

996
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:50,360
infrastructure is code so this was all

997
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,520
built in AWS for example and we could

998
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,740
just get ansible to rebuild it I mean

999
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,350
you might lose the data but all the

1000
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,210
configuration all the rules all the

1001
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,070
access controls everything the hardening

1002
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:03,380
of the servers we could literally clone

1003
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,600
the whole thing from school just build

1004
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,580
it from scratch like for like just

1005
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:11,060
missing the data it's really cool and

1006
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,850
security driven so this was more about

1007
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,560
keys so I'm not going to deep dive about

1008
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,140
that and but in our so all of our source

1009
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,970
code was on git lab interesting thing

1010
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,250
about source code they love credentials

1011
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,990
because they need to do things in an

1012
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,300
authenticated way and so we had to store

1013
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,640
a ton of secrets but you don't want to

1014
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,310
store plaintext secrets in any kind of

1015
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,720
version control because it's there

1016
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,990
forever in your history and plaintext

1017
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:38,750
very naughty but at the same time if we

1018
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,700
encrypt it how do we get the system to

1019
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,730
automatically decrypt it and ANSP always

1020
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,530
got a great free tool for this good

1021
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,660
ansible volt so we essentially have

1022
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,450
ansible

1023
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,570
encode and encrypt so encrypt the data

1024
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,580
before it's written into get and then

1025
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,950
ansible decrypt sit at deploy

1026
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:02,120
so the code stays the same it was really

1027
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,450
cool when we kind of used

1028
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,430
like we have absolutely no secrets in

1029
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:11,790
plain text anywhere really cool look

1030
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,780
like this so top line on dev environment

1031
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,580
or built in containers so an individual

1032
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,140
engineer like myself could pull down the

1033
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,900
codebase say run it dev it would spin up

1034
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,690
five dr. oz containers and by seam

1035
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,030
clustered and built and everything was

1036
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,700
there with my production configuration

1037
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,290
not production data but production

1038
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,940
configuration completely like-for-like

1039
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,550
because we could only promote up from

1040
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,040
dev to pre prod to prod you couldn't

1041
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,040
promote that round right again by

1042
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,960
stopping that you stopped getting out of

1043
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,070
sync and out of control

1044
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,940
it made sure that dev pre prod and prod

1045
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,950
were always identical unless you are

1046
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,720
making a change but you've changed hat

1047
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,850
to start a dev be pushed into

1048
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,410
pre-production and then pushed into

1049
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,390
production so that's where a lot like in

1050
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,730
dev pre-production much simpler because

1051
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,170
we don't use containers we don't have to

1052
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,900
kind of bootstrap some stuff but you'll

1053
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,830
notice at the first step for

1054
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,860
pre-production and production hardening

1055
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,330
are you still secure for me to actually

1056
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,590
publish code to you in the first place

1057
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:17,100
I'm totally still secure okay then it's

1058
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,470
allowed okay and maybe not that secure

1059
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,480
well no code for you unless you get

1060
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,220
hardened again and that's that worked so

1061
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,600
that this was just really interesting

1062
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,280
for us so we're not kind of you know a

1063
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,620
dev house at all we don't typically do

1064
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,570
product development we don't really have

1065
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,310
any developers this was just done by me

1066
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:38,940
in some engineers and we kind of you

1067
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,780
know really didn't know much about

1068
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,120
DevOps either you know we used that Jan

1069
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,650
some of our projects but their ops

1070
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,720
itself and some of the tooling it was

1071
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,110
really new for us and so being able to

1072
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,240
kind of pull this together and bear in

1073
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,770
mind I'm linking all this way back up to

1074
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,080
the sock to the hunter to the hunter

1075
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,790
wanting to actually push something in

1076
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,990
and so on and so on and so on

1077
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,490
I realize it's a long journey we've been

1078
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:02,940
on this was the kind of the end point of

1079
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,540
the projects and what worked this wasn't

1080
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,210
perfect we we still had some kind of

1081
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,980
bugs at the end that we wanted to fix

1082
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,350
and improve upon but it did mean a

1083
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:16,080
massive change to the way that we run

1084
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,490
that particular sock

1085
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,860
because again rather than you know it

1086
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,150
taking weeks and weeks and weeks and

1087
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,920
that was in a really pretty small soft

1088
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,150
small organization we're there to prove

1089
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,650
things quickly it still took weeks to

1090
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,570
get code into production where's this

1091
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,060
way we could show the track record all

1092
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,880
all source controlled and you know what

1093
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,770
if you made a mistake you know that

1094
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,590
commit that made the mistake that's got

1095
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,480
the extra zero in it okay

1096
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,690
let's fix it twenty minutes fixed done

1097
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,850
but it's again it's not just been hot

1098
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,900
fixed you're not just locked into

1099
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,060
production up just SSH in and change

1100
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,610
that in case no notice that's fine you

1101
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,740
have to go through yep got a it's got to

1102
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,570
be approved but it then it's

1103
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,810
programmatically distributed so bringing

1104
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,930
it all back to the sock and this is math

1105
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:05,670
side ish it's a bit market II but I just

1106
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,670
really liked pretty pictures yeah so the

1107
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,200
idea being that your sock has moved from

1108
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,670
this place of quite quite a lot of

1109
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,480
inefficiency

1110
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,960
you know this those but a nice fatigue

1111
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,820
and so on but instead you're actually

1112
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,200
kind of moving away from that you're

1113
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,030
moving into the hunting space looking

1114
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,920
for control gaps either in your

1115
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,750
prevention detection or response and

1116
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,850
then actually being given the tools to

1117
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:28,619
make those changes yourself not in all

1118
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:32,970
cases but ideally in some saw so down

1119
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,410
there I've not really mentioned and I'm

1120
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:35,700
not going to other than to say that

1121
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,680
security orchestration automation and

1122
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,869
response it's a relatively new area of

1123
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:41,520
technology where it's trying to

1124
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,950
essentially make it really easy for you

1125
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,380
to make changes not in the sock but

1126
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,150
outside the sock so automatically

1127
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:50,570
blacklisting ip's when you see them bad

1128
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,040
automatically taking actions within your

1129
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,330
environment or pulling in virustotal

1130
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:59,580
information that kind of thing yeah the

1131
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,980
couple of final things on that is fail

1132
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,609
fast and fail safe some very interesting

1133
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:07,200
concepts that I just learnt about when

1134
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,750
going through this process very much

1135
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,270
failing fast means if you're making

1136
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:14,130
changes quickly then you know what

1137
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:17,040
failed quickly if you do one big blowout

1138
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,720
at the end of a six-month project and

1139
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,790
you deploy a thousand changes and it

1140
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,859
doesn't work you're having a terrible

1141
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:27,810
terrible Christmas it happens you know

1142
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,760
it never do a big production change

1143
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,380
before Christmas you're guaranteed

1144
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,850
ruin your day and and failsafe because

1145
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,800
with the roots alive one failed in pre

1146
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,480
prod perfect that's exactly what good

1147
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,350
should have failed in death because

1148
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,060
there should be as like-for-like as

1149
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,400
possible but hey propose dare to do that

1150
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,480
to stress test etc and then the the

1151
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,710
other one was just making everyone a

1152
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:55,290
creator it sounds a little bit lanky but

1153
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:58,650
you know when it comes to a sock again

1154
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:00,540
people are often seen as essentially

1155
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,210
security helpdesk technicians and that's

1156
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,410
not what they are it's not what they've

1157
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,420
trained to be what they've trained to be

1158
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,970
is problem solvers and ideally do you

1159
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,410
know defenders people that understand

1160
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:13,080
you know elements of their domain and

1161
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,150
they try to use those skills to better

1162
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,700
your organization so give them tools

1163
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,370
that equip them to actually go and help

1164
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,560
your organization so that's reducing its

1165
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,530
risk identifying threats and overall

1166
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,870
hopefully protecting you from things

1167
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:29,550
like you know the big farms are talking

1168
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:31,500
about this G was talking about actually

1169
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,450
reducing the likelihood of things like

1170
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:35,940
breaches of you know ransomware attacks

1171
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:42,390
and so on and that's that's me so just

1172
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:46,050
quickly and qr-code central I co run

1173
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,910
cybersquatting Connect which is a

1174
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,510
community based organization in Scotland

1175
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:54,630
Edinburgh because where I live i co run

1176
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:57,630
this with Stu Hirst of many of much fame

1177
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,390
so you may or may not have heard of him

1178
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:03,390
we run meetups so we run two meetups in

1179
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:05,370
Edinburgh one is like the big one and

1180
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:08,070
it's that 140 people usually with some

1181
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,800
great presenters great speakers and we

1182
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,140
also run the little one which is open

1183
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,410
mics with no singing because we can't

1184
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,480
sing but the open mics are essentially

1185
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,580
you don't have to you don't do not have

1186
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,400
to prepare a talk you don't have to get

1187
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,320
permission to give your talk with some

1188
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,010
light boundaries obviously in the good

1189
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:32,040
taste and so on but you can just stand

1190
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,530
up and talk and so you know we run that

1191
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,440
every other month at Napier and yeah

1192
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,520
it's been really successful so far

1193
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,140
people literally just to rock up and go

1194
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,180
right sorry work in a sock but I'm gonna

1195
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,860
talk about physical security got no

1196
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,090
background in it but

1197
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:47,820
I thought was really interesting oh that

1198
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:48,870
was really cool

1199
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,640
another guy's throw up said I'm a threat

1200
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,260
model letters anyone know that is no

1201
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,940
cool anyway for 20 minutes talking about

1202
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,770
threat modeling it's a fantastic you

1203
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,420
know and so the idea is just trying to

1204
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,980
encourage people that are perhaps and

1205
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,110
less experienced or less confident

1206
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,030
it's very non-judgmental so please do

1207
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,590
come along if you find us on Twitter

1208
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,020
Linkedin we've got a slack it's the same

1209
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,480
slack as this events using and we've

1210
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,010
started collecting resources that we

1211
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,750
think a useful for the community and

1212
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,160
what's really interesting is in the few

1213
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,290
commits to that we've had so far the

1214
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:18,000
vast majority have been nothing to do a

1215
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,730
technology and everything to do with

1216
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:23,850
inclusivity equality well-being mental

1217
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:25,650
health it's really interesting just to

1218
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:27,540
see like the spread already is people

1219
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,830
going how can you support each other

1220
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:29,160
better

1221
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,860
be kinder to each other etc ie don't be

1222
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,270
dicks as everyone else has said so far

1223
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:38,340
and so so yeah that's it and any

1224
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,880
questions

1225
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,170
[Applause]

1226
00:47:46,040 --> 00:48:09,750
hello mmm-hmm sure so so within kind of

1227
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,840
the same space and you know sorry yeah

1228
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,000
so the question was you know the use of

1229
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,780
things like machine learning for anomaly

1230
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,640
detection behavioral insights that kind

1231
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,090
of thing and so I've used that

1232
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:25,950
personally in two tool sets so that the

1233
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:27,510
first which is an extension to the

1234
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:30,660
seemed really and that is so with the

1235
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,010
tool that we use flunk you can you store

1236
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,510
think all the machine learning toolkit

1237
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,770
and that's essentially all the

1238
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:36,960
open-source Python libraries that you

1239
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,160
can do a ton of machine learning with

1240
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,890
and it can be really useful at giving

1241
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,470
you indicators now I've not seen much

1242
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:46,470
success in it having like 100% like I

1243
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:49,380
think like the marketing is very bias

1244
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:53,280
when it comes to AI /ml and it's you

1245
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,320
know always like you know go from a

1246
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,970
billion events to a hundred thousand

1247
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,730
alerts to just finding that one

1248
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,890
and it's coming yes sometimes and

1249
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:03,890
sometimes you go that guy's not worked

1250
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:08,270
for a year you know shut up and and you

1251
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:11,960
know so I think it's not it's not all

1252
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,340
it's cracked up to be but it's another

1253
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,130
tool it's another way of looking at data

1254
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:19,940
in perhaps a less deterministic fashion

1255
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,160
and to look for things like so the most

1256
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,230
most effective ways I've seen it used is

1257
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:27,109
basics being around peer grouping so

1258
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:30,200
that's when you say so you five are all

1259
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,080
at admins and your behavior is this and

1260
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,210
you you spend this long online per day

1261
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,340
you login this many times your average

1262
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,780
failure rate for you're logging into

1263
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,880
your password is this and you will you

1264
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,740
log into these servers roughly once a

1265
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:46,960
week cool this person is a developer and

1266
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,369
through and part of their development

1267
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:51,680
group they on average only log into

1268
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,930
their own box and their jump box for

1269
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:56,330
deployments and suddenly that guy's

1270
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,310
logging into a hundred servers within

1271
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:00,530
the last five minutes that's weird

1272
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,480
but is they're not they're not

1273
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,250
brute-forcing they're all official dual

1274
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,740
good logins so you know all your

1275
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,180
detective controls are your normal

1276
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,890
alerts wouldn't pick that up because

1277
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:12,710
that's that's legit but machine learning

1278
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,930
might if you if you do things like peer

1279
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:16,970
grouping and behavioral analytics might

1280
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:19,760
go but wait a minute his peer the people

1281
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,230
he communicates with that he's in the

1282
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:22,820
same group off same line manager

1283
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,740
possibly they never do anything like

1284
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,840
that that's the kind of activity that

1285
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,730
someone like that might do that's odd

1286
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,580
now it's not proven malicious maybe he

1287
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,430
changed job role could be bought or

1288
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:36,050
maybe you know someone's hijacked their

1289
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:38,270
account you know crack the local admin

1290
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:40,130
password that the admins use and is now

1291
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:42,800
all over your network so that that's

1292
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,990
what I've seen that you're genuinely

1293
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,850
finding threats or indicating that there

1294
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:52,820
are threats yeah any more questions any

1295
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,890
questions outside of the topic don't

1296
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:57,040
mind answering anything else is fine

1297
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,380
awesome okay guys thanks a lot

1298
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:00,550
you

1299
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:04,530
[Applause]
