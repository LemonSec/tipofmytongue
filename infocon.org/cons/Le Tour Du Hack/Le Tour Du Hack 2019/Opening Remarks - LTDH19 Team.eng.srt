1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,630
oh hello everybody and welcome to the

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:14,029
highway 19 it's very evident that a lot

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,589
of people like to set the back but it's

4
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:18,200
very evident that people then like happy

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,380
at registration and the facts for coming

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,079
no I don't prepare laughs I was out till

7
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:26,720
one o'clock this one so and I've just

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,669
got my grandma Lee open here so he still

9
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:33,350
gets it correct so that's just stood

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,280
exit george watsons college yes a venue

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,590
same the first litter the hike not ran

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,270
at an EP or however fun fact all the had

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,940
to be on the same street and just a

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,190
coincidence and therefore many of this

15
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,390
will be the first time we're back in our

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,760
school quite a while so you maybe get

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,190
like PTSD flashbacks I'll be in at

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,690
school don't worry

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,579
hopefully no billion here him however

20
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:03,560
who gets up and this is a father to the

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,110
hug 17 they started 70 and dividuals

22
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,450
competing our CTF over a weekend in the

23
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,979
classroom he probably passed I became

24
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:15,470
incontinent then last year we had a

25
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,930
hundred and fifty attendees coming to do

26
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,360
a workshop then our CTF and then this

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,750
year we've get this which we saw a bit

28
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,900
230 packets and so therefore I go and

29
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,159
bear are growing every year so moving

30
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,840
that confidence say we try to do

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,010
something completely different like

32
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,970
which I do change it to cater to what we

33
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,799
wanted to do until the educational ethos

34
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,330
we wanted to make sure people down and

35
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,070
took something away from the weekend and

36
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,690
I think we can do that with the staple

37
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:50,150
of em like the venue in the or donor

38
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,640
agenda and special with the two tracks

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,810
and couldn't one day to get to the

40
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,810

41
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,930

43
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,219

start at the bottom roller for stock of

47
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,420
illegal jacks get cracking enter beneath

48
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,730

the box and lloyd's some of them are in

51
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,150

will speak to them they've got swag they

53
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,040
bit stackers and they have most

54
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,840

59
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,000

62
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,310
sorry but up and so when your age did

63
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,440
you get your swag bike and among it you

64
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,240
got an array of stackers but also if you

65
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,740
inferred your t-shirt you got that split

66
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,350
clip this Pickler has everything so as

67
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,880
they run order for the day so you know

68
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,280
what talks to go to and it's also got

69
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,240
the just got the Wi-Fi passwords at the

70
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,070
back along with social links and QR

71
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,620
codes to both I worked what are which

72
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,670
were doing updates throughout the day

73
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,420
and also cyber Scotland connects and

74
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,000
slack which one Gavin updates for a day

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
so going back to the speaking there is

76
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,460
hawks royalty from people set in the

77
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,180
front row

78
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,500
people going here yet but and the only

79
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,820
thing I have to see is the talks have

80
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,130
been recorded and they will be good on I

81
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,380
managed to have that video from Cooper's

82
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,120
worries and kipper stuffs that's we've

83
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,130
seen many Cooper on the camera right

84
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,650
here and then we will the owner hang

85
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,120
guys was only one talk that's not yet

86
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,190
recorded and that's dunks Carson spoon

87
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,970
freakin top so therefore he he can't you

88
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,350
want to see that you can't mess it here

89
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,760
because it's going to be not recorded

90
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:05,110
pelea and so just to move on finally and

91
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,640
go on to the code of conduct

92
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,100
so as of any English take event the call

93
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,480
to conduct as a barrel and code of

94
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,690
conduct and this and the booklet as well

95
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,660
but it basically boils down to don't be

96
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,959
at that and not to be taking jest all we

97
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,660
do take any code of conduct violations

98
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,820
seriously and if you have our critical

99
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,100
violation you need

100
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,080
one speaks someone in the black branded

101
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,120
t-shirts with the kamati badges that

102
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,920
says em the people who are responsible

103
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,420
for getting all sorted we will take

104
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,480
things very seriously and our goal left

105
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,010
that system in teen was super hard to be

106
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,250
an educational event less and

107
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,600
accommodate an environment to foster a

108
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,760
learning experience and that's what this

109
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,890
event is all about talking about

110
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,470
learning experiences passed over and Max

111
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,390

112

115
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,170
exits here so like all throughout the

116
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,790
day the fire X is really clearly marked

117
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,490
if you're in this building or track 2

118
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,470
which is kind of upstairs then an

119
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,260
assembly point is out the front so when

120
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,870
we go over to track 1 which is out the

121
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,880
back here then I will tell you at the

122
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,200
beginning of the day like where where

123

toilets if you need them out the front

125
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,740
and sort of to the right there very

126
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,570
clearly marked with with big posters one

127
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,550

128
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,710
like with a woman and and one with a man

129
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,270
and wear your lanyard all the time

130
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,950
please if like we've been told that if

131
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,870
if you're seen without a lanyard then

132
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,250
people will kick you off the site

133
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,230
because you might just be like an

134
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,250
interloper or something yeah yeah

135
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,860
so photos and stuff were fine but if you

136
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,540
see somebody wearing wearing a blue

137
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,490
lanyard please try to avoid taking

138
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,980
taking a photograph of them not because

139
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,630
they're spies or anything like that but

140
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,220
just because they'd rather not be

141
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,360
photographed and phones on silent

142
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,250
obviously um what was the other one

143
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,200

144
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,630
