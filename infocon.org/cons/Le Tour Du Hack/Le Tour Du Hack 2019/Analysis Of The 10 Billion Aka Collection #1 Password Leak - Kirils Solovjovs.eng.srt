1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,389
imagine called winter warning in Russia

2
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,860
Taiwan is just working in his office his

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,189
businessman who sailed enough source he

4
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:22,980
is a reseller in that device products

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,769
and he sells them actually he sells in

6
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:33,129
touch property stuff he can copy

7
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:34,809
something to copy legally stuff he can

8
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:37,840
steal and duplicated and he notices that

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,260
Vlad has turned from his customer into

10
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,430
his competitor Vlad has copied his

11
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,980
product and is now selling it for half

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,190
the price so that's how the story starts

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,370
we can talk about collection one leaks

14
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,070
they've also been called 10 billion

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,379
leaks because apparently there are 10

16
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,119
doing records most poor little herb

17
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,290
there are not but in any case let's

18
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,590
start by taking a look at how passwords

19
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,390
to get please from how I seen you the

20
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,770
audience interacting to the previous

21
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,090
speakers I see that you were actually

22
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,770
quite that wealth will burst or the

23
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,950
insane IP so maybe you know this level

24
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,829
running gonna be don't so there's a you

25
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:36,640
were right and maybe you even get

26
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,930
probably maybe your mom or your dad

27
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,150
right some some people for no servile

28
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,520
work Nike and there are websites and

29
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,170
users tend to register those F times

30
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,610
where they create accounts they create

31
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,009
profiles so they set up a password right

32
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,630
maybe it's wonder if that maybe it's a

33
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:54,250
couple website we also have hackers who

34
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,619
tend to crack these websites and this is

35
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:59,469
the most likely scenario of how users

36
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:01,390
passwords get stolen and Massa

37
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,689
to look at the average passwords being

38
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:06,659
stolen so it's actually not true that

39
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,758
hackers hack your smart devices as they

40
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,740
pack your

41
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,380
you turn that is how they strap the

42
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,550
Bolton separate the ball through the

43
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,740
best works actually come from website

44
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,030
being test and get back to what some

45
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,040
users then to reuse their passwords

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,830
right this look talking joke here on on

47
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,590
your left keep iterating through website

48
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,750
with the same passwords Packer can only

49
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,220
attack one of those upside where these

50
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,800
are registered and now they have the

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,870
password and the email address which is

52
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,740
Bennett for use these days mostly poor

53
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,260
both the sites just protecting the ones

54
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,870
rights what happens nice right so tech

55
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,670
are some either skilled individuals or

56
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,260
just some very lucky individuals who

57
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,290
tend to be in the right place at the

58
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,290
right time and tag the right system

59
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,210
sometimes it does take skill sometimes

60
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,750
it's your luck and having things just

61
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,430
leaked we're ordering that you can use

62
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,140
whatever things what the detectors do

63
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,080
was a bit bigger than that well unless

64
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,270
it's an apt campaign aware or

65
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,240
governmental run campaigns these hackers

66
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,360
don't usually hold on that for long they

67
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,570
don't have what abuse or that actually

68
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,420
the criminal world criminal world in

69
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,990
computing is quite well structures it is

70
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,030
an enterprise that there's a system

71
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,570
better friends as I tried to illustrate

72
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,940
my main story in the beginning and what

73
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,420
happens is these hackers sell the data

74
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,900
to data brokers or data hoarders there

75
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,350
are two types of those and money begins

76
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,710
to be involved and this at the stage and

77
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,780
then it's of course in the open

78
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,540
direction of the line right so what was

79
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,880
that brokers did they research right we

80
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,520
have the dark web so basically I'm not

81
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,320
talking about these great boys that are

82
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,160
available quite easily to

83
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,900
crackers and researchers alike but what

84
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,190
I'm talking about the dark web or only

85
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,370
trusted trusted individuals interoperate

86
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,130
not to say that there are some real

87
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,650
everything in there and on the dark web

88
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,240
set the sail cabins right we have

89
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,490
multiple buyers they just changed fake a

90
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,419
proxy of the price that the reseller

91
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:34,000
paid but they have many clients so they

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,560
make more money right so that's all

93
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,560
well sometimes becomes that some of the

94
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,960
buyers aren't that honest right they're

95
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,300
criminals after all most of them are so

96
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,780
they go back with mortgage was a cheaper

97
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,409
price on that and sometimes it happens

98
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:56,199
that some of them for some reason decide

99
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,380
just open it up and go to normal

100
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,569
internet go to you know the traditional

101
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,330
events maybe maybe not not so really

102
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,560
what collection moments all right that

103
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,090
everyone can download the collection one

104
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,520
with the passwords right now I'm not

105
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,080
sure about the reality of that indicate

106
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,130
but everyone everyone can do that easily

107
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,590
mostly it's not it's not open it's in

108
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,389
those semi closed forms but you can

109
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,069
still you can still get them when they

110
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:23,909
get published so that basically be the

111
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:27,070
timeline of how password leaks happen

112
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,050
from user selecting the password -

113
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,099
password getting late now I want to talk

114
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,130
about the specific case and what

115
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,659
happened in the specific case right here

116
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:44,560
is question one so this year is a

117
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,310
profile of an individual named corpse on

118
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,180
one of these not dark mint worms as you

119
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,759
can see the profile has been banned

120
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,789
already at this point he does himself

121
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:00,610
ethical hacker encoder that's a guy who

122
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,400
was the hoarder for for collection one

123
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,389
that's another collector that's original

124
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:09,849
original attacker who collected these

125
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:12,430
actions he probably didn't hack any of

126
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,919
them or at least most of them but he was

127
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:18,430
the original collector right and you can

128
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,330
actually see a prima right here that Sam

129
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,370
he was banned on the 30th of January and

130
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,349
he only registered on the 6th of January

131
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:30,870
also 2019 by the way so what happened

132
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,389
this is what happened

133
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:36,120
he basically created the post of his own

134
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,120
stuff on this semi semi closed form say

135
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,599
here are my collections check them out

136
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:47,419
you can you can get them from here right

137
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:51,360
let me know if I have this this is my

138
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,280
different guy who goes by the title of

139
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,830
zomick's there was a similar offering by

140
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,139
a guy named the Clorox but samox was was

141
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,139
this more more recognized one you can

142
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:02,490
see the guy on first you can't really

143
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,940
see them the price here is $45 for

144
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,080
lifetime access with free updates for

145
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,750
different combinations of usernames and

146
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,550
passwords it even says here that the

147
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,699
type is email : password which is

148
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,220
totally not true I spent many many hours

149
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,610
trying to format most of these files to

150
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,130
this alleged format back this format and

151
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,259
I still didn't succeed fully but I got

152
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,110
like 95% of the dates reformatted

153
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,599
correctly so that's just a nice

154
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,389
advertisement we see some sizes here 19

155
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,520
gigabytes for collection 1/2 terabytes

156
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,270
for collection 2 and so on right

157
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:48,389
so sanics is the guy who saw from this

158
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:54,690
other criminal course the collections so

159
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,940
he bought the collections and he he was

160
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,550
reselling them the original creator was

161
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,830
one that was in weekly updates and of

162
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,719
course that was cut off so the original

163
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:06,900
traitor noticed that promptly we are

164
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,669
talking let me give you a timeline here

165
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:14,190
so collection once started existing

166
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,530
allegedly as the second half of 2017 and

167
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:24,900
now we're in January 2019 where Corpse

168
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,440
notices this happening and what he

169
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,810
does is simple he just posts the

170
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,849
collections of the semi semi closed form

171
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,159
saying you know others guys has been

172
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,190
stealing my stuff so in making money of

173
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,909
me here we go here's my stuff for free

174
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,470
that's that's where you can have

175
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,470
and it was done mid mid January right

176
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,350
so the latest data that we have in

177
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,240
collection 1 and number collections here

178
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,570
is actually beginning this year which is

179
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,370
which is quite cool for researcher we

180
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,960
can look at some trends there to look at

181
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:03,120
how passwords change right what's what's

182
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,230
the most common password doesn't

183
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,970
maintain no no password that was 2012

184
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:14,310
which one did you prefer things yeah a

185
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,800
fat sort of stuff doesn't so it is one

186
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,960
of those people part 6 in 2013 so we'll

187
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,910
see what we have in beginning person

188
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,250
line 19 at the beginning of the survey

189
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,340
at the end of the transition here so and

190
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,620
then we have other guys reposting stuff

191
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,090
so this guy here actually put everything

192
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,550
in one in one large file all collections

193
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:39,630
where you download them so of course I

194
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,580
decided to do some research and others

195
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,890
are everything to tell you and I took a

196
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,150
look at what we have there so download

197
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,870
it all all girlfriends right around

198
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,960
around terabyte of compressed data

199
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,020
before even so this is this will be

200
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,620
cabin side right so we have a lot of

201
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,150
text files but you also have some more

202
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,130
archives which means there may be even

203
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,530
more text files inside right for for

204
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,610
ASCII text we may we may see up to up to

205
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,040
around 50 percent compression ratio

206
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,590
right so fun but one thing is that you

207
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,120
should keep in mind through the

208
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,460
presentation and in the future and other

209
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,800
people or media and talk about these

210
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,930
leaks that happens beginning of the 19th

211
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,950
is this much of the stuff in there is

212
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,200
good wickets right so the red part here

213
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,410
in this graph are files that already are

214
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,140
the great work that's done by file town

215
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,300
so we have 24%

216
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,240
bootlickers file just downloading all

217
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,760
that from me

218
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,279
okay let's extract them right let's take

219
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,779
a look what happens when we extract and

220
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,670
only the one level stretch extraction

221
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,949
because after doing that I mean even

222
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:54,570
though we still have some compressed

223
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,510
files it's not a lot for both of them so

224
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,240
we kind of mostly text almost 95% text

225
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,040
and we have become some other formats as

226
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:08,399
well here the situation is even worse we

227
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,649
have around 30 percent or 1/3 duplicate

228
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:14,550
files so again the database is not clean

229
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,500
at all as I said already it's not

230
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,730
actually it is mostly in user user :

231
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,790
platter format but not fully and it's a

232
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,089
lot of the book consensus so beside wise

233
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:29,339
let's take a look how are they to be

234
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,649
careful so we have collection one which

235
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,339
is compressed to 37 gigabytes as a

236
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,220
dangerous abuse we have a collection 2

237
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,800
to 5 and so-called on the public

238
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,250
database which is critical partly then

239
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,089
we have 12 billion special file which

240
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,940
actually contains 12 billion records and

241
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,639
it's a 90 gigabytes compress then it's

242
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,889
quite like a clean one and just one

243
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:01,110
large file then we have leak called Big

244
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,630
D be around 600 degrees

245
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,389
so all these leaks so they happen the

246
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:08,100
beginning of this year right we start

247
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,800
this collection one and immediately I

248
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,779
think that was next day over there so

249
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,220
that that they notice that we have all

250
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,040
these other bit source available so

251
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,740
total that's around one terabyte of data

252
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,040
but when we do the extractions as the

253
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,569
first of extraction what we get is

254
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:27,720
additional per byte of data so we're

255
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,470
looking here at two terabytes of

256
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,100
usernames passwords some credit card

257
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,260
numbers some names surnames just a bit

258
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,779
of addresses recovery question which is

259
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,639
which is quite a cool stuff to research

260
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,230
actually I've never I've never

261
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,000
researched password recovery questions

262
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,760
before it actually makes you think of

263
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,680
people think so how do you process

264
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,460
such large amount of data many scholars

265
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,580
today look at different different

266
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,280
different cool big data tools that that

267
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,570
do near basic spins right what the right

268
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,120
solution as a person who uses open

269
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,810
source a lot

270
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,170
the resolution is of course new portals

271
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,290
and the thing working which don't do

272
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,600
nearly speed the new disk speed that's

273
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,030
what I do processing text files is super

274
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,970
easy as a possibility right so the tools

275
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,310
I use for his research is find of course

276
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,620
because the structure of that all the

277
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,240
files was so complicated just wrote a

278
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,580
small script where I specified some part

279
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,220
of the powerful finds it for me cat

280
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,530
breath we see anyone anyone use direct

281
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:44,520
here regret them nice nice said of

282
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,710
course and the problem anyone use

283
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:51,990
promised no one okay okay I knew that so

284
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,180
that's good that your how to use Linux

285
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,910
or our Linux user so you know grep right

286
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,380
progress is a straight relatively new

287
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:04,470
tool in in full set and this is what it

288
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:10,220
does so when you launch it it looks for

289
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,390
processes that have problems tippers

290
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,270
open look at the files and gives you

291
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,370
progress of reading the writing those

292
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,370
files which means you don't have to wait

293
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,690
without knowing how long you have to

294
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,760
wait it's really cool you kind of like

295
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,350
your sup running getting another thermal

296
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,780
you run progress and you see you through

297
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,089
this so that's that's quite a cool tool

298
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:32,160
when you when you you know when to the

299
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,850
time okay but what what I'm looking at

300
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,760
here today for this presentation is just

301
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,070
collection one just this 90 gigabytes

302
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,520
uncompressed data not the tube turbine

303
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,530
because processing that so still is

304
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,310
still ongoing

305
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:54,020
it's the server is still working there

306
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,100
in collection one in the media we can

307
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,450
see different numbers these are numbers

308
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,610
of thy God and they will fluctuate by at

309
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,779
many more depending on how clean that is

310
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:13,700
or how clean you make the vagueness

311
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,600
right so what I got is 2.8 billion

312
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,630
records inside all the files is what you

313
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,019
want to the point eight separate records

314
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:28,990
of mostly users and they're backwards

315
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,360
speaking of users what I got is around

316
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,050
900 million the current unique of

317
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,329
usernames the previous number was total

318
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:44,930
records including non unique slipping by

319
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,880
usernames what I have is around nine

320
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,980
million nine hundred million usernames

321
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,070
and around 20 million different sensors

322
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,880
[Music]

323
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,910
now the fun part let's actual analyze

324
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,720
that let's start with the user names

325
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
which are mostly of course these days

326
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,700
email addresses not hundred percent and

327
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,160
even in collection one we see user names

328
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,019
of their actual user names but luckily

329
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:13,699
for us and there's also a field for

330
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:16,190
email addresses on databases Lee Hulu

331
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,630
and analyzing email addresses by TLD

332
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:25,820
this is the picture that we get and I

333
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,910
did that in order to understand what is

334
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,579
the source of the leads who collected it

335
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:35,480
and why what we can see is that of

336
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,519
course most records are collected for

337
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,760
calm which is obvious calm is the most

338
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,339
popular domain the first the first TLD

339
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:45,589
that we've had and the second place is

340
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:48,560
Russians right so apparently thrush

341
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,990
attacker second versions so that's the

342
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,140
conclusion that I came to right on the

343
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,220
third class we have two TLDs which are

344
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,899
those dotnet and the qk which is

345
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:04,309
interesting i mean i didn't i didn't

346
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:06,230
expect that i can't kind of finish this

347
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,299
picture when when apply this compressed

348
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:11,630
so that's not why I came but we do see

349
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,109
we do see quite a lot we also see the

350
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,510
opposite France

351
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,829
the Germany in the top so basically it

352
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,419
looks like they're mostly considered a

353
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:24,939
Europe but not not just Europe

354
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:28,630
okay let's split it a bit more rock

355
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,880
let's split by the maze thank you but

356
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,650
the mains we see the popular email

357
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,690
providers Yahoo Gmail Hotmail then we

358
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,429
see mail rule we just need to get there

359
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:38,530
first of all Russia being one of the

360
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:44,799
main stars here for different patients

361
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,200
here in UK I also did supplies just

362
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,580
looking to pay they had so poor UK email

363
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,350
addresses this is what we see we see

364
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,500
caught mail the aku life fiscally blue

365
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,210
yonder and Gmail and some others right

366
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,679
so that's where you came now one

367
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,160
interesting thing to look at in the

368
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,760
fleet and in analyzing throg data is

369
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,419
always super mental data and of course I

370
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:19,980
did a split by your metal addresses and

371
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,429
I wanted to see what governmental email

372
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:26,980
for governmental domains are we seeing

373
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,610
and these are the most of the mains that

374
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,830
belong to to the government right you

375
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,460
see some Australian ones though the

376
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,020
first two are educational ones which

377
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,260
means those are probably just on the

378
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,419
government that have decided not to use

379
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:45,820
dot edu and instead you go for vacation

380
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,590
arenas which means that students and

381
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,480
pupils get those domains which is you

382
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,910
know and then they end up like that

383
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,120
which is under central but we do see

384
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,340
some interesting one so lessons of God I

385
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,299
think we've already mentioned in the

386
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:01,120
press in reverses this week we can be HS

387
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,760
of course for

388
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,280
afford for for the US and one not making

389
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,650
comment here top eleven is is actually

390
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,320
our arrest base norm in terms of the

391
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,100
insist America now assuming a bit back

392
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:21,790
out which governments are the least

393
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,030
unsafe in this regards which government

394
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,710
do not trained cyber hygiene problems

395
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,630
with airplanes and allow work

396
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,120
not punish people from using their

397
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,770
governmental email others urge to turn

398
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,690
them sites well here we are

399
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,060
the first one is years of course they

400
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,070
get dug up because they are the ones

401
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,650
gonna have interest kinda let me kept UK

402
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,200
then we kept you know Austria Brazil and

403
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,410
and so on again slide specifically for

404
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:55,220
UK just looking at WK domains so the

405
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,930
coal 360° is all the governors UK in its

406
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,540
collection relief you probably know

407
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,790
better than I what these are but we have

408
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:09,140
Kent DW PSX Cornwall and and so on and

409
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,930
we can the distribution here is is is

410
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,230
quite quite normalize they actually see

411
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,570
that a lot of them are the same weight

412
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,920
that we don't see if your top 10 so top

413
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,610
UK passwords which is the so keeping

414
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,500
that the collection only happened

415
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,740
allegedly somewhere around 2017

416
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,970
you know the collecting of the

417
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,850
collection which is a tough password for

418
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:43,760
for DK what I think yeah good password

419
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,500
because it's not pass for this password

420
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,260
but it was a large the depth of other

421
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,990
piece so it's safer than just using the

422
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,480
classical fasteners in just a bit just a

423
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,040
bit and 1/4 of a percent is the

424
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,460
prevalence of this password in the UK

425
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:01,940
campus

426
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,100
right password used by account holders

427
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,340
within 11 document we also have a budget

428
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,560
on the proposal for the the classical 1

429
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,500
1 2 3 4 5 6 and we kept Liverpool yeah

430
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,600
I'm it's a city right where we're work

431
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,250
it's just the phone ah football team

432
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,450
right right right

433
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,010
so that's why I can't believe our school

434
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:23,240
and best position charlie also also not

435
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,390
seen in

436
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,620
in the global confusion no recovery

437
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,600
questions is interesting part as I

438
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,049
already mentioned so what do people

439
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:35,610
actually type in the recovery questions

440
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,500
I remember when they create my accounts

441
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,920
they back when I beat credit account cuz

442
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,809
I can't make my house work for a year

443
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:48,090
they they offered you a fixed-width of

444
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,559
pushes you couldn't pack your own and

445
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,000
those questions are so dumb but I never

446
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,590
knew what to what the answers they're

447
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,820
always like mom don't have my coat

448
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,799
but these days many sites allow you

449
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,809
which is do business on your own

450
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:05,940
question so an extract of some Russian

451
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,580
guy or girl registering their accounts

452
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,950
and selecting their quarry questions and

453
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,400
answers the first recovery questions who

454
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,150
are you

455
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,429
that's what they type right that's a

456
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:19,020
recovery question and the answer I

457
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:25,470
selected is it's me then we have no it's

458
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,480
a guy thing

459
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,320
then the admin is like reporters yes we

460
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,770
also have Who am I and obviously the

461
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:40,049
answer is panel I also know things and a

462
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:42,900
bunch of these actually it's a fact it's

463
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,510
a lot security tech because a this is

464
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,250
one part why I pulled this from a

465
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,770
specific specific platform down oh it

466
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,210
wasn't good water there's passwords as

467
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,030
you as you imagine so it's far too low

468
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,350
security said because it allowed you to

469
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,299
do this and most using do that

470
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,280
that just packing the same thing for the

471
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:07,140
question and the answer so now coming to

472
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,840
the conclusion of the short talk of

473
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,190
course we have to talk about what to do

474
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,410
in the future to to avoid these things

475
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:20,610
and leaks are going to happen sites are

476
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,780
not perfect zero this happened just just

477
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,460
this year we already had a bunch of zero

478
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,080
days Ponto on just just finished we

479
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,080
we've seen zero days in

480
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,140
zero days in cars it's gonna is gonna be

481
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,870
happening so what we can do is users is

482
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,510
the first point of course do not free

483
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,850
with your password don't reuse similar

484
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,380
passwords as ones if you use somewhere

485
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,020
else right do not reuse the passwords

486
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,310
that you use in 2017 obviously choose

487
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:56,840
strong passwords and at least you'll a

488
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,900
PA which is where I come from our

489
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,790
government cert is not doing a very good

490
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,450
job of teaching people what password is

491
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,970
so what they do they they just tell you

492
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,650
should we do take some words so you take

493
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,180
picture your world you change the

494
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,070
selectors to some single disorder which

495
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,010
is of course a dumb ideas the other

496
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,170
extreme that I've seen people teaching

497
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,970
to other people is that you should just

498
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,830
make sure a board and that's that your

499
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,970
password for me after we had had a

500
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,730
router companies that make drops from

501
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:33,230
Latvia that did that were there P they

502
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,580
caught what it either they use for

503
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,800
encrypting stuff some guy just matches

504
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,470
password i reversed of their firmware

505
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,810
got out that of that map is on keyboard

506
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,330
you can see two hands going down on the

507
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,520
keyboard when you do keep that off of

508
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,410
that string and that's how they pick all

509
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,970
the passwords anyway

510
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,950
that's also bad idea but not just

511
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,600
because of matching because it's hard to

512
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,670
remember and if it's short it's

513
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,250
relatively easy to crack us best route

514
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,310
password is a pass phrase meaning it's a

515
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,710
sentence it's long and it easy to

516
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,500
remember that's the pro password but of

517
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,520
course these days we have back

518
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,370
adventures if you are kind of person

519
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,850
that implies trust became a bit more

520
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,870
than me

521
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,420
a pattern managers are great to you

522
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,970
generate long random string of

523
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,520
characters and and it works and it's

524
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,380
done it's super secure but I think I'm

525
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,270
wrong but among as we have magic users

526
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,640
we also have developers or potential

527
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,500
developers so I'll talk to you I want to

528
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,410
talk about I think that some of you I'm

529
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,870
sure are well it's not you maybe you're

530
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,290
not and that this daunting of course

531
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:48,440
we're creating a system you have to salt

532
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,650
your password and this is what it means

533
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,990
right in the database you pass your

534
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,290
password right that's generally adopts a

535
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,790
one-way function so you can't get back

536
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,380
the original one but when he interacted

537
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,090
passwords they can sit and can check it

538
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,550
in the restaurant or not if different

539
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,290
users would use the same password the

540
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,510
salt the catch will be the same as you

541
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,120
see on the left instead for each user

542
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,800
and I professionally I sometimes quite

543
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,960
often do security orders including white

544
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,930
box audience and I've seen a bunch of

545
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,880
systems who are sole is hard-coded to

546
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,680
the system so don't do that

547
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,450
every time a user to the password

548
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,790
creating new random salt as seen in the

549
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,030
blue part here on your right and then

550
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,010
use that the conscious password and the

551
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,360
cache will be different which means it

552
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,790
will be harder for an attacker to become

553
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:42,790
a victim ass-crack your user passwords

554
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:49,280
so in conclusion I want to emphasize

555
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,990
once again what's been done and baked in

556
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,960
the media but I think that's enough the

557
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,300
leaks that happened beginning of the

558
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,950
year including collection one than the

559
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:05,320
other leaks most of them are old we see

560
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,910
and I see updates after January 2019 but

561
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,360
analyzing them I'm not so sure that they

562
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,060
are too real I mean that the date

563
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,340
matches what that days maybe that's just

564
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,410
some criminal doing business criminal

565
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,420
style and you know generating random

566
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,940
password user list and send the others

567
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,820
out there that's that entire thing but

568
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,570
mostly most the bulk of that is quite

569
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,330
old I'm not talking super old of my face

570
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,640
signs but it's it's couple years old so

571
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,740
if you do proper cyber hygiene and you

572
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,310
change your password prepared time you

573
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:53,840
should be okay so finally I did I did

574
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,160
that last collection one presentation

575
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,770
but they also have started

576
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,510
analyze that call two terabytes of data

577
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:04,330
and I looked at passwords from January

578
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:09,950
2019 and the top passwords from January

579
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,870
2019 is one two three four five six so

580
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,190
we're back there which is kind of kind

581
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:24,280
of the reporting but yes that is from

582
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,830
the around ten million passwords that

583
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:32,350
were marked as update of January 2019

584
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:37,180
0.32% were using this as a very happy

585
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,570
that's me

586
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,130
is there any questions I'm happy to

587
00:28:40,130 --> 00:29:00,260
answer yes well that depends your

588
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,010
processing power

589
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:04,610
um this is that is not my research is

590
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,790
not a paid gig so I don't I'm not

591
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,230
interested in spending $20 per hour for

592
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:15,320
another GPU servers so for me I'm

593
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,970
looking good I'm looking at you know I

594
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,370
think probably end of March beginning of

595
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,370
April when what everything done so with

596
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:28,280
my resources it's it's less than that

597
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,780
less than a month but once again it's

598
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,300
like it not only depends on the money

599
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,760
when it must also depends on the kind of

600
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,290
research on do if you just don't know

601
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,900
the top password with my resources I

602
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,970
think you can do that so in in one day

603
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,670
easily well maybe two dates on the two

604
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,380
terabytes of data

605
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:52,700
yeah but do use no do use open source

606
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,650
tools as three tools of their super

607
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,990
cross that I mean those are disk speed

608
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,500
doesn't matter if it's a GB were for SSD

609
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,300
it tries to be fast

610
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,410
okay thank you very much for having me

611
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,010
you

612
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,609
[Applause]
