1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,859
so welcome to my talk thank you all for

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,319
coming and choosing me over whatever is

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,809
on the other track so the title of my

4
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,119
talk is a quick look at mark o/s

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:16,500
thumbnails so this is basically a very

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,190
high-level overview of centralized

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,760
thumbnail caches and mccoys so first of

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,060
all let's say a couple of words about

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,450
who I am so I'm a fourth-year student of

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,750
cyber security and forensics at Napier

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,020
and research that I'm showing today is

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,230
actually my dissertation project so it's

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,680
due in a week I'm very happy to be here

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,079
it may be a couple of words of how I got

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,420
here so a couple of years ago I attended

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,700
a jungle girls event

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,430
I made the blog I was very excited about

18
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,280
making something that works and then I

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,530
started mentoring at other jungle girl's

20
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,899
events I started organizing some other

21
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,120
jungle girls events I got involved in

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,188
the Python community then for some

23
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,649
reason I don't remember why I applied

24
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:10,950
for I didn't run a pair to study

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,200
cybersecurity and I quickly joined in

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,020
your psyche where I started just going

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,649
to all the meetups that are you know

28
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:21,479
around Scotland all the conferences and

29
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,880
then last summer I interned at lone

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,069
hooks and now I'm here and I will help

31
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:30,029
people hopefully graduate soon in May I

32
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:32,159
think let's let's keep our fingers

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,240
crossed for that okay so what our family

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,289
is probably most of you know homeless

35
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:43,200
are just the miniature little images of

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,619
fight that represent the files made by

37
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,869
your operating systems they are there to

38
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,749
help you navigate your files because if

39
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:54,959
you were just supposed to remember what

40
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,880
your files are but just by the family as

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,439
we all know that we just call everything

42
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,020
f DF DF D so like you need fabulous

43
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,529
right so what's interesting from those

44
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:07,399
and as far as I'm concerned most

45
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:10,830
mainstream operating systems right now

46
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,380
they are not only made for for image

47
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,130
files as you

48
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,380
 but for many other files like

49
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,080
called text-editor files PDFs images

50
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,900
videos obviously and a lot a lot of

51
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,620
different ones so in Mac OS specifically

52
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,650
the technology that the mechanism of

53
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,630
making these thumbnails is called quick

54
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,600
look and it's also responsible for that

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,690
cool feature that you can just select a

56
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,580
file and then press the space stop and

57
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,100
then you can get a full preview of for

58
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,500
example if it's a PDF of a couple of

59
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,940
pages you can scroll through these pages

60
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,800
you can read it it's completely fine but

61
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
it's not actually opening the file it's

62
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,470
just a quick look at the file so just

63
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,980
before we continue this talk is only

64
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,740
about Mac OS so if you are interested in

65
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,350
Windows and Linux for comparison or just

66
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,590
to just to learn something new you can

67
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,750
scan this QR code if you have an iPhone

68
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,990
just open your camera and and pointed at

69
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,550
this and it should take you to a link

70
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,090
where I put up some resources and so if

71
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,890
you are interested in with the cinetic

72
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,350
go do that but today I'm only talking

73
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,970
about Mac OS so what are hotmail caches

74
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,030
they are basically directories and you

75
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,070
will have a separate directory for each

76
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,920
user so that's important because it

77
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,220
turns out that the when you're root when

78
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,440
you're admin you can access all the

79
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,080
other standard accounts caches from your

80
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,330
account so that will be useful later

81
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,620
which I'll get to that anyway how where

82
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,290
where is this cache so you go to bar

83
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,260
folders then you go there there will be

84
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,600
a random two letter string a a from

85
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,650
directory name then there will be a

86
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,870
random long string and then there will

87
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,750
be a C directory and come up

88
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:23,040
quicklook/thumbnail.jpg jfif @exif aynd

89
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,020
that just just use the five command

90
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,210
being and

91
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,620
and of our folders so yeah I'm not sure

92
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,270
how visible that is but it's just a

93
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,280
directory with in many other different

94
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,340
caches there and within that directory

95
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,789
we have from three to seven files

96
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,800
because there are some additional file

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,000
SQLite files being created so you can

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,919
see the ones that we are interested in

99
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:52,310
the most is the s key index dot SQLite

100
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,380
database and another one that's

101
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,389
important it's pump it's companyís dot

102
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:01,250
data so index dot SQLite is a a database

103
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,270
which has all the metadata about files

104
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,160
that thumbnails are created for and

105
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,919
about from players and funders the data

106
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,580
is just raw data the the thumbnails

107
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,120
themselves just in a big data blob and

108
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,220
it's really it would be really difficult

109
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,750
to to parse from knows the data without

110
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,910
having the index dot SQLite because all

111
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,760
of these images are in PNG format but

112
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,500
they are stripped from from file

113
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,419
signatures so you can't really carve it

114
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:35,990
out easily

115
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,360
that's why you need that index dot

116
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,070
SQLite where you have the offsets and

117
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,659
then you can you can easily find where

118
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:46,970
your thumbnails are so let's take a look

119
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:52,520
at index dot SQLite so again there's

120
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,270
five tables inside that database file

121
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,130
spending secure delete buffer

122
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,169
preferences reserved buffer and firmness

123
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,270
and again we are most interested in

124
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,560
files and thumbnails so let's look at

125
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,050
both of them what's what's the structure

126
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,340
of these and first the files table gives

127
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,810
us some juicy data so we can see the

128
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,080
path so it also often includes volume

129
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,599
name so the path to the original file so

130
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,630
in there in the files table we see

131
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,190
information about the file so by the

132
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,440
file I mean the original file that the

133
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,960
family was made for not just the phone

134
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,779
now so then family file name obviously

135
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:38,450
and then FS ID which includes

136
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,009
volume ID and then

137
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:42,710
. and then a file ID within that volume

138
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,680
so i will show you examples in in a bit

139
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,659
where you will be able to see that in

140
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:50,180
practice let's say and then in the

141
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,889
firmness table there's a lot a lot

142
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:56,119
fields a lot of this is is used to be

143
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:59,210
able to locate and locate where the

144
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,119
funnel is within the data block but the

145
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,649
ones that we are interested in from

146
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:06,080
forensic point of view is the number of

147
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,240
times the five thumbnail was accessed so

148
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,149
that's the hit code and last time the

149
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:13,490
family was accessed so last hit date

150
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,469
so obviously that can give us some

151
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:18,460
insight in what was done on the machine

152
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,860
so let's let's think of like how does

153
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,870
the thumbnail end up in the cache so

154
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,719
like we go into the crash with you the

155
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,849
database and we see some files but how

156
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,409
did it get there what do you have to do

157
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:34,459
to make a to make a file like make a

158
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:37,279
thumbnail for itself so basically every

159
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,520
time you you see a file yourself so

160
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,039
whether it's on desktop or it is in a

161
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,659
folder and you open it and find there

162
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,189
every time you actually see that file

163
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:48,699
and you see the funder for it it will be

164
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:53,029
it will be created and also if you open

165
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:55,519
a folder which for example has 300

166
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,309
images then the thumbnails will be made

167
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:59,629
for all of them even though you'll

168
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:01,909
probably see maybe 10 only because of

169
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:05,719
your of your window size so actually but

170
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,399
all my experiments were done on a very

171
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:11,149
very not powerful VM so if I open the

172
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:12,979
file sometimes it would take a couple of

173
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,219
seconds for you know the thumbnail to be

174
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:17,930
created so for example I haven't had a

175
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,459
picture and there was only like this

176
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:23,180
this white page let's say thumbnail

177
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,849
place place horrid placeholder so it

178
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:27,229
would take a while for the thumbnail to

179
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:29,149
actually get produced and if I was quick

180
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,830
and just collected the cash before it

181
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,169
then it wouldn't it it would nothing

182
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,958
would be there yet so basically when you

183
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,448
CFM though it means that it it got

184
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:41,240
caster so let's look for a cup at a

185
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,089
couple of examples so for example here I

186
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,880
have a very very easy scenario I have

187
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,589
two folders and both of these folders

188
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:51,439
are on the same machine so it's it has

189
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:53,029
nothing to do with networking or

190
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:53,930
anything

191
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,940
there is a folder code files and there

192
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,560
are two files in them to copy and to

193
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,079
move I'm taking the to move file and

194
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:03,350
moving it dragging it to new folder and

195
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,870
then I'm collecting the cash and looking

196
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,589
at the index dot SQLite so when you look

197
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:12,110
inside index dot SQLite you can actually

198
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,420
see three records and you remember we

199
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,230
only had we only had two files so in the

200
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,410
fandom we can see that there are two two

201
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,220
entries for to move one is in when you

202
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,170
look at the folder part one is in files

203
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,560
one is in new folder so there are two

204
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,269
separate entries even though it's the

205
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:37,699
same file that we have moved but when we

206
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:42,139
look at the file ID and FS ID where we

207
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:44,209
have the volume ID and the file ID these

208
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,790
are the same numbers so you can easily

209
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,860
link link them together and see that

210
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,740
this is the same file just have has been

211
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,529
moved somewhere else so example number

212
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:56,750
two is when you have an external device

213
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,130
and you are moving a a five from from

214
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,230
the external device to your machine so

215
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,680
here I have USB storage just a USB stick

216
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,680
there's a very important secret image

217
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,720
called hacking jpg on it and I'm just

218
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,029
dragging it on the desktop and then

219
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:16,790
looking at the cache so here's still the

220
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:21,199
file I have to two entries and in the in

221
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:25,009
the cache and both of these obviously

222
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:27,709
the file name is the same but you know

223
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:29,959
the thumbnail can be the same for two as

224
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,360
always but you can see that the file IDs

225
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,089
are different both the volume ID and the

226
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:37,759
file ID is different because it has been

227
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,680
moved from an external device so it

228
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,810
wasn't just an operation on our machine

229
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,699
and for exact little example renaming a

230
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:48,920
file we changed the file that we changed

231
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,720
the name of the file I literally took a

232
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,310
screenshot if you haven't much you know

233
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,370
it just gets saved with this weird name

234
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,670
format with the live the date and the

235
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:03,199
time when it was taken and then you then

236
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:05,600
I changed the name to name changed

237
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,150
again two entries and you can see that

238
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,150
the file ID volume ID and the file ID

239
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,290
are the same here that's an interesting

240
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,090
one what happens when you delete a file

241
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,420
so here I just created two txt files

242
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,550
because based on my research they also

243
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,580
produce thumbnails the the I only put

244
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,350
test string in it so you can't see it

245
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,530
but if you zoomed in really really

246
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,180
precisely you would see that actually

247
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,280
the layout of the document is reflected

248
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,170
by the thumbnails so you can kind of see

249
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,300
if I had the word document with the huge

250
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,830
pictures and you could see it in the

251
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,450
front nail so it does give you some

252
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,730
information about what's inside so I

253
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,610
have two text files or a test string in

254
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,610
them then I put them in trash and then I

255
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,500
click on the trash open the trash and

256
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,690
click empty trash so that it's super

257
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,080
deleted right so then I go to the cache

258
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,780
and what it actually did was create yet

259
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,080
another entry in in the cache for each

260
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,960
of the files where you can see that the

261
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,840
folder bit says that it's desktop first

262
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,660
and then trash so if you want to be

263
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,430
extra careful and you'll go into the

264
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,850
trash and delete their contents it only

265
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,170
increases the footprint of that file in

266
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,790
the cache because it creates yet another

267
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,750
from them so don't do that if you if you

268
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:28,370
don't want to be exposed okay so why do

269
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,430
we care about this at all why why are we

270
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,860
looking at at the cache so first of all

271
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,180
in its quick be and fast to copy because

272
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,470
it's quite small in my on my environment

273
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,510
my test environment that I have prepared

274
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,270
which isn't very powerful it was only

275
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,990
growing up to 500 megabytes and when it

276
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,210
reached 500 megabytes it will just reset

277
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,270
back to the start so it was just I know

278
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,040
it's weird I almost I also thought that

279
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,960
maybe it would intelligently switch

280
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,430
things around but no it just deletes

281
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,230
itself and starts at zero megabyte

282
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,320
second so anyway that's just half half a

283
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,600
gigabyte it's quick quick to copy when

284
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,480
you especially when you when you

285
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,460
appreciate like how much inside you it

286
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,680
can give you into what the user has done

287
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,220
on the

288
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,410
that's what digital forensics is by the

289
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:26,080
way it gives you a very very useful

290
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,970
insight and what the user has has been

291
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:29,990
doing on the machine

292
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,260
so obviously it's much better than if

293
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,430
you have a huge a huge machine with a

294
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,980
huge amount of data then it's much much

295
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,540
faster to just go through the cache

296
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,090
first even if it's just for triage you

297
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,190
can still do it much faster than try to

298
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,260
check every file especially when you're

299
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,350
interested in what was done recently on

300
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,600
the computer and also a regular user

301
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,240
probably wouldn't think to delete it so

302
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,250
you would first like a regulars and

303
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,900
would first just try to delete things

304
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,210
you know just put them in the trash and

305
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,880
then empty the trash maybe if they are

306
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,620
super smart but they probably wouldn't

307
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,530
think to to go and delete the cache so

308
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,680
obviously it's no no it's not very

309
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,820
surprising that that people started

310
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,580
researching and and thinking what what

311
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,640
can be done with this so this is very

312
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,140
important addition to this slide so in

313
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,670
2000 and 2018 a security researcher

314
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,580
called Wojtek Inagua has published a

315
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,910
blog post about how the cache can leak

316
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,020
information from your encrypted and

317
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,240
encrypted drives so this is another QR

318
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,580
code to that blog post if you if you

319
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,450
wanna take a look at it so he basically

320
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,130
realized that when you plug in a an

321
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,710
encrypted password-protected drive to

322
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,380
your computer and then view the contents

323
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,240
of it and then eject it and take it away

324
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,089
the the thumbnails will still persist in

325
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:07,280
the cache even after it's ejected so

326
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,490
obviously that's a huge huge high

327
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,610
security concern so obviously a lot of

328
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,190
people weren't interested in it and the

329
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,160
the guys just died like a master student

330
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,410
as my master student in Poland but it's

331
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,560
got a huge coverage and different like

332
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,660
hacking news and tech reader all these

333
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,400
security blocks you can see there's a

334
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,089
lot and also security forums so

335
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:36,509
obviously there was a lot of a lot of

336
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:39,029
pressure on Apple to do something with

337
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:42,419
it and fix it somehow in the next next

338
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:44,189
operating system version which was

339
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:47,579
Mojave so what did they do they just

340
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,599
included

341
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:51,749
they just included the thumbnail cache

342
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:53,789
under their system integrity protection

343
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:56,129
so it means that basically you cannot do

344
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:59,279
anything with that file so you go into

345
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,689
the cache and you have different caches

346
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:03,209
and some of them including now thumbnail

347
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:06,569
caches it's just an accessible to you it

348
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:08,639
you cannot copy it you cannot delete it

349
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,759
you cannot move it you cannot run file

350
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,469
on it to see what it is like you can't

351
00:16:13,469 --> 00:16:15,089
just you have no permissions to do

352
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:21,749
anything so there is a way to to kind of

353
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:24,179
bypass it great because the system

354
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:25,889
integrity protection can be turned off

355
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,749
you can just put it into safe mode and

356
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:31,699
disable it from the terminal there so

357
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,289
then you you just have access to the

358
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:36,179
cache and you can analyze it as I have

359
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:39,269
shown before and even though they have

360
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:42,779
fixed the the encrypted drive owner

361
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:44,699
ability so now when something's equipted

362
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,769
you you plug it in your view the stuff

363
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:48,689
it doesn't get saved in the cache still

364
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:51,179
if you plug a USB stick in and you plug

365
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:53,219
it out which isn't password protected

366
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:55,889
not encrypted then it persists still if

367
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,979
you are sharing a a folder within your

368
00:16:58,979 --> 00:17:01,829
network then it still gets gets saved

369
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:04,019
and persists there so deleted files

370
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:06,329
still stay there so it's only this one

371
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,039
thing that they thought of but nothing

372
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,809
else so hence this like so you may think

373
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:15,209
ok so how is that useful because I just

374
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:17,849
told you that that they have made this

375
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:20,249
system integrity protection on this on

376
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:22,470
this directory so you are not able to

377
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,829
access it in any way well you need what

378
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,118
you really need is the root password

379
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:30,509
because after after you boot into safe

380
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,899
mode you need to reboot and oh and then

381
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:36,149
and then access obviously the the root

382
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:38,220
account again so there is a number of

383
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,379
scenarios where you actually do have

384
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:42,869
access to to the root account for

385
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:45,299
example when it's your machine so if you

386
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,900
are an employee

387
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,960
and or for example a new University

388
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,600
anytime it's your machine and you can

389
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,600
still you can do all of these things as

390
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,550
long as you have the main control of it

391
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,220
another thing you could also think about

392
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,140
it in a way that you can trick a person

393
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,000
to use your computer and then be able to

394
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,420
to reconstruct their behavior based on

395
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:13,780
the cache so I have a couple of -

396
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,440
actually - real-life examples of of this

397
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,179
working so I have read many many

398
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,010
different court cases while working on

399
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,440
my dissertation to look for something

400
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,340
that would kind of touch upon this this

401
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,840
topic so what I found is that their

402
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,260
approaches to the funnel caches and also

403
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,179
in general to digital evidence but

404
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:43,300
thumbnail caches in in particular they

405
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,410
differ greatly because of lack of kind

406
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,270
of standardized and well researched

407
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,730
knowledge about how they work so instead

408
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,050
of instead of treating the you know the

409
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,790
the fact that there is something in the

410
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,650
cache as evidence that for example you

411
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,590
have viewed or the you know whoever is

412
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,160
being charged you'd something indecent

413
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,230
for example on their computer they

414
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,920
treated us possession or making of this

415
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,059
indecent contents so for example if

416
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:19,900
there there's what first case I'm going

417
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,090
to talk about is the Regina versus

418
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,910
Porter so there's a case number on there

419
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,010
you can take a picture and and google it

420
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:27,910
later if you want

421
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,850
so basically in both cases that I'm

422
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,590
going to talk about these are men who

423
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,550
got charged already with with possession

424
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:41,340
of of indecent images and in this case

425
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:47,620
the guy had over 3,000 the over 3,000

426
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,590
companies were recovered from his from

427
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,070
his computer showing some indecent

428
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:58,740
indecent content and he then appealed to

429
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,140
around two twenty-seven twenty-seven

430
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,380
hundred of them where we're recovered

431
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,360
using a special software which were

432
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,179
which was kind of lent to to the UK by

433
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,880
the US government so he appealed the

434
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,059
charge and said that because you needed

435
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:22,020
this special software it like the the

436
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,190
contents were not available to him

437
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,870
because he wouldn't be able to see this

438
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,450
twenty seven hundred photos because they

439
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,280
were only available when you cuz

440
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,990
obviously he deleted them at some point

441
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,929
before they were only available using

442
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:37,419
them using the specialized software and

443
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:43,440
he he actually did he did actually get

444
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,720
like his appeal was granted and he was

445
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,000
found not guilty he was found guilty of

446
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,070
possessing other ones that were easily

447
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,760
accessible but this one but you know

448
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,679
it's like it seems funny but when you

449
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:58,480
when you think about the difference if

450
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,730
he had like eight hundred or you know

451
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,150
over three thousand three wasn't

452
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,220
indecent photos then it's a different

453
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,130
kind of magnitude of a crime right so he

454
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,200
actually want that little bit and they

455
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,210
did say okay it wasn't accessible to you

456
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,130
because you would need that special

457
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,559
software on the other hand though there

458
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:20,110
was another case regina versus

459
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,530
Christopher Brown where the guy was

460
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:27,419
found he appealed his charge as well and

461
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,880
he said that the the fact that the

462
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,429
thumbnails were on his computer were

463
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:36,970
because because he has downloaded them

464
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,240
and he he just he said that he did not

465
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,429
view the pictures at all so this is

466
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:44,650
again if there was standardized and well

467
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,030
researched knowledge about how the

468
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,090
family caches work then obviously that

469
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,809
that could be proven untrue like basing

470
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:55,240
it on whatever operating system he was

471
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,820
using because you need to view the the

472
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,909
file for in order to for the family to

473
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:06,309
be made so he did not he did not have

474
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:10,270
have his appeal granted because the jury

475
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,559
and the judge has found

476
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:14,049
that the firm nails were big enough for

477
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:16,360
him to be able to enjoy the content

478
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,509
anyway so he was found guilty but you

479
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:21,309
can see these two cases are very similar

480
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:24,669
but still you know still there were two

481
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:27,129
very different approaches and I just

482
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:30,340
find that it's it's really weird that no

483
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,590
one is actually treating thumbnails as

484
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,570
evidence which is basically what it is

485
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:39,070
more than actual positions of wealth you

486
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,809
know illegal content okay so that's

487
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:45,850
that's the end of my talk thank you very

488
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,679
much I won't be question taking

489
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,059
questions here but if you have any

490
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:51,129
questions please tweet me or ask me in

491
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:53,769
the pub later and all the resources and

492
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:56,649
