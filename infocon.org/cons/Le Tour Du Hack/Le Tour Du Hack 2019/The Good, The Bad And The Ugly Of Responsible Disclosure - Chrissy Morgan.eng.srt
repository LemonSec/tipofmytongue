1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,230
thanks guys thank you so as you can see

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,670
I'm gonna be talking about the good the

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,219
bad and the ugly of coordinated

4
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:14,019
disclosure and I'll get into a bit of

5
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:15,180
that later on

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,840
so first up Docs to myself Who am I I am

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,840
NOT a big fan of these lights but we'll

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,120
say is I've had a really good year and

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,400
if you're interested in anything that

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,960
I've done and saw more about my

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,760
background you can head over to my blog

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,680
and you can always hit me up on Twitter

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,600
with any questions or anything at all

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,329
and what I'd like to speak about today

15
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:41,140
is more about the background and the

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,089
stuff that people don't hear me talking

17
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:45,159
about because I can't most of the time

18
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:48,699
and so it's more of the circumstances

19
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:50,710
around disclosure and my personal

20
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,679
experiences and if you can take

21
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,640
something from that that'd be brilliant

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,089
so disclaimer back in my head at the

23
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:03,010
moment I'm thinking this is a really

24
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,199
terrible idea but at the same

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,810
time you know I'm not a lawyer or a

26
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,500
vulnerability disclosure expert please

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,420
take anything you feel when you see

28
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,850
today and you know make some good use of

29
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,009
it a lot of you here will be students

30
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:19,930
and you'll be learning some bits and

31
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,460
pieces that I didn't when I first got

32
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,030
into it please don't go out and hack

33
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,280
systems that you have no authorize

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,880
reason to do so and you know don't use

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,670
any of the stuff that I have here today

36
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,079
with regards to justification for doing

37
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:40,659
that it's first up a history lesson this

38
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:43,210
is Alfred Charles Hobbes I would call

39
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,299
him a bit of a old school hacker now

40
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:49,539
what he did back in 1853 was pick locks

41
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:52,240
and what he would do here we go around

42
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,009
finding the best locks of that day and

43
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,310
time and he would set himself challenges

44
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,140
and breaking those locks and he would

45
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,060
he'd actually get into them and you know

46
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,719
it caused a bit of fuss was doing it now

47
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,880
at the Great Exhibition in Crystal

48
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,739
Palace in 1853 he was set a challenge to

49
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:13,150
break one of the locks it was a bronze

50
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,230
lock

51
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,470
and the manufacturers gave him a set of

52
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,140
blank keys and a lock and said you have

53
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,250
30 days in which to break this lock now

54
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,440
Alfred here he's pretty good at what

55
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,640
does and he managed to do it in 24 days

56
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,280
of course there was a big fan for her

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,860
about it but what did the manufacturers

58
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,280
do they took it negatively and they

59
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,310
actually turned around and said well the

60
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,500
lock was broken there was something

61
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,959
wrong with it they didn't believe for a

62
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,530
minute that they were at fault now this

63
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,860
caused a lot of controversy and Alfred

64
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,950
wasn't shy of controversy at all he then

65
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,380
went on to publish a paper that detailed

66
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,170
all the different problems with the

67
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,630
locks of those days the vulnerabilities

68
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,530
and also detailed about safes he felt in

69
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,530
his mind that people needed to know

70
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,560
about him and you can see here rogues

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,750
are very keen in their profession and

72
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,569
know already much more than we can teach

73
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:22,299
them so he's basically saying the bad

74
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:24,250
guys know this stuff so what we should

75
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,290
do is like the public know about it so

76
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:32,410
they can best protect themselves so how

77
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,450
do you let people know about the

78
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,389
problems now there are a couple of

79
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:40,090
different ways of disclosure first one

80
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,350
is non-disclosure and this can be a case

81
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,549
of where you're working for a company

82
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:47,500
and they've been told to do some

83
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,019
research or a security test on a vendor

84
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:51,639
like a product or something like that

85
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,220
and you'll sign a contract it'll be you

86
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,180
cannot talk about those problems also in

87
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,370
addition to this you have people

88
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,920
researchers who will find out about

89
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,569
problems and they will keep it to

90
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:07,720
themselves you'll have government

91
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,130
organizations find out about these

92
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,599
problems and they will stockpile them

93
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:16,120
for their own good you also have people

94
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,779
who will possibly get into a NDA with a

95
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,570
zero-day organisation who buy these

96
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,940
vulnerabilities

97
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,310
but basically the point is you keep

98
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,760
mouth shut

99
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,000
which brings us on to our next one

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,980
coordinated disclosure so when I started

101
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,080
doing my slides and I was talking to

102
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,750
people on Twitter one of the guys that I

103
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,880
was talking with he said oh actually I

104
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,860
called it responsible discussion he said

105
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,300
well actually some of the people want to

106
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,150
call it coordinated me explain why and

107
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,880
some of the reasons were is that

108
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,900
responsible disclosure might send the

109
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,500
wrong signal some people prefer it but

110
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,140
coordinated with something that

111
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,540
Microsoft kind of pushed for when one of

112
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,340
their own actually published a report

113
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,740
some years back on the whole subject of

114
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,640
full disclosure

115
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,280
so now industry's adopted coordinated

116
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,530
which shows pretty much everyone's

117
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,770
working all together on something so the

118
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,920
purpose of this is when you'll find

119
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,170
something you're reported to the vendor

120
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,110
and you'll go through a process it's a

121
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,720
two-way thing and there could be other

122
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,600
parties involved

123
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,910
you could have bug bounty programs or

124
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,550
maybe some external agency like the FBI

125
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,430
now there are some problems with

126
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,000
coordinated disclosure we have pretty

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,260
much a waiting game us as researchers

128
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,810
have to disclose our vulnerabilities and

129
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,590
then we wait now Google zero they have

130
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,710
theirs as 90 days and then they'll

131
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,470
release but as you can see from here

132
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,390
that timeline can extend so you know it

133
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,790
could be in a think up to eight eight

134
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,800
months there some of mine are nine

135
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,370
months nearly enough a year and that

136
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,650
shows in its sense that you have to have

137
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,130
some level patience but if you don't

138
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,570
want to have patience and you just want

139
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,320
to get out there

140
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,790
here comes full disclosure

141
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,720
so I have it's in full disclosure it is

142
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,260
a case of yeah dropping it like it's hot

143
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,480
you will see this where guys will go on

144
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,139
to Twitter

145
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:36,700
they'll have blog post and they'll

146
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,650
release and it's released for the most

147
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,980
public exposure possible now their

148
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,070
motives may be one of their own exposure

149
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,590
for credibility within the industry for

150
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,910
their own ego or it could be because

151
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,020
they actually want to let the public

152
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,250
know about this to better protect

153
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,290
themselves going back to our Fred's

154
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,220
point but this can get you into some

155
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,990
bother and a lot of trouble

156
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,810
understandably vendors don't always like

157
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,550
here when you go full disclosure on them

158
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,720
and this isn't something that's new so

159
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,650
here's pizza psycho ok Lodge much from

160
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,510
the loft and he's actually part of the

161
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,760
loft hacker collective and the cult of

162
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,150
the dead cow I'm just going to play this

163
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:36,400
video as get run out on any city that's

164
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,010
crimes as a group the cult of the dead

165
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,900
cow gained worldwide attention for

166
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,910
releasing hacking tools that let users

167
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,700
take control of Windows software forcing

168
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,010
Microsoft to confront security problems

169
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,620
with its programs I've released several

170
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,419
security advisories on various pieces of

171
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:54,700
commercial software which have prompted

172
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,400
vendor patches which means they improved

173
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,990
the software after we pointed it out to

174
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,729
them unfortunately many times they would

175
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:04,870
not improve the software until we

176
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,419
actually went public with the findings

177
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,640
companies do indeed want to ignore

178
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,500
problems as long as possible it's

179
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,729
cheaper for them wait

180
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,010
oops sorry my bad

181
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:41,740
go back a slide not be like I'm a new

182
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:48,040
virilis stuff okay let's see is it on

183
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,980
fullscreen though it's not is it it was

184
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,150
okay let's go back then right

185
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,160
I'll just leave like that for the moment

186
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,520
um so basically what we have there we

187
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,100
have him saying 20 years ago mind you

188
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,150
that the only way you get things to

189
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,230
change was to go full disclosure and as

190
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,520
you if you were at the bear farmers

191
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,740
talked earlier on you would have seen

192
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,840
some incidents where people have come

193
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,290
out about issues and we're still having

194
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,980
it this day and age you know researchers

195
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,900
are either getting frustrated or feel

196
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,850
the need to go full disclosure in public

197
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,420
and the problem is as well we have laws

198
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,510
that are being used from the 80s and

199
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,400
they don't give us any kind of

200
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,620
protection either so what will happen is

201
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,280
we will then end up in a lawsuit to be

202
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,790
fair and part of this problem is

203
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,199
sometimes it's really hard to navigate

204
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,360
not only do we have the laws to think

205
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,450
about we have standards and then the

206
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,860
vendors will implement their own Terms

207
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,850
of Service you look at a product and

208
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,430
Katie's even helped the bug bounty

209
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,940
community really really like a lot and

210
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,260
there are now bug bounty programs that

211
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,660
help researchers who want to explore and

212
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,190
have a look at things but admit she had

213
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,020
a look into things as she saw the Terms

214
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,880
of Service in one of the vendors

215
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,490
products for bidded someone from being

216
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,950
able to investigate

217
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,810
now that's within a bug bounty program

218
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,890
that's somewhere we're supposed to be

219
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,360
allowed to have a play but yet the Terms

220
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,050
of Service contradict it so what we need

221
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,880
ourselves we need a lot more safe

222
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,040
harbors places

223
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,200
we're free to research and have a look

224
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,390
we need a clearer understanding of the

225
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,880
term service all the end-user license

226
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,160
agreements the laws and we need some

227
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,710
guidance for it and here I've got

228
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,730
emitters alazhari I've also got mischeif

229
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,550
who Saskia and she's in the UK and she's

230
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,460
been looking at standards and laws and

231
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,010
she's really good kind of like putting

232
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,280
big red circles around wording and you

233
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,810
know pointed out and she's helping us in

234
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,740
that regard and also Katie at the end

235
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:19,990
there so what do we do we have this thin

236
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,100
line that we could cross anytime we have

237
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,110
laws that say to us so you can or you

238
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,910
can and this is how you go about it and

239
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,790
there is not much guidance at all but

240
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,620
then we also have this issue where we've

241
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,360
been going through something with a

242
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,810
vendor and we may face problems they may

243
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,990
drive us crazy we may get very

244
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,570
frustrated and it then Bulls down to a

245
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,560
moral compass of that person I've I know

246
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,420
friends who are really good researchers

247
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,820
and stuff and they've had to drop stuff

248
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,370
and you know make it public and or

249
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,290
they've had to sell how many now no guys

250
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,310
have turn around to me said yeah

251
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,690
security research is doing really well

252
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,830
you know they do talks and everything

253
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,930
else but I've never known one person not

254
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,140
to do badly by selling zero-days you

255
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,930
know if it's less problems why wouldn't

256
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,290
you but then it's a moral guidance and I

257
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,030
love this word anonyme it's the

258
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,560
condition in which society provides

259
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,180
little moral guidance from individuals

260
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,070
and I think we have some of that within

261
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,530
our industry and we need guidance from

262
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,140
our peers and our the people above us to

263
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,760
help us know what to do in certain

264
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,210
circumstances now if you don't want any

265
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,920
of those problems sometimes you head

266
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,570
over to the bug bounty programs and it's

267
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,970
very good you can go and enter and work

268
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,530
with a vendor and they'll have a triage

269
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,600
process and everything will go quite

270
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
well and then you may get a pop payout

271
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,330
but then you may also get a dupe or a

272
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,650
big class or something like in

273
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,470
information it's not relevant you get

274
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,540
nothing so

275
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,580
you spent maybe you know nights or weeks

276
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:56,340
even on something for nothing but some

277
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,050
people in recognition and that's fine

278
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,370
and some people want payouts and the

279
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,230
financial problems though the finance

280
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,860
with it

281
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,990
I think the bug bounty programs

282
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,970
themselves have actually led to possibly

283
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,530
and expected expectation of like having

284
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,250
money and that can lead to extortion now

285
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,650
one of the problems that we've had to

286
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,740
come up it's quite an interesting case

287
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,270
was uber uber had a bug bounty program

288
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,870
and their payout was ten thousand now

289
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,180
that's fantastic you find a problem with

290
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,510
uber you get 10 grand these kids found a

291
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,390
problem with uber they then proceeded to

292
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:41,100
download 50 million users details they

293
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,100
then approached uber and said 10k I

294
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,900
don't think so I want more and they got

295
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,030
away with it

296
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,610
uber caved in and I needed to behave in

297
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,010
they also got into other like legal

298
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,630
problems because they hid the fact they

299
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,610
happen um but they actually caved in so

300
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,020
these guys thought you know he's

301
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,240
brilliant I'm now gonna go ahead and do

302
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,890
it to someone else just what exactly

303
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,170
what they did and then they got arrested

304
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,550
for extortion you know but the president

305
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,750
was set they thought they could get away

306
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:21,740
with it and do it what we have today is

307
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,460
standard so we have the ISO 29 147 and

308
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:55,350
the ISO 3166 and there are really valid

309
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,450
valuable documents to actually look at

310
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,260
and read so you can actually get the

311
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,980
tooth

312
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,400
14 version for free Katie made sure that

313
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,890
people could get hold of this

314
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,790
unfortunately it wasn't long before the

315
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,560
2018 version came I've got all three

316
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,760
versions I compared the 2014 version to

317
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,480
the 2018 with a different tool and there

318
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,540
was extensive changes not just the page

319
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,670
count but you had the scope that was

320
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,110
different the terminology that was

321
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,970
different

322
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,190
mention of stakeholders reading through

323
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,170
it it's a brilliant document but reading

324
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,610
through it didn't feel like he was

325
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,310
written for us it feels like it was

326
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,750
written for the vendors and the

327
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,400
companies and fair enough there is no

328
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,780
standards that's who they should be

329
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,940
written for but the same time what do we

330
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,610
have but if you're gonna get into bug

331
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,110
Bannion programs or you're gonna get

332
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,880
into vulnerability disclosure please go

333
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,330
and read these because it will help so

334
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,990
the one on the iso twenty nine one four

335
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,560
seven on this side

336
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,780
that's how vendors would deal with a

337
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,840
external vulnerability disclosure to

338
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:12,030
them and the 3111 works with that in a

339
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,880
sense and it it deals with the internal

340
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,600
processes and I've had to watch talks

341
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,550
and I've had to read different papers

342
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,430
and around that see kind of understand

343
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,790
what these documents do because half the

344
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,260
time when you read in terms of service

345
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,450
and legal stuff and ISO standards if

346
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,520
you're not from like you just don't

347
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,800
understand it you can read it however

348
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,720
there are some really good people like I

349
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,050
said before you have Katie and you have

350
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,510
Amit and they're actually lowering the

351
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,820
entry of being able to understand this

352
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,690
stuff with some of the talks that

353
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,840
they've done that's one of the diagrams

354
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,090
from one of the standards that diagram

355
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,030
appears in both standards and it shows

356
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,880
the flow of what happens in in

357
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,710
circumstances of whether it's external

358
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,800
or whether it comes in internally and it

359
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,319
shows them how to deal with it because

360
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,000
some of the times we will report a

361
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,640
vulnerability to a company and they

362
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,290
won't have a vulnerability management

363
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,790
program at all in fact they won't even

364
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,700
know what to do with it at all

365
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,839
at that a lot so yeah please check out

366
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,599
their talks they're really good and

367
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:26,910
these girls brilliant they're so spot

368
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,890
the difference this is the cirque guide

369
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,990
very similar document it's not an iso

370
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,290
standard it's a guide more of a report

371
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,200
but it shows the flow from the finder

372
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,570
who would be us security researchers and

373
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,550
then you've also got the finder on the

374
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,510
iso standard also so there are some

375
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,820
differences between them that one there

376
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,590
looks more complex but there's also

377
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,220
something that's the same can anyone

378
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:08,640
tell me what might be the same no before

379
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,430
Andy if you have a look if you have a

380
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,680
look at the finder you'll see that the

381
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,810
arrows are one way the communication

382
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,880
doesn't never go back to the finder so

383
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,830
we have vendors who actually reading

384
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,360
these documents looking at the diagrams

385
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,370
to make sense of this stuff and they're

386
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,780
getting the wrong visual cues it yeah

387
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,440
exactly

388
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,240
it doesn't make sense and Saskia

389
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,560
originally brought this up in her talk

390
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,780
and I looked at it and I thought right

391
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,550
okay she's worried hundred percent and I

392
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,700
had looked at sir and they were the same

393
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,600
however sir a very receptive of

394
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,260
amendments and changes now Allen reached

395
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,850
out to me on Twitter when he knew I was

396
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,210
doing my talk and I'll tell you one

397
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,430
thing yeah being able to speak to

398
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,960
someone who's actually an author of one

399
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,840
of these documents firsthand when I know

400
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,150
the the loopholes that you have to jump

401
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,070
through to even get any changes or speak

402
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,570
to people with regards to the ISO

403
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,960
standards I find out the ISO standards

404
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,370
people the other day and they said right

405
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,020
you need to speak to the BSA I find up

406
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,340
the BSI this is right you need to write

407
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,990
us an email we'll forward it through to

408
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,790
the right people because it's the people

409
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,490
who like Cisco Microsoft all these big

410
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,020
companies who are dealing with it

411
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,610
you don't get that one-to-one

412
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,500
communication as a researchers be like

413
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,590
I've got an idea will you do something

414
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,720
these guys broke to me on Twitter I told

415
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,120
him I said can you look at the arrows

416
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,640
sure yeah all the arrows are pointing

417
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,170
away from the finder nothing goes back

418
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,450
it's like sure no problem next revision

419
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,700
gonna get changed so small wins right

420
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,610
it's also very readable it's realistic

421
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,460
and it feels like it's being actually

422
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,680
written for our security researchers the

423
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,060
first time I've read something I've been

424
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,750
like I totally agree with this unless it

425
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,790
does feel less bureaucratic overall I

426
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:10,590
sat down with a bunch of guys online and

427
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,390
we had a look and their mixture of hats

428
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,940
and for the first time had a bunch of

429
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,110
hackers talking about Lauren

430
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,060
legalization and standards and they

431
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,350
loved it you know they said yeah a

432
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,000
hundred percent they agree with the

433
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,140
stuff that was in there and they were

434
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,390
really happy that standards and stuff

435
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,060
are moving forwards to help them so

436
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,240
please go and download it it's free so

437
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,190
you don't have to pay for it to 121

438
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,140
pages and it's a really good read really

439
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:46,500
good read so I need a drink of water

440
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,990
before I start this part I need a

441
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,200
whiskey as well so as you know this talk

442
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,450
is about the good the bad and the ugly

443
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,560
and because I wanted to end up on a high

444
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,230
I started with the ugly first I didn't

445
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,780
want to depress anyone so we're gonna

446
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,550
start with the ugly and the first one up

447
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:15,450
is who is calm so it's my first ever bug

448
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,270
yeah go me I had no idea what I was

449
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,200
doing at all and I found it pretty much

450
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,430
by accident I was sat online one night I

451
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,560
had my VPN on I was doing some awesome

452
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,800
work and I had a check it was checking

453
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,080
out some details basically I put a

454
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,460
website into who is and for some reason

455
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,620
all the details are showing

456
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,140
annealer to be true with some American

457
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,510
sites and stuff like that but post GDP

458
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,179
are you shouldn't be able to put a UK

459
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:51,450
site in and get details right that's not

460
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:56,039
right at all so I was like okay I'm

461
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,960
stupid I've done something wrong so when

462
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,840
and I did another domain name and that

463
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,250
one all the details were redacted hang

464
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,809
on a minute I went back to the other one

465
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:10,260
and the details were redacted was I seen

466
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:15,029
things no I checked through the code and

467
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:17,309
I could see what they were doing so

468
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:20,130
basically what they were doing was when

469
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,070
you did a request they were actually

470
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,049
sending through and pulling another page

471
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:28,409
called requests PHP now that this

472
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:31,440
request PHP page would then update the

473
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,149
the website page with all the details

474
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:36,049
and since gdpr what it's been doing is

475
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:38,279
refreshed in the database so then it

476
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:41,580
just shows all as redacted but because I

477
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,830
was on a shitty VPN and the connection

478
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,840
was so slow by the time it got to me it

479
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,770
hasn't got through so I was like okay I

480
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,090
found something possibly and it dawned

481
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,520
on me holy like this is post UDP oh

482
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,929
we've got all these people status I know

483
00:22:57,929 --> 00:22:59,190
there were there previously but

484
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,809
afterwards this is kind of like a bit of

485
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:05,940
a breach so I sat down and I wrote some

486
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,179
code that would go through who is calm

487
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,029
and their entire database and grab all

488
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:15,240
of the domain names and all of the

489
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,730
details as well just as a proof of

490
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,360
concept

491
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,760
not for nothing nefarious at all and I

492
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,779
issued an email to them I tried to get

493
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:30,270
hold of the right people I was having no

494
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,820
luck I spoke to one of the chat agents

495
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,929
and he wanted me to give everything to

496
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:35,610
him over the like the plane and I'm like

497
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,970
no not happening can you put me through

498
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,130
to someone I literally I was it was it

499
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,990
was a bit bull like to prepare so what

500
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,470
did I do

501
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,870
newbee started how I went through to a

502
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:51,030
disclosure Assistance Program and it was

503
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,789
an experience in itself

504
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:57,899
barony - cited this in July 2018 and I'm

505
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:01,230
still emailing people now I'm going to

506
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,750
show you the actual a video of it

507
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:16,590
happening see as you can see here and

508
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,690
pull in the details you've got the name

509
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:24,720
address postcode all the registration

510
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,490
states I did it once twice three times

511
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,899
for luck just to prove that I could do

512
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:33,409
it and I was saving these details to a

513
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:37,710
little file and as you can see I've

514
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,090
actually called it domain protect

515
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,190
because what I was trying to do then was

516
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,649
figure out a way of how I could protect

517
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,779
these details if who is calm will let in

518
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:47,760
anyone be able to do this and I surely

519
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,840
wasn't probably the only person doing

520
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,700
this how could I figure out a way to

521
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,500
code in a protection mechanism so it

522
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,950
pulled the details so what happens now

523
00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:07,340
is I go to the same domain do my search

524
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:16,140
yeah I've got she ain't that right and

525
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,950
see it's showing the details but what

526
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,870
you'll see up in the top corner it says

527
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,240
updated three hundred and forty days ago

528
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,760
and that's the little indicator just

529
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,100
tell me that I was actually having a

530
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:38,010
successful find so if we go back just to

531
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:43,250
show you and I'll try and bring that up

532
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,609
[Music]

533
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,550
if you look again on the top hand corner

534
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,650
you'll see a little round dis thing it's

535
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,030
got cop dated three hundred forty days

536
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,740
ago and that's how I knew that it was

537
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,860
actually working well because that was

538
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,720
all part and parcel tied into the strip

539
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,540
the there refresh PHP so there I go

540
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:11,360
again I've pulled it again oh so when I

541
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:17,260
do my bad

542
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,290
Co the registering contact details are

543
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:29,060
there I run my script pulls the details

544
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,140
again I go back to the site I let it run

545
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,260
through and then all the details

546
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,100
disappear because it's been updated I've

547
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,280
run the code and it can't pull any

548
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:56,440
details awesome

549
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:02,360
so who is dot-com if I was who is and I

550
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,680
had someone telling me about I'd be

551
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:09,560
really interested I possibly breach but

552
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,850
it's been a matter of delayed responses

553
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,320
it's been broken down just like nine

554
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,070
months so I break it down the first

555
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,800
three months I was waiting on anything

556
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,330
to actually get done and for the right

557
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,800
people to be informed so then that was

558
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:34,760
July time - by September 6 hacker one

559
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,100
got in touch with them disclosed a

560
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,990
report they have a system where they

561
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,440
send them an email and they'll let them

562
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,000
know about everything happening and

563
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,530
they'll have a link to click on and I

564
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,030
didn't know any of this stuff was going

565
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,700
on in the background

566
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,370
completely unaware because what actually

567
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,590
happened with my ticket was my ticket

568
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,020
got put into a category

569
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,960
where it's non-responsive vendors so I

570
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,270
was like literally sending loads of

571
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,010
messages loads of messages to Hakka Wan

572
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,980
to anyone like we would listen and it

573
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,360
was like screaming into the void

574
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,280
because no one was getting back to me

575
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,690
because when you're in that category

576
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,360
they don't get notifications which is

577
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,540
wrong

578
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,030
finally I bumped into one of the guys a

579
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,830
conference and I asked him about it and

580
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,150
he gave me his telephone number and I

581
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,160
spoke to him and he was really helpful

582
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,620
really helpful and then from there it

583
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,380
got changed and then it was back into

584
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,250
the right category again which then we

585
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,660
proceeded to look at the emails and the

586
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,580
communication between hacker 1 and who

587
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,030
is so who has sent an email that claimed

588
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,700
it was not an issue they literally wrote

589
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,250
an email where they detailed the problem

590
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,550
extensively and said oh it's not an

591
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:57,380
issue but what she happened was they got

592
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,480
told 6 September the 6th and then

593
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,340
between September the 7th and September

594
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,030
the 10th the code got changed anyway how

595
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,440
do I know this because of the wayback

596
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,680
machine it's a brilliant thing and then

597
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,080
I was trying to draw my process of

598
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,290
trying to find out what was going on and

599
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,520
I was getting no reply back from hacker

600
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,440
1 I was reaching out - who is - and

601
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,940
there was a complete communication shut

602
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,920
down they just would not talk to me they

603
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,230
said no go and speak to hack 1 we've

604
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,800
spoken to them and I've reached out as

605
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,140
well and told them about doing a talk

606
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:34,010
today and no response I mean as you can

607
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,140
see and it's very very light you can

608
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,640
read it

609
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,070
hello Cristina yes they reached out to

610
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,730
us regarding the supposed funder ability

611
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,080
sorry I've got of like a video of it

612
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,780
working quite well and and we have

613
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,040
responded to their email with the

614
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,530
explanation that it wasn't the case you

615
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,060
may reach out to hack 1 to obtain

616
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,890
information about our response to their

617
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,500
email the case is now being closed so

618
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,480
for that it got fixed and end of case

619
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,770
yeah but what could I have done in that

620
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,170
circumstance I could have found that and

621
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,030
I could just dropped it on Twitter then

622
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,470
every single hacker would have

623
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,330
gone out and scraped all the details of

624
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,590
any one that they could and I know there

625
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,789
are companies that have already got the

626
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:16,369
database details but I didn't because my

627
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:18,590
moral compass at that time was telling

628
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:32,600
me to do the right thing they comment so

629
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,739
basically it really is unacceptable and

630
00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:41,389
what I've done I'm pursuing it I know

631
00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:43,009
there's very little that hacker one can

632
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,690
do I know there's communication shutdown

633
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,789
with who is and I don't know if I'm

634
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:48,889
gonna get any for saying about it

635
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,210
but basically I did do all the right

636
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,549
things but what I did do is I wrote a

637
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:54,769
two-page report to hacker one to see

638
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,679
taylean all the timeline and any

639
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,210
questions I had about it and then room

640
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,070
for improvement because obviously I want

641
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,739
other researchers to do well if they

642
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:06,049
don't have anywhere to go the disclosure

643
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:07,639
assistance programs there to help them

644
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:09,139
and I want them to have the best

645
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:10,759
experience I don't want anyone been nine

646
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,559
months down the line and still like

647
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,049
having issues so yes so I've written a

648
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:19,419
report to hopefully that will help okay

649
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:30,799
the bad I guess Bell Microsoft Office

650
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:36,679
365 here's Gary

651
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:40,129
Gary's assist admin and he's adopted

652
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:42,950
office 365 to improve productivity in

653
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:46,070
the workplace in fact he's got half his

654
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,739
users now using mobile phones and

655
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:50,239
they're sharing documents and it's

656
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:50,869
really good

657
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:53,960
and here's Kevin Kevin's a happy hacker

658
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,059
he has cool stickers but very bad

659
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:58,669
intentions and he's been trying for

660
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:00,799
months to get into Gary's Network and to

661
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,840
get to his users but because Gary is a

662
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,279
really good admin he's got two-factor

663
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:08,029
authentication on his user accounts so I

664
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:14,179
can't get in yet so gonna give you a

665
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:16,690
crash course on Microsoft Office 365

666
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,529
subscriptions just in case you don't

667
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:21,289
know about them so we have different

668
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:25,639
types of accounts we have admin accounts

669
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:27,590
normally global admin accounts and then

670
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,029
they vary between like billion

671
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:30,980
administrator and these kind of things

672
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,960
but essentially you have the keys to the

673
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,809
kingdom if you have Wellings then you

674
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:38,710
have a subscribed user account

675
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:42,499
now these subscribed user accounts they

676
00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:45,610
normally come in with different packages

677
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,710
so I know it's not very good you can't

678
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,570
really see it that well but you have

679
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:54,259
either a monthly subscription base and

680
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:56,450
that's the way that office 365 is pretty

681
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,490
much moved towards or you can have like

682
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,889
a one-off for home users and it's

683
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:03,110
one-off fee but the difference is

684
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,269
between them is the stuff that you can

685
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:09,950
access so if we have a look here this

686
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:15,619
office 365 is the business one 7-pound

687
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:19,100
90 month and you get your outlook you

688
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,029
can get Excel Word onedrive but you

689
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:24,950
don't get SharePoint so what you'd need

690
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,539
to do you'd have to buy it as an extra

691
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:28,159
button which would cost like three pound

692
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,860
80 per month then you also have the

693
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,320
other packages up the way which also

694
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,710
include SharePoint these ones this one

695
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,730
here doesn't but the rest of them do so

696
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,220
these users can only access the products

697
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,659
that they're paying for and then

698
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:46,669
anything else that they want basically

699
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:47,840
they just have to upgrade their

700
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,149
subscription everyone understand that

701
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:53,059
cool right so we have the online

702
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:55,970
versions of Office Word Excel PowerPoint

703
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:59,269
SharePoint et cetera and Microsoft has a

704
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:02,509
really good business model in fact

705
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:04,580
they've got 155 million active users

706
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,039
with a growing growth of 3 million per

707
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,800
month that's a lot of money you know

708
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,149
even if you've got the very basic

709
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:17,719
account so to get a lot of raise our

710
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:21,369
hands right so say if you're a admin and

711
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:23,449
do you think you'll be able to access

712
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:25,429
everything all these different products

713
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:28,389
packages anyone do you think you would

714
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:32,449
yep yep how about a subscriber user

715
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:37,579
who's got a let's make it more precise

716
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:39,230
so safe we've got the SharePoint and

717
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,699
we've got the the business one that we

718
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,330
had there

719
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:46,159
shows as no sharepoint you think they

720
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,120
could get sharepoint if they wanted they

721
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:56,900
tried what happens here and is part of

722
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,920
the problem is that microsoft have made

723
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:08,660
it a free-for-all shock not only can the

724
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,610
admin account get into sharepoint

725
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,540
standard if you're a subscribed user you

726
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,360
can get into sharepoint standard if you

727
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,240
have a shared mailbox account you can

728
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,200
also access sharepoint if you have an

729
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,600
unlicensed account you can access

730
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,690
sharepoint and how do I know this

731
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:31,250
because I like around on my

732
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,380
computer just pretending to be user and

733
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,880
seen what I can get away with and that's

734
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,620
how I found it just going through a

735
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,360
normal process of just testing things

736
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,790
and seeing what works and what doesn't

737
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,650
it's not a groundbreaking discovery nor

738
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,140
is it a zero-day but is bad and it's

739
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:54,800
putting people at risk yep so that's

740
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,950
Gary and Kevin so what is the problem

741
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,010
here shared mailboxes can access

742
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,500
sharepoint and so can unlicensed so

743
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,210
Gary's a really good admin as we said

744
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,490
he's got two-factor authentication on

745
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:13,940
all of his user accounts but Gary

746
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,620
doesn't know you need to put two-factor

747
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,130
authentication on a shared mailbox user

748
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,510
because why would you generally speaking

749
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,240
they don't have passwords but what's

750
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,560
actually happened recently is that

751
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,110
Microsoft has allowed people to be able

752
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,900
to assign a password through a shared

753
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,940
mailbox and this is because they can

754
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,850
then get on their phone because when it

755
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,490
comes to mobile phone support with

756
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:39,440
Outlook Microsoft is a little bit

757
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,420
lacking on anything notes the shared

758
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,550
mailbox room so now that shared mailbox

759
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:49,370
has a password it doesn't have two

760
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,520
factor authentication

761
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,670
Kevin can now get into the accounts also

762
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,700
with an unlicensed exactly the same

763
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,330
situation now an unlicensed subscription

764
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,580
it would probably be someone who's left

765
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,980
the company and what they've done is

766
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,350
they've handed in their phone so there'd

767
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,210
be no two factor authentication really

768
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,240
if it's to be fair I don't think

769
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,920
everyone out there does put two-factor

770
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,360
authentication on them up Microsoft

771
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,880
Office 365 accounts I mean the average

772
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,120
score is something like 39 if you go by

773
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,480
the secure score on the tenants and that

774
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,460
can be improved by it by adding stuff

775
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,330
like that what's worse is with the share

776
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:35,390
bot the shared mailbox accounts the

777
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,390
monitoring is turned off by default

778
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:41,510
within the audit logs you have to

779
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,270
specifically do a PowerShell command for

780
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,950
it then - showing up how do I know this

781
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,450
because I found it and then I had to do

782
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,490
this because I was like where's all the

783
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,840
details of who's been logging in and

784
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,520
everything else with these accounts then

785
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:58,610
but small business user who just gets

786
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,460
office 365 to help them to be more

787
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,780
productive they're not going to

788
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,850
necessarily know about this stuff and

789
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,340
why because Microsoft do not document it

790
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,520
at all

791
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,020
now they know about where they've

792
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,520
actually got when I spoke to them

793
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,070
they've got a flag that should be turned

794
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,830
on for the tenant and basically what

795
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,840
happens is that restricts anyone getting

796
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,770
into SharePoint until so what can you do

797
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,870
when you get into SharePoint you can

798
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,030
view everything you can actually export

799
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:33,590
rate data you can then edit create and

800
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:37,430
remove groups he can then upgrade his

801
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,620
own account to add additional services

802
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,820
like flow or outlook and this causes a

803
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,340
problem because what he can then do he

804
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,830
can then send Gary a link or someone

805
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,690
else from another department and say hey

806
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:53,540
there's a new SharePoint site and then

807
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,100
they'll click onto that and then he

808
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,040
could be hosting all sorts of malicious

809
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,760
links everything that he wants and this

810
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,590
is the audit log and didn't show

811
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,280
anything

812
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,050
in fact it's not even turned on by

813
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,490
standards so you have to even go through

814
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,200
the house off that you can get

815
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,670
information gathering by having a look

816
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,410
at the search so you don't even need to

817
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,820
touch the sites themselves so you can go

818
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,440
through to the search part and if you go

819
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,090
into the classic search it's really

820
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,410
handy because it actually shows you a

821
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,930
visual representation of the site itself

822
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,940
so then all you need to do then is clone

823
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,390
that site you can clone that site and

824
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,430
then send a link to somebody else to

825
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,960
your own site where you're hosting the

826
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,000
malicious links and the admin would not

827
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,680
even know so here's an example of data

828
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,290
exfiltration so what I did is I got a

829
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:43,460
shared and unlicensed and I upgraded

830
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,920
this the subscription to add flow now

831
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,890
flow is a way of automation within

832
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:52,580
Microsoft and what I did is I I copied

833
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,500
every father was being uploaded from one

834
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,100
SharePoint site to another and this

835
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,750
other site the admin didn't have any

836
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,630
idea about can see it and the only way

837
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,490
that he could do it wasn't even showing

838
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,230
on his frequent sites because he'd never

839
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:11,180
been there and someone's gonna end up

840
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,690
getting hacked I mean it's not known

841
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:15,320
about

842
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,920
I mean Microsoft were really good about

843
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,310
this whole situation but and I'm a

844
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:25,070
Microsoft Research security team were

845
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,050
really good about this situation the

846
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,530
problem is I had is that they took the

847
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:35,480
report and said it was valid was going

848
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,860
to be added to the Microsoft Hall of

849
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,910
Fame and then he went slowly south the

850
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,530
SharePoint engineering team didn't agree

851
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:44,450
they said it was a licensing issue and

852
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:49,370
not a security issue I'm very sorry

853
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:52,010
I've tried fighting for this and he did

854
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:54,350
and my heart goes out to him because his

855
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,940
head's probably banging off a desk every

856
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,170
day if this is what's happening with

857
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,550
something I found I don't know what's

858
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:01,700
going on but I'm sure there's a reason

859
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,780
and that reason was with them we can't

860
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:11,150
read it from here it caused friction

861
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,730
with SharePoint adaption so basically

862
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:15,740
when they started releasing SharePoint

863
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,750
they had all these licenses but

864
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,610
none of the people will activating the

865
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,980
licenses so they just made it a

866
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,180
free-for-all sit all right then we'll

867
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,430
just turn it on for everyone and then if

868
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,900
they's at leas if they don't they don't

869
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:33,380
they allowed everyone basically into the

870
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,770
tenancy and see the SharePoint it's no

871
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,990
like I said but it's not documented and

872
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,900
the way that I can actually do it is by

873
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,440
just going on a link all I need to know

874
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,110
if I'm a hacker is this link here and

875
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:51,170
this is the main SharePoint page so I'm

876
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:56,990
on my admin account right now and I'm

877
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,600
now on a ship so I'm gonna shared cells

878
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,230
at victim account all I need to do is

879
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:07,820
put in the link and I've got access to

880
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,030
the all the sites there but there's

881
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,260
nothing much on there at the moment it's

882
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,900
just a development one I've not accessed

883
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,160
instincts I haven't gotten the frequent

884
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,320
sites but what I'd mean Gary is standing

885
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,510
is a really helpful guy he's put a list

886
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:23,390
of all the frequent sites for his team

887
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:27,500
members I can see all this so there's a

888
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,910
team group and that's private and the

889
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,380
settings are made as private and that's

890
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,860
brilliant it's a team group for an

891
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,870
organization now bearing in mind you go

892
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,580
and get a Microsoft Office 365

893
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,830
subscription and you pay for SharePoint

894
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,330
for anyone that you want in your

895
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,690
organization to see SharePoint anyone

896
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,130
else you would assume that they're not

897
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,120
going to be able to see any of this

898
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,980
stuff so you make it for the

899
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,520
organization but then the little hacker

900
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:58,450
man here he can go in god this Internet

901
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:03,530
and I tell you another thing that you

902
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,840
can do you can create a site and you can

903
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,320
create news posts do what you want you

904
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,990
can add news you can add links you can

905
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,210
get to the documents do everything that

906
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:19,220
you want it's pretty sure to prefer

907
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:24,319
I have not had a look at too much in

908
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,300
detail on this or staff is specifically

909
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:31,640
around this and if you want to work on

910
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:40,970
something every good yes so what can you

911
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,680
do about it so I've had a look at this

912
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,839
thing so I mean like I'm no expert but

913
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:46,369
this is the sort of stuff that I've

914
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:49,069
figured out so far you can review the

915
00:43:49,069 --> 00:43:50,630
SharePoint default configuration

916
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,210
settings you can review the logs and set

917
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,490
alerts specifically for your shared

918
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:58,280
mailboxes and your unlicensed users you

919
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,839
can restrict down a lock down where

920
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,490
possible now there are configuration

921
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:02,750
files in the back and the SharePoint

922
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:03,980
where you can do it you can also ask

923
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,960
Microsoft for that flag and I tell you

924
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,599
if you can and ask them about it maybe

925
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:09,710
something might actually be done about

926
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:13,190
this please delete all unused accounts

927
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,140
because they're just sat there waiting

928
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,859
to be used by someone else

929
00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:20,240
activate share but shared mailbox

930
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,609
monitoring and what will happen is it

931
00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:24,520
will actually show up in the audit log

932
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,440
so where I've been messing around there

933
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,910
let's see now this isn't turned on by

934
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:36,520
default let's see if it's shown anything

935
00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:44,810
nothing so so to complain to Microsoft

936
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,640
and update the documents because all the

937
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,930
documentation don't show it was working

938
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:54,500
right okay so I've literally not got

939
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,790
very much time and I've got more

940
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:59,060
exploits to show you that I found so

941
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,800
this was some secure application I can't

942
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,530
name for legal reasons reason being they

943
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:06,280
wanted me to sign in NDA

944
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,140
this was a blind XSS fire an embedded

945
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,119
widget on the victims site so the main

946
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,119
thing for me to point out here a

947
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,670
customer would embed the widget on their

948
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:21,530
site this would then provide a

949
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,150
communications channel say like a

950
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:25,609
comments box or a message ice box or

951
00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:27,740
thing this would then feed into a

952
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,420
platform that the admin of that site

953
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,460
would log in to what it was possible to

954
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,420
do is

955
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,330
just put a load of xs/s into there so as

956
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:37,460
soon as the admin opened up the admin

957
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,190
panel on the portal they would then see

958
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:45,740
this message and get attacked you get

959
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,160
hacked that's what happens okay I

960
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,960
remember the little Cloe from earlier on

961
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,460
slide sometimes feel like this because I

962
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,020
found this issue through due diligence I

963
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,090
do because of my company that I work

964
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,370
with I try and check any apps that we're

965
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,530
taking on board and I was like what

966
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:06,220
you're actually supposed to be a secure

967
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,120
application yeah I could do this and

968
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,420
then literally took five minutes today I

969
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:14,060
asked them when I put through the report

970
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,400
to them for a secure Channel and they

971
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,540
told me to send it through the same

972
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:21,500
means and it just fell off so they

973
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,180
didn't know about bug bounty programs at

974
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,170
all and as soon as I talked about maybe

975
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:30,170
a reward and I was more interested in

976
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,730
the library that they would use him

977
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,020
because it wasn't the reward I wanted to

978
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,190
get off them it was perhaps a third

979
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,660
party library that they were using in

980
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,820
which case it would be more valuable for

981
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:40,280
me to know however their devs were kind

982
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,100
of off and so were they so what I did is

983
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,110
I created my own NDA and I signed it and

984
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,420
I sent it and their detailed report with

985
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,530
videos were submitted now I've just eat

986
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:54,530
held my points of view on this no

987
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:57,970
systems are harmed I'll produce a report

988
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:01,340
and it's done with the mind of the

989
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,470
researchers protection and the rights

990
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:07,130
and the confidentiality I state that

991
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:09,440
I'll keep it confidential for 90 days

992
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,860
after fix and I was very willing to work

993
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,290
with them as much as possible for this

994
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:21,140
to be a positive thing I then got an

995
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:26,300
email back where they basically said yep

996
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,800
sure no problem they've signed it but

997
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,950
then there's CEO has actually detailed

998
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:32,600
here the nature of any such agreement

999
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,670
will be at the sole discretion of the

1000
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:36,860
platform as it deems appropriate to the

1001
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,630
impact of the finance on its key

1002
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:41,270
business objectives I found XSS in

1003
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:43,070
multiple places of their system and

1004
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:45,539
they're a secure site

1005
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:46,889
I would have thought that that would

1006
00:47:46,889 --> 00:47:48,329
have impacted their business models

1007
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:52,199
significantly so they patched it

1008
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:53,759
arranged a few pen tests and further

1009
00:47:53,759 --> 00:47:55,049
support is all done

1010
00:47:55,049 --> 00:47:58,589
they assist it is not severe basically

1011
00:47:58,589 --> 00:48:00,569
these developers that I kind of felt a

1012
00:48:00,569 --> 00:48:03,929
bit off about previously have ty Rena

1013
00:48:03,929 --> 00:48:06,179
said oh no no no no that was an issue at

1014
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:08,939
all it wasn't a problem and downplayed

1015
00:48:08,939 --> 00:48:11,249
it so even if you're speaking to a

1016
00:48:11,249 --> 00:48:13,049
company maybe the developers are working

1017
00:48:13,049 --> 00:48:16,799
with might have other ideas and what can

1018
00:48:16,799 --> 00:48:18,179
you do in that sort of situation

1019
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:21,419
the CEO asked for the extent of the

1020
00:48:21,419 --> 00:48:23,429
vulnerability so I did another rapport

1021
00:48:23,429 --> 00:48:27,509
and another video and I said to him look

1022
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:29,609
this is serious is this an exercice you

1023
00:48:29,609 --> 00:48:32,249
know I can do this showed them different

1024
00:48:32,249 --> 00:48:36,809
attacks and as part of this the

1025
00:48:36,809 --> 00:48:38,279
developers have actually said that they

1026
00:48:38,279 --> 00:48:39,689
had measures in the background that

1027
00:48:39,689 --> 00:48:44,929
would prevent this clearly not I did it

1028
00:48:44,929 --> 00:48:48,569
so this is going over a long period of

1029
00:48:48,569 --> 00:48:54,959
time then I got an offer a 75-pound this

1030
00:48:54,959 --> 00:48:58,219
is a company that's actually had

1031
00:48:58,219 --> 00:49:00,389
investment funding for the security of

1032
00:49:00,389 --> 00:49:02,399
the platform and I'm not money driven at

1033
00:49:02,399 --> 00:49:04,439
oh I can't care but what frustrated me

1034
00:49:04,439 --> 00:49:06,409
was the fact that the developers or the

1035
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:08,699
client because of the developers were

1036
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:11,099
perhaps saying something different would

1037
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:12,569
just not get in the severity of

1038
00:49:12,569 --> 00:49:16,079
everything what else they tried to do

1039
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,749
try to say yeah we'll give you 75 pounds

1040
00:49:18,749 --> 00:49:20,189
and you can have a free subscription for

1041
00:49:20,189 --> 00:49:22,499
three months on our program but we want

1042
00:49:22,499 --> 00:49:24,449
you to sign up to 12 months with our

1043
00:49:24,449 --> 00:49:29,489
system and also their NDA was indefinite

1044
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:31,619
meaning I could not talk about it ever

1045
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:34,649
which I felt was unfair I said 90 days

1046
00:49:34,649 --> 00:49:37,319
so basically they gave me 10 days to

1047
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:39,779
reply and I was too busy doing other

1048
00:49:39,779 --> 00:49:42,449
stuff so I didn't bother sometimes you

1049
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:45,209
just need to know it's worth drawing a

1050
00:49:45,209 --> 00:49:47,519
line and walking away because they're

1051
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:53,159
not going to listen good so the blue

1052
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:55,289
infall upload vulnerability I don't know

1053
00:49:55,289 --> 00:49:56,369
if any of you guys have heard about

1054
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:59,369
before basically it's one of the largest

1055
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:03,329
github repos out there with like 8,000

1056
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:06,539
Forks and 30,000 stars I didn't find it

1057
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:09,180
but my friend Larry did I reached out to

1058
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,890
Larry said I was really interested in

1059
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:12,720
this could I have a look at things and

1060
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,279
he was brilliant I spent a whole weekend

1061
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,869
working with him writing one of my first

1062
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:21,509
official reports and it felt brilliant

1063
00:50:21,509 --> 00:50:23,039
having that kind of support and I think

1064
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:24,480
that's one of the things as security

1065
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,009
researchers you grow that little

1066
00:50:26,009 --> 00:50:27,450
community around you to help you and it

1067
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:34,170
helps massively so the problem with this

1068
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,210
was you had the ability to upload any

1069
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,579
file type due to lack of checks you have

1070
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:40,170
the ability to upload to the service

1071
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,420
route due to miss configuration issue

1072
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,999
you also had a problem where the

1073
00:50:44,999 --> 00:50:47,039
developer had put in security mechanisms

1074
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:48,839
but because a patch he'd updated its own

1075
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:51,150
configuration files it then superseded

1076
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,740
the protections that the developer put

1077
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,420
in place so that was another area of

1078
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,490
problems so the good things a bit I

1079
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:02,789
found that a platform had in being using

1080
00:51:02,789 --> 00:51:05,880
the file upload library and then they

1081
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,950
were then passing distributing their own

1082
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:10,950
platform it's quite popular so they

1083
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:13,950
actually responded to things and managed

1084
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:16,019
to get it resolved within 48 hours

1085
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:17,970
it was patched within their own platform

1086
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:20,309
it was brilliant and they were really

1087
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:22,170
good about it also the developer of

1088
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:25,200
Bloom was really good he's actually

1089
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,109
written some security documentation how

1090
00:51:28,109 --> 00:51:31,019
to configure everything properly and

1091
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:33,559
that was a really positive experience

1092
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:36,569
the report that I wrote Larry then

1093
00:51:36,569 --> 00:51:38,400
distributed to the Akamai's security

1094
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,920
research research team and his managers

1095
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,380
and then he also gave me a shout-out on

1096
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:48,450
the echo my blog and let me just go back

1097
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:50,730
to that one and I guess from this one

1098
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:55,109
here the point is when I did this I

1099
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:58,200
looked into it and I wanted to send out

1100
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,869
vulnerability reports to other people

1101
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:02,039
who might be using this because there

1102
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:03,569
are 20,000 other sites that could

1103
00:52:03,569 --> 00:52:06,239
possibly be affected by this and even

1104
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:07,680
though when I did it no one got back to

1105
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,099
me I still feel that it was a good end

1106
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:12,660
to something I was working on because of

1107
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,140
the support

1108
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,510
because worked with different people

1109
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:19,319
including CD nsj so they host all the

1110
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:22,109
JavaScript right to make it quicker for

1111
00:52:22,109 --> 00:52:24,900
web developers and what we wanted to do

1112
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,700
we wanted to cut the head of the snake

1113
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,359
and possibly use a redirection technique

1114
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:32,490
where anyone who was using the old

1115
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:35,910
versions of the blue imp library would

1116
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:38,670
then be forwarded to the new and we had

1117
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:39,960
the discussion now obviously with that

1118
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,849
you could actually probably brick sites

1119
00:52:41,849 --> 00:52:43,799
so we didn't go ahead with it but was

1120
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:45,420
still very positive discussion and

1121
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,859
something where researchers should look

1122
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:50,880
into in the future so a nun named C

1123
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,589
called for paper platform this is

1124
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:54,650
something that's going on at the moment

1125
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,539
it allowed for other people to see data

1126
00:52:57,539 --> 00:53:00,000
about another person by entering their

1127
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,390
email address so that was the

1128
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:04,319
information disclosure

1129
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,859
you also had XSS and you could attack

1130
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:11,130
anyone because of the way that the data

1131
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:14,309
was being passed through the system you

1132
00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:15,690
could actually attack the reviewing

1133
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,759
committee now bearing in mind some of

1134
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:19,109
these people who are on the reviewing

1135
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:20,759
committees for call for papers are very

1136
00:53:20,759 --> 00:53:25,049
important people these are people within

1137
00:53:25,049 --> 00:53:27,869
our own industry this was a platform

1138
00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:29,640
within information security

1139
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,529
so why was it happened in people didn't

1140
00:53:34,529 --> 00:53:37,079
know the the developers and the platform

1141
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:39,269
had a feature enabled and they didn't

1142
00:53:39,269 --> 00:53:40,769
know about it but as soon as they did

1143
00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:44,369
they turned it off they said it was a

1144
00:53:44,369 --> 00:53:48,180
feature not a bug and I can't go into

1145
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,099
too much details because it's still

1146
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:53,009
being waiting to be cleared by legal but

1147
00:53:53,009 --> 00:53:54,900
they were fantastic they acted on

1148
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,950
reports immediately

1149
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:57,869
I was up till four o'clock in the

1150
00:53:57,869 --> 00:53:59,279
morning right in the report and then the

1151
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:01,380
next morning send it through and over

1152
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,700
the weekend period they'd fixed

1153
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,950
everything which was fantastic and there

1154
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,079
was communication there's communication

1155
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:08,579
backwards and forwards between me and

1156
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,130
them and I think that speaks for itself

1157
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:12,059
when you have that level of

1158
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:13,619
communication it really does help I

1159
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:16,140
didn't go on to Twitter and drop this

1160
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,240
and be like oh there's all this bad

1161
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,859
stuff going on in information security

1162
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:21,509
and look look what they're doing you

1163
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:23,190
know that what they're supposed to be

1164
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,839
the security professionals I didn't do

1165
00:54:24,839 --> 00:54:25,840
that I

1166
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:30,460
of work through and it's because you

1167
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:31,840
have to make the right choice when doing

1168
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,050
this but I think also during the process

1169
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:38,890
what happens impacts on what you do so

1170
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:41,050
really grateful and we're going through

1171
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:44,140
a range in a rewards but to be fair I'm

1172
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,610
not too fussed about that it's just the

1173
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:47,440
fact that my fellow information security

1174
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,290
peers are going to be ok that unhappy

1175
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:56,650
and I literally I felt like that so

1176
00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:00,540
awesome people shout out to my mans if

1177
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:04,900
none of this what I've done ever ever

1178
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:18,940
see name-dropper and so yeah it's been

1179
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,590
my first year and I hope that you might

1180
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,000
have learned a bit from some of the

1181
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,980
things I've discovered and I didn't know

1182
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,430
what I was doing and hopefully that

1183
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:28,720
during this talk I might made some

1184
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,190
points about things that you can take

1185
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:34,270
away with you but one of the people that

1186
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:35,830
I did reach out to was there for fish

1187
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:38,790
and he gave me a bug bounty template

1188
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:43,000
that I use now even still and it really

1189
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,620
helped me because it put everything that

1190
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,060
I needed to put down and give to a

1191
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,190
vendor in a really nice way so have a

1192
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:51,220
look at is github also some shout outs

1193
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,440
to some other amazing people like you

1194
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,030
need support from the community when you

1195
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:56,560
go through this even if it's just like

1196
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,110
you need an agony on other end of a

1197
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:03,610
voice call so the mini-hats Club they

1198
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,380
have a really good research community

1199
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:08,230
and they're fantastic and when you're

1200
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:09,400
pulling your hair out you can speak to

1201
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,870
other researchers about it and it really

1202
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:14,260
does help you have cybersex - he's been

1203
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,930
a great person to speak to also ghostie

1204
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:18,610
who who looked at some of the stuff that

1205
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:20,740
I've done with regards to this

1206
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,320
presentation and reviewed parts of it

1207
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,990
obviously Zef he's also got a book by

1208
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:28,990
the way if you didn't know by the book

1209
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:34,480
and Rico so on Tony I'm trying to give

1210
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,990
back a little myself what I've done is

1211
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:39,410
I've provided a template

1212
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,690
the blue file upload report which how

1213
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,900
she does go down into detail and I was

1214
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,119
running out of time so I've had to bash

1215
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,280
straight through it but what you can do

1216
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,039
you can go onto my website you can go to

1217
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:55,190
the Google link there get the report and

1218
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:57,619
you can start sending these run ability

1219
00:56:57,619 --> 00:56:59,480
reports out through other websites are

1220
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,309
out there there's a lot of companies

1221
00:57:01,309 --> 00:57:02,930
smaller companies especially that I've

1222
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:04,549
run a brawl and they need our help to do

1223
00:57:04,549 --> 00:57:06,650
it so I've given you all the tools that

1224
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:09,349
you need to get started all I ask you

1225
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:12,349
let us know how you get on and I think

1226
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:13,549
we can actually probably make a little

1227
00:57:13,549 --> 00:57:15,230
difference doing that so if you're new

1228
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:16,220
to all this and you want to get started

1229
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,720
have a look at that because everything's

1230
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,780
there for you

1231
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:23,240
further help so know your rights know

1232
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,250
your Terms of Service when you're

1233
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:28,670
working on a product software understand

1234
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:31,609
the iso's know the laws in which you

1235
00:57:31,609 --> 00:57:33,559
need to abide by and have a look at the

1236
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:36,440
end-user license agreements get a decent

1237
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,180
template together I have one now

1238
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,640
thankfully and work on explaining

1239
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,829
frequent problems with diagrams and

1240
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:45,500
videos to help then you won't get the

1241
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,359
to-and-fro we don't understand the

1242
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:49,789
problem so can you expand so what I

1243
00:57:49,789 --> 00:57:53,029
found was analogies and examples really

1244
00:57:53,029 --> 00:57:56,869
do work I also and have a AWS server

1245
00:57:56,869 --> 00:57:59,059
that I've set up to demonstrate proof of

1246
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:01,809
concept and what I've done with my XSS

1247
00:58:01,809 --> 00:58:04,849
reports is I've done a redirection

1248
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:07,160
attack and then that redirection attack

1249
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,230
then leads to a page where you have a

1250
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:11,450
key logger that's embedded into the site

1251
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:13,700
so it's a very nice visual

1252
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,920
representation for that person they see

1253
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,809
somebody else's credentials being stolen

1254
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:19,789
because you've cloned their site they're

1255
00:58:19,789 --> 00:58:21,589
put in the details in and they can see

1256
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:27,289
that it's actually been stolen life form

1257
00:58:27,289 --> 00:58:29,720
friendships and get the researcher

1258
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,609
community behind you and seek advice

1259
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:32,900
because you never know when you might

1260
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:36,260
need it take a break and get clear heads

1261
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,869
whenever you can and mainly don't be a

1262
00:58:38,869 --> 00:58:44,029
dick as well and buboes actually got a

1263
00:58:44,029 --> 00:58:46,099
little Santa's list and what he does now

1264
00:58:46,099 --> 00:58:49,190
Uber's one of my friends and he's

1265
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:51,020
actually got this list he's the guy who

1266
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,910
had the problem with a tree and he's the

1267
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:55,960
who got hit now he's now got a website

1268
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,790
and he's got a Santa's naughty list

1269
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:01,370
oh nice list and he lists down all the

1270
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,170
people that's working with and what the

1271
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:05,210
status is with those people and if

1272
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,310
they've been idiots or not so that you

1273
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:08,720
know I'm not saying you should do it but

1274
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,980
yeah that's it so final thoughts we do

1275
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:16,190
not live in an ideal world go and have a

1276
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:18,110
look at the guide really nice clothes in

1277
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:21,830
part that he's got with conclusion and I

1278
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,210
don't think we even got time for

1279
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:28,210
questions that way no no thank you
