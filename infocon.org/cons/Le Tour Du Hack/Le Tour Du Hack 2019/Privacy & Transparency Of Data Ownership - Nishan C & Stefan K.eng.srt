1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,330
why have one and I am ashamed over Chen

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,970
can we talk about them you called it

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,550
proceed apparently they to ownership or

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,190
what we find is we kind of kind of

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,420
probably moved closer to back to usage

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,100
use of that data oxy oceans not that

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,719
long and also what we thought is having

8
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:36,289
talks here today - seems to be quite

9
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:39,199
technical both kind of change of pace

10
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:45,789
then the more overdue said types like

11
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:50,420
score beach water situation yeah explore

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:59,079
some of the so who are we

13
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,460
yeah so doctors if I'm recently done a

14
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,590
and Emma since I'm scusi but my

15
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,850
background in intelligence all right

16
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:21,940
guys how about let's say quite a while

17
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,250
after my MSC time think I'm doing the

18
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,010
soft warfare and Trump status due to

19
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,010
that nicely

20
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:40,210
fugly lot more research pops loose it is

21
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:45,909
how follow the law society loses their

22
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:53,210
social in life outside society and of

23
00:01:53,210 --> 00:02:02,330
course man - I - thanks edition so yeah

24
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,909
I'm Stefan so actually I'm all kind of

25
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:06,650
industry so you know over the last

26
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,780
number of years I've worked

27
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,049
calcio worked in software but finance

28
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,830
systems and more recently can

29
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,050
I'm working a lot with the spread of

30
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,050
publishing associations want to get that

31
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,790
message their content out that global

32
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,340
audience and yeah we're a technology

33
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,040
partner we partner with those sample

34
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,800
relations global poses so also ghupat

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,770
work through the UK EBI so dissolved

36
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,690
from identification so just more on a

37
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,700
process of post more so kind of like

38
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,769
methodology but on incidence after

39
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,890
hospitality so similar to mission and

40
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,709
you know master cybersecurity I found

41
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:55,600
that for me that was just a great thing

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,760
to do she sewed up a lot my industrial

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,350
kind of experience sectors and subsidies

44
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,670
at work that covers many different

45
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,280
things and for me just was was a great

46
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,660
leader to even at this point in my life

47
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,640
let's say so you know education is the

48
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,270
number two tools to start that game so

49
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,190
you know most a few things you know

50
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,200
articles and journals this book come out

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,500
as well jaymund you know clear the

52
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,700
trials and transparency of that data

53
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,640
similar fell over RSA and MIT so yeah

54
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,160
which is here really just to kind of

55
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,590
just give that allude to the beginning

56
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,260
that idea about cross everywhere really

57
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,050
promising transparency of pay your

58
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,400
ownership survive having pregnant is

59
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:48,370
shown the weekend you can dump we're

60
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,120
going to talk about going to my data it

61
00:03:51,120 --> 00:04:09,880
rips eBay but they understand pain kind

62
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,400
of read the whole PowerPoint and talk

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:24,940
about packs a while way to go that's the

64
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,360
sort of

65
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,870
[Music]

66
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,770
I'm looking at the breakdown their usual

67
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:43,270
suspect services just media some of the

68
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,990
elders really what's interesting about a

69
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,880
lot of these agencies how is it going to

70
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:58,270
be used what maybe explore today just to

71
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,040
kind of think about how data is being

72
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,730
used as opposed so we can't talk about

73
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,890
data and how it's being used without

74
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,390
pushing upon the industry 4.0 as well

75
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,850
again some more I'm sure you're all

76
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,030
familiar with we talked about well if

77
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,800
you think about industry three or the

78
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,080
third revolution of industry digital

79
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,570
revolution I guess for point no is more

80
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,400
geared around automation and integration

81
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,040
of automation around processes

82
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,780
everything from the set of things sub

83
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,220
physical systems robotics nanotech

84
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,490
quantum computing how how everything is

85
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,420
effectively gonna change or we're seeing

86
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,910
already a lot of this stuff is happening

87
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,160
now a lot of it is due to come like 5g

88
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,180
autonomous vehicles it's a really

89
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,730
society and I guess the way we do things

90
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,160
is changing our usage of data

91
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,500
I suppose data is perhaps changing the

92
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,510
way society operates as opposed to

93
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,570
society changing the way we generate

94
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,280
data so moving on from industry 4.0 we

95
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,330
then look at what is data ownership

96
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,180
so again data ownership a bit obvious

97
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,460
really but if you look at it

98
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,190
legislatively I suppose if you're the

99
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,560
owner of data you're gonna have more

100
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,210
ideally you want to have complete

101
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,890
control and legal rights over the back

102
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,050
piece of specific piece of data and

103
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,570
that's what it comes to cyllage

104
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,610
legislatively I should say that also

105
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,160
means that you can create you know edit

106
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,570
modify restrict that access or that

107
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,160
particular data so you give permissions

108
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,980
to whichever organization it is that

109
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,340
you're given that data to at the same

110
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,790
time they're just listed lis

111
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,920
usually you you know you can surrender

112
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,660
these rights or share these rights with

113
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,610
terms and conditions or you know use

114
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,600
accept you know you accept the

115
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,580
permissions to use a particular platform

116
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,920
you usually give them rights to use your

117
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,860
data again there's something all aware

118
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,050
of and again so I didn't trying to

119
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,090
identify data Rona's again that's in it

120
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,980
that's a big kind of thing right now

121
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,450
because with this big mishmash of

122
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,070
sharing rights giving permissions who

123
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,240
actually owns data that's being

124
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,690
generated is easy to say well I am doing

125
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,340
X Y Zed function therefore the data

126
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,620
that's generated off of that is mine but

127
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,990
is it actually mine and if it goes for

128
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,760
platform does the platform own it or do

129
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,650
they just use it and if they share it

130
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,440
you know what where where is the

131
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,790
permission coming from and is there an

132
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,770
implied permission to that land it

133
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,260
becomes like quite a quite complicated

134
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,270
legislative kind of conundrum really

135
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,340
talking about well I monopolies one of

136
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,060
the things that's all well with

137
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,220
monopolies I've put not the game there

138
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,650
meaning if we took if we taught my dated

139
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,500
data generation data ownership and if I

140
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,250
use an example of Google and you know

141
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,770
whether it's your gmail account or your

142
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,210
Google search history or whatever it

143
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,280
might be and if you think of alphabet

144
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,740
Inc that own Google but then all of the

145
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,180
other kind of subsidiaries under

146
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,730
alphabet Inc so straight away if

147
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,180
alphabet Inc have quite a few I guess

148
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,100
different facets or different kind of

149
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,450
tunnels that you're generating data and

150
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,990
giving data to will say about this as an

151
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,280
organization that become very powerful

152
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,230
cuz suddenly they've got a lot of data

153
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,840
that they can be doing or some of the

154
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,530
things that were going to be talking

155
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,710
about shortly so yeah monopolies really

156
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,080
data is becoming the the gold might or

157
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,000
not the goldmine but the kind of the

158
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,210
currency the new oil I guess of the of

159
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,059
the cyber world I had a video here to

160
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,340
show you about a project anything's

161
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,380
gonna over we'll see

162
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,400
sidewalk labs I'm not sure if anyone's

163
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,380
aware of the work that Sidewalk labs are

164
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,680
doing in Toronto I'm seeing lots of

165
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,540
blank faces so I'm assuming not sidewalk

166
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,370
labs right there essentially they're a

167
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,390
startup that were bought by alphabet Inc

168
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,600
Google their idea was to create or they

169
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,220
are creating a neighborhood within

170
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,810
Toronto that's going to be effectively a

171
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,870
smart neighborhood monitoring everything

172
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:10,290
facial recognition using web basically

173
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,700
with five gene all the other networks

174
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,400
and things using biometric tracking

175
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,870
behavior analytics all sorts of stuff so

176
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,010
when you're in this neighborhood their

177
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,110
idea is that by tracking you and your

178
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,550
data that you're generating everything

179
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,930
that you're doing they can provide a

180
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,060
better service and provide targeted

181
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,190
infrastructure and whatnot obviously

182
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,620
there's a massive privacy kind of

183
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,540
connotation to that and perhaps even an

184
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,070
ethical an ethical kind of thing that

185
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,580
will that we can talk about I had but I

186
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,310
had a video that was the you know one of

187
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:43,860
these glossy promotional video we're

188
00:09:43,860 --> 00:10:39,420
doing see if a place I put on speak

189
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,719
around

190
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:55,610
this or is this like this but yeah yeah

191
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,629
like they I mean essentially if you look

192
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:58,939
up sidewalk labs it's quite interesting

193
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:01,779
they're using these you know free Wi-Fi

194
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:04,610
you know for everyone you know by all

195
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,199
means free Wi-Fi do what you want on the

196
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,540
Wi-Fi and whilst we kind of mine your

197
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,730
data obviously they're looking at it

198
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,410
from a very kind of utopian point of

199
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,350
view I look at things from a data

200
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,189
profiling

201
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:19,790
I guess side I guess as security experts

202
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,990
we kind of have to be quite critical

203
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,399
quite skeptical about these sorts of

204
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,160
things I'll skip along if there's no

205
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,750
sound again it's it's not

206
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,550
mission-critical it was just it's just

207
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,500
an interesting concept as to what's

208
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,379
what's going on and on the advert that's

209
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:34,819
what I guess on the other side of the

210
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,360
spectrum to sidewalk labs in Toronto

211
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,800
obviously there's the work that's going

212
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,389
on in Shenzhen at the minute in China

213
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:43,910
with them facial recognition and

214
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,790
automatic essentially in Shenzhen I'm

215
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,110
not sure if anyone's been to Shenzhen in

216
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,360
China and you guys know the offense of

217
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,709
jaywalking don't you if you cross the

218
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,620
road on a red man say if you've got you

219
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,059
got two pedestrian crossing red man

220
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:57,680
green man so you cross the road or you

221
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,120
wait until the traffic light changes if

222
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,279
it's red and you cross the road facial

223
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,439
recognition identifies you you know to

224
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:04,939
cross the road they get your details

225
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:06,470
from WeChat and they automatically

226
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,139
billed you and find you and you get your

227
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:10,309
criminal record everything in it notify

228
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:12,050
via your phone but by the time you've

229
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,309
crossed the road it's all about and so

230
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,050
that's trying to but like I said it's

231
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:22,519
it's you know it's kind of the dark side

232
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,050
of looking at that kind of data

233
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,480
inflection so yes I mean it's definite

234
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,769
to it I probably missed it on the first

235
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:29,569
slide but when we're talking about data

236
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:32,720
again data collection points so I'm

237
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,309
trying to keep I keep throwing out

238
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:37,040
talking about the data that we're

239
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,509
generating but when we think about data

240
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,769
collection points and talking about

241
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:48,350
talking about s attendees throwing me

242
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,480
off place collection place we talk about

243
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,680
what were you know things that your

244
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,829
phone generates so location history your

245
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:57,380
search history you know IOT devices

246
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,699
listening devices

247
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:00,170
that kind of thing right so these are

248
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,340
the sorts of

249
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,230
I mean your I can stand here and give

250
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,100
you a one-hour lecture on data

251
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,240
collection points it's gonna be really

252
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,180
boring so I'm not going to do it big big

253
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,840
data again yes I mean big data now I

254
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,480
mean it's it's metadata right it's it's

255
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,070
all sorts of things that we are

256
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,570
generating in terms of our listening

257
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,980
habits our driving habits our

258
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,750
consumption habits what we buy food

259
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,490
where we buy food what times we buy food

260
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,410
what time we leave the house what time

261
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,240
we go to work who's in our household

262
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,600
you know medical conditions medical data

263
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,510
everything you can think of biometrics

264
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,980
how we do things has some interesting

265
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,620
research on biometrics one particular

266
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,330
one that I was looking at recently was

267
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,390
them by tracking on your computer so if

268
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,680
you're sitting in an office space and

269
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,770
you're doing your work and you've got

270
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,060
your Word document up and you don't want

271
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,870
your boss to see what you're doing

272
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,830
because you're actually playing

273
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,230
something else using the camera they can

274
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,700
monitor your eye tracking movements

275
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,870
actually correlate that with what's on

276
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,160
your screen so are you actually reading

277
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,540
the document that's on your screen or

278
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,150
are you doing something else I mean

279
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,650
that's just a very very kind of

280
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,490
breezeway throughout or looking at I

281
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,360
guess if you're if your manager leaves

282
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,980
the office and suddenly everyone's

283
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,660
walking to a particular area all you're

284
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,950
going to see a particular person

285
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,540
somewhere else in the office that you

286
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,089
might not necessarily be dealing with in

287
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,190
your everyday kind of operations why are

288
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,660
you going to see that person I mean you

289
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,800
can look at it from an insider threat

290
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,270
kind of point of view so you know

291
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,070
behavioral analytics again but again

292
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,480
it's a sort of tracking units and sort

293
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,000
of stuff that now is being looked at

294
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,290
it's the data state that's already been

295
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,760
collected but now it's they're finding

296
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,110
uses for it really social data or social

297
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,930
media data misuse you know rhetoric

298
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,100
Cambridge analytic and stuff which

299
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,800
Stefan will talk about later and again

300
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,130
then we go on about key key logging

301
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,870
third part third-party keyboards is an

302
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,580
interesting one I mean anyone who's got

303
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,640
a Google phone like a pixel and you've

304
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,770
got your what they call the G board if

305
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,209
you go into a Google account you can

306
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:57,860
actually look up all of the words that

307
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,940
you've added in your dictionary in lock

308
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,010
words you've actually typed within G

309
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,900
board so it's quite worrying really that

310
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,550
to think that actually everything you

311
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,160
ever type is being stored somewhere just

312
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,930
food for thought see ya which leads onto

313
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,089
what do you devices know about you so

314
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:14,930
yeah

315
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,070
a place you've ever visited a thing

316
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,440
you've ever told someone obviously we've

317
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,440
got Siri goggle that kind of thing

318
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,700
ought to be a standard kind of things

319
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,230
that you think of but when you really

320
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,120
kind of start deep-diving and thinking

321
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,200
about what do I actually have on my

322
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,089
phone whether it's my credit card

323
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:32,029
information or you know my emails my

324
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,250
text messages my whatsapp's my usage

325
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,110
very much traffic data when I'm going

326
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,390
you know what when I'm traveling here

327
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,339
from where I live and I'm looking on my

328
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,560
Google Maps or I'm using my Virgin

329
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,300
Trains information or once I get here

330
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,130
and I use my uber to get to the hotel or

331
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,500
trying to walk here and whatever right

332
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,390
to do so all sorts of kind of profiling

333
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,190
data building that white up data kind of

334
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,209
picture about someone so when we move on

335
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:58,010
from that we kind of enter the realm of

336
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,610
data profiling which is kind of where

337
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,270
I'm or one of my hats I suppose where

338
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,339
again so you start thinking about data

339
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:09,589
points and metadata this is the stuff

340
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:12,140
that we're kind of generating and as a

341
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,020
data profiler if I want to profile a

342
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,459
particular individual I want to know

343
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:18,290
what makes them think what are they

344
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,880
doing obviously I know I you know it

345
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,350
depends on why I'm profiling the buyer

346
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,670
need to know what they think what

347
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,080
they're doing what what their likes and

348
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,430
dislikes oh I can kind of get a

349
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,080
psychrometric profile from them to

350
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,120
analyze them for particular reasonable

351
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,360
way so now you have a treasure trove of

352
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,980
things we've got social media activity

353
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,620
yeah your likes and your shares on

354
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,750
Facebook straight or or any social media

355
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,040
I know straight away what sort of things

356
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,180
you like what sort of things you don't

357
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,330
like I mean that could be political it

358
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,430
could be just general kind of events it

359
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,950
could be your favorite movies or your

360
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,270
favorite music or whatever it might be

361
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,650
your status updates what are you

362
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,870
thinking about what are you doing your

363
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,480
check-ins where are you I mean Strava I

364
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,400
mean you everyone knows Strava the

365
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,079
fitness app right and then knew about

366
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,540
that issue last year about the actual

367
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,150
mapping of military bases through Fitbit

368
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,780
so don't need to go into that again

369
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,550
internet search history that's a scary

370
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,949
one

371
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:14,329
well I won't go too much in tax peanut

372
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,309
are self-explanatory YouTube twitch

373
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:18,020
again what videos you watch who you

374
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,599
watch you know what what is it about

375
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,250
those particular videos that you you

376
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,530
like to watch pornhub search history I

377
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,550
don't know what pornhub is May

378
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,140
be someone like explained to Alda to

379
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,450
have no knowledge of quanta whatsoever

380
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,630
but I hear that you know based on

381
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,610
people's pornhub history I mean can you

382
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,250
imagine looking at pornography without

383
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,170
going too much into detail it's a very

384
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,400
private thing why'd you do it at home

385
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,500
behind closed doors can you imagine what

386
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,850
someone can do with the information if

387
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,370
they knew your pornographic likes or

388
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,990
dislikes in terms of thinking of um a

389
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,810
psychrometric point of view right very

390
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,100
very scary when you think read it that

391
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,630
way and then couple that with your

392
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,610
Amazon search history you're gaming like

393
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,840
something I'll say so we're not just

394
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,620
talking about whether someone is you

395
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,270
know your basic kind of psychometric

396
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,770
stuff now we're really kind of getting

397
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,090
those really valuable deep dark kind of

398
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,350
indicators those data metrics about an

399
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,020
individual that become really depending

400
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,100
again on which way you look at it

401
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,480
whether you really want to investigate

402
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,610
them heavily or socially engineer them

403
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,260
for a particular reason I mean obviously

404
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,250
if you're looking it from a law

405
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,870
enforcement or an intelligence point of

406
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,820
view if you want to get an individual

407
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,990
more information on that individual pop

408
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,760
G I mean I put pub G up there

409
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,930
everyone knows play on the ground

410
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,550
battlegrounds right you know they're

411
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,100
like the cod online but the Battle

412
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,560
Royale type thing

413
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,820
that's an interesting platform actually

414
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,650
it's a it's an intelligence Trevor

415
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,990
treasure trove I'll just put it that way

416
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,110
in terms of people's conversations

417
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,160
within those servers and stuff I might

418
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,870
go into the sorts of stuff that goes on

419
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,190
in there and the sorts of things that

420
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,620
discussion that I discussed on there but

421
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,550
we're talking about dark web

422
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,580
transactions terrorism cancer yeah that

423
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,200
kind of stuff is quite it's quite scary

424
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,880
what people are saying on there and what

425
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,350
you know and who's listening

426
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,610
same with fortnight you'll be surprised

427
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,990
that the sorts of people that go on for

428
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,460
my on what they talk about that's what

429
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,490
I'm gonna say about that one free use

430
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,910
platforms I think one of the other talks

431
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,320
mentioned this before are they actually

432
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,210
free well oh yeah I mean therefore

433
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,950
they're free but you know you're you're

434
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,810
free because you're giving them your

435
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,030
data otherwise what's the point so from

436
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,400
there you would spoken about all these

437
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,360
data sets and their sources so building

438
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,430
psychometric profiles and I put Spotify

439
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,010
me there well Spotify got me is then

440
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,280
unaware of Spotify dot me probably not

441
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,010
of one good

442
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,050
of course is for you but yeah

443
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,620
so if I put that up so we all know what

444
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,430
Spotify is right yeah I'm a heavy user

445
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,550
of Spotify and I can't leave this

446
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,900
invisible wall here because of the

447
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,780
camera but then I've got on these

448
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,230
magical pen secondly so this was as of

449
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,360
January so again your daily mix is a bit

450
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,740
obvious you think yeah I listen to music

451
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,260
and what if I learns the source of music

452
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,730
that I like and I listen to and it

453
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,260
builds a profile and it kind of says oh

454
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,240
you know your daily mix one two three

455
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,040
four depending on your mood so lots of

456
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,570
things there from Dean Martin and Bing

457
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,760
Crosby all the way to some movie

458
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,970
soundtracks to Max Richter and you know

459
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,040
kind of showing different facets of my

460
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,800
personality right as to what I like what

461
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,210
I dislike and yeah that's helpful for me

462
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,890
because I want to just click on a daily

463
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,150
mix that I know I'm going to listen to

464
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,630
that kind of music and fantastic great

465
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,680
so why don't we do a bit of a deeper

466
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,430
dive though so I've got Spotify which is

467
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,160
your music streaming service which is

468
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,910
free yes it is free but you get ads or

469
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,620
you pay for your premium service and

470
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,950
then there's Spotify for brands which is

471
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,390
essentially what spots

472
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,430
what Spotify are doing with that data

473
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,410
that they're collecting you know sending

474
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,090
it to brands effectively I won't say

475
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,010
what brands and I won't say who is

476
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,680
buying that data but it's not just

477
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,910
advertisers I'll put it that way so if

478
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,950
you go on Spotify dot me it's actually

479
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,160
essentially like a I guess a I say

480
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,650
public but a user kind of front so that

481
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,630
you can potentially access or you can

482
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,120
access your more limited amounts of your

483
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,130
Spotify profile to actually see what

484
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,260
sort of data and psychometric profile

485
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,120
that they've actually gained off of you

486
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,030
or gain from your listening habits so I

487
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,010
kind of did that to myself you just have

488
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,650
a look so it came up with based on the

489
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,940
music that I like is really hard to read

490
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,080
so I'll have a look curious the stage

491
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,120
he'll according to your streams it looks

492
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,740
like you're into coffee house rather

493
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,020
than house all you need is a guitar mic

494
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,480
and maybe a latte so I'm assured

495
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,680
individual based on my music I mean I

496
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,390
know I like to think I've come across is

497
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,890
a chilled individual maybe it's not

498
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,080
coming across right now but then looking

499
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,420
again it says keeping at 100 here so

500
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,030
damn you like a lot of any

501
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,800
based on your listening we guess you

502
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,150
lose music through soundtrack your

503
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,560
workout and party moments so to two

504
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,000
slightly different sides of me there but

505
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,010
I would say to be honest that's that's

506
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,570
quite accurate because I like to live as

507
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,580
you saw from the daily mixer I listen to

508
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,110
lots of music depending on my mood and

509
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,700
being one that this is just a very very

510
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,380
scratching the surface of the sorts of

511
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,690
things that they're getting and then we

512
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,780
go on to the time of day that I listen

513
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,390
to music straightaway you think oh okay

514
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,400
I listen to music more at 7 p.m. and

515
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,190
maybe midday but there you've got a

516
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,810
little spike between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m.

517
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:33,410
and this was taken January 28th well

518
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,510
this was clay turd on January 28th so I

519
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,520
can probably tell you now that around

520
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,900
that time I was doing some work in the

521
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,830
middle of the light and I was polishing

522
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,210
work in the middle of the night and

523
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,740
coming home so interesting that that's

524
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,180
on there really and there there is a

525
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,620
little I'm not sure if you can really

526
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,530
see it there so but there's a little

527
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:56,000
location thing there so you can see your

528
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,070
timings based on other locations so

529
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,440
again looking at thinking well I listen

530
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,060
to music at what time you know those

531
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,230
sorts of times why is that interesting

532
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,630
but then again like I said I can gain

533
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,950
all sorts of information that coupled

534
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,900
with other things so if you're listening

535
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,400
to music at certain time base at a

536
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,170
certain location is that where you work

537
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,850
is that where your are you coming home

538
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,800
at certain time that builds a picture of

539
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,200
your your working habits or your daily

540
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,820
habits your daily routine what sort of

541
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,320
music do you listen to a certain times

542
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,750
maybe when your significant other leaves

543
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,000
the house you blast out you know thrash

544
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,050
metal and go crazy

545
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,440
but then when your partners in you keep

546
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,060
income whatever you know again so

547
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,640
building psychometric profiles is

548
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,840
there's quite worrying really like last

549
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,300
I said this is a very very kind of

550
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,280
surface scratch as to the source of

551
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,930
information and the source of profiling

552
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,020
that Spotify using one of the things I

553
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,580
will say with Spotify for brands is that

554
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,810
they're using this information to give

555
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,460
to insurance companies so for argument's

556
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,190
sake if you're driving your car and you

557
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,260
let's say I'll give you I'll give you a

558
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,570
hypothetical scenario you you are

559
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,700
driving you cut your car and you have an

560
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,240
accident

561
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,940
you crash into someone no one's hurt but

562
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,790
damage only whatever it might be

563
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,570
wouldn't it be interesting if the

564
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,700
insurance company could review this kind

565
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,920
of data and suggest well adapt

566
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,660
kela time you were listening to music

567
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,540
that had an average speed of 145 beats

568
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,140
per minute

569
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,610
therefore your heart rate was increased

570
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:19,010
therefore you're sinking perhaps or if

571
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,420
it was like a thrash metal or whatever

572
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,790
it was that indicates that you're

573
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,550
thinking at the time my you know might

574
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,020
be in line with the certain psychometric

575
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,150
profile therefore you may have taken

576
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,070
more risks so actually you may be more

577
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,840
liable for the accident therefore we're

578
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,700
going to void your insurance stand

579
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,250
silence or just maybe I'm losing people

580
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,220
I don't move on again like I said this

581
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,950
is just food for for here it's kind of

582
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,910
thinking about a lot of things that

583
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,040
there that's another you know all the

584
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,360
things that are kind of going on now so

585
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,870
we move on to listening devices you know

586
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,970
fantastic AI assistants I asked my

587
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,680
Google assistant all sorts of things all

588
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,380
the time about what weather is and you

589
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,940
know random questions and it usually

590
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,170
gives me the wrong answer because it

591
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,680
never understands my voice but yeah I

592
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,630
mean same thing I mean if again if

593
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,740
you've got if you've got a Google

594
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,110
listening device to Google home you can

595
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,700
go onto Google account and actually look

596
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,650
through your entire history and see and

597
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,720
go through the recordings of everything

598
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,040
that you've ever asked it you can play

599
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,260
back the recording which they say it's

600
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,580
useful their you know their voice

601
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,710
algorithms and all the rest of it but it

602
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,350
makes you wonder if you play back fat

603
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,060
and the whole passive listening thing

604
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,800
you know what else are they recording

605
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,060
what they listening to yes they might

606
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,010
kind of assure you with data proof seein

607
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,470
gdpr and and whatnot that you know

608
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,730
they're only recording and they're only

609
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,280
keeping some snippets but again there

610
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,750
are plenty of examples that you can find

611
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,660
online through Amazon and extra and

612
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,700
software in where conversations have

613
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,350
been recorded and sent on to employers

614
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,270
inadvertently or there's been actual

615
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,580
police investigations using things that

616
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,020
have been recorded through smart TV

617
00:25:54,020 --> 00:26:00,010
devices and that was hypothetically yeah

618
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:04,460
hypothetically I will say a group of

619
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,040
individuals that were planning something

620
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,560
in a particular country something not so

621
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,180
nice and they were discussing it in

622
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,490
front of their Samsung TV and it was all

623
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,260
recorded on their smart listening to on

624
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,050
the smart TV and the authorities were

625
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,210
alerted I mean obviously that was a lot

626
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,290
of other kind of stuff going on there

627
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,610
but I'm not suggesting that

628
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,200
you guys are scheming horrible things at

629
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,570
home but it's just that now everyone has

630
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,650
a set of ears in their house so um I put

631
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,540
speech analysis there purely because of

632
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,580
we've all heard that line when we call

633
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,150
them you know if we call up I know fast

634
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,580
co-op's guy and I'm wanting to change my

635
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,900
package and you hear the whole this call

636
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,160
will be Mont you know recorded for

637
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,750
monitoring and marketing purposes or

638
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,380
whatever it might be

639
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,390
well actually doing now is using speech

640
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,290
analysis to again profile you determine

641
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,660
you know if you're in a bad mood not you

642
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,580
I find if I'm waiting on hold

643
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,320
I might just kind of talk calmly and I

644
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,600
actually get an operator who is licensed

645
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,919
to me it sounds a bit strange but if you

646
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,750
if you're on hold and you're there

647
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,520
cursing and all for goodness sake um

648
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,530
whatever more than likely the person

649
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,700
when they pick up the phone is going to

650
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,900
be quite standoffish with you because

651
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,250
they've been alerted that this but yeah

652
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,830
this is not happy also if you're calling

653
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,120
up about your insurance policies and

654
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,830
that kind of thing again they'll be

655
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,030
profiling you based on your

656
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,620
conversations and how you're interacting

657
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,690
and and that kind of thing so I mean

658
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,000
there's a lot of again there's a massive

659
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,250
deep dive that we can go into that which

660
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,950
we won't because we just don't have time

661
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,740
in household routines again knowing what

662
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,120
you're doing in a house and who you're

663
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,130
doing it with and what you're doing at

664
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,600
certain times and that kinda thing so

665
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,010
see this is all scary anything you know

666
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,360
now we're at this point we're thinking

667
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,040
everything I do is being monitored and

668
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,020
used against me I can't say anything

669
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,549
anywhere without some what you know a

670
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:46,799
phone or some device picking it up what

671
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,960
am I gonna do I'm gonna put my tinfoil

672
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,210
hat on and map myself up you know in

673
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,760
Faraday material and you know hopefully

674
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,510
you know I'm affect me so I mean I don't

675
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,919
need to talk about VPNs because we all

676
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,330
know if it VPNs are so I can kind of

677
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,720
skip college just skip that slide and

678
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,160
obviously women to talk about VPNs

679
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,980
that's just securing you know the track

680
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,900
you know the data transfer right it's

681
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,240
not actually you know we're talking

682
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,919
about what the company is at where the

683
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,210
data is going as opposed to it being

684
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,900
intercepted in transit so again so we've

685
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,210
talked about how come more how companies

686
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,820
storing data metadata for profiling

687
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,200
that's the big one profiling and

688
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,090
metadata everything we generate is not

689
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,280
you know everything in that you can

690
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,720
think of when you're buying your

691
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,309
supermarket shopping you're using a

692
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:33,960
Tesco Clubcard there a reason that

693
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,730
you've got loyalty cup club cards is to

694
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,960
profile what you're buying

695
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,580
where you're buying them and you know

696
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,179
selling that information to advertisers

697
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:43,230
you're browsing in you're purchasing

698
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,230
data again online for advertisers I'm

699
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,510
sure I mean it goes from the basic thing

700
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,130
on Amazon where you buy a book and it

701
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,590
says other users bought this based on

702
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,360
that or it might be I'm not sure of some

703
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,590
of you have noticed it but I notice

704
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,970
sometimes if I'm talking about a

705
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,470
particular subject when I'm at home or

706
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,039
somewhere else

707
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,570
the next time I go on my Amazon app

708
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,460
strangely enough it's suggesting that

709
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,529
you know there's this particular book or

710
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:05,700
there's this particular item that I

711
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,140
might be interested in and I just so

712
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,520
happened that I was talking about it a

713
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,020
couple of days ago that's really

714
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,429
worrying me

715
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:13,500
but again and then you kind of go into

716
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,299
the conversation of well are they

717
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:16,710
actually helping me and suggesting

718
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:19,919
things that I want or are they kind of

719
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,409
almost grooming me to want certain

720
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:23,820
things and there's an interesting TED

721
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,919
talk about that about the chapel's using

722
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,330
those sorts of techniques in advertising

723
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,620
where they're actually grooming people

724
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,929
to buy instead of suggesting to you that

725
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:32,520
you want a pair of these shoes or these

726
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,779
shoes are really nice and you might like

727
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,809
them it's almost as though these are the

728
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,279
shoes that you need they're creating the

729
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,779
demand for the shoe as opposed to

730
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,059
following you know the month of the shoe

731
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:42,720
if that makes sense

732
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,039
I mean they use the shoe as an example

733
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,080
so yeah so we're going into data misuse

734
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,520
does anyone know about ubers God view no

735
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,020
it's not really a pub is always not a

736
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,730
publicly accessible thing essentially

737
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,870
with good with with uber internally I

738
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,330
suppose they're their employees can

739
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:06,690
access that the uber tracking systems

740
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,130
they can see all of their overdrive

741
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,080
drivers and all of the users and where

742
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,880
they are and there was a bit of a misuse

743
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,510
issue when a reporter was due to be

744
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,640
meeting with an uber executive and was

745
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,049
late for the meeting so an employee

746
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:21,320
access assistant to see where they were

747
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,399
Buber slates and claimed that they only

748
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,929
use it for legitimate purposes and

749
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:29,010
whatnot but the fact that that is

750
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,260
accessible is a bit of a concern because

751
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,630
again anyone that has the uber app can

752
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:36,390
be tracked google deepmind and the wall

753
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,549
free they'll know about that kind of

754
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:42,990
misuse of data showing no okay the wall

755
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,799
free hospital in London obviously lots

756
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,600
and lots of medical records and patient

757
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,730
data they decided that there were

758
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,000
work with google deepmind and share 1.6

759
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,770
million patient records with the

760
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,370
deepmind

761
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,910
for as google say legitimate research

762
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:04,020
and kind of analytical purposes but

763
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,090
there was an assumes consent though

764
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,700
their patients weren't asked would you

765
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,710
like us to share your data with whoever

766
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,910
I'm not sure many patients probably

767
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,960
would have agree but the fact it was

768
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,760
just there was an assumption of well

769
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,070
it's our data more handover I'm still a

770
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,110
bit of a boo-boo there kami jamming it

771
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,780
occur everyone knows about that so when

772
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,419
you talk about that third I put

773
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:25,890
third-party permissions in frienemies

774
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,090
there that's an interesting concept

775
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,370
third party permissions we all know a

776
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,190
big one with Facebook they used to have

777
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,870
the and when we talk about data

778
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,309
ownership right and transferring

779
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:38,880
ownership to other parties you know

780
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,820
through consent to whatever and with

781
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,620
third party permissions if you think of

782
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,240
anyone on Facebook if you ever had one

783
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,520
of those quizzes that says find out what

784
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,320
your Lord of the Rings character is or

785
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,140
you know what what what day of the week

786
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,090
are you and then you go oh yeah I want

787
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,010
to find out you know if I'm Gandalf or

788
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:58,260
if I'm Frodo and you and you click on it

789
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,179
and the first thing it pops up is do you

790
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,820
give whatever access you know to see

791
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,200
your profile and did it do the most of

792
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,160
the time you just click you know might

793
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,390
whatever cuz I want to find out but I'm

794
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,640
Gandalf so you click on that and they

795
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,190
get access to your contacts or your your

796
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,750
profile and you do your quiz and you

797
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,790
find out that I'll know your Sam you're

798
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,580
not Gandalf that's a bit sad and you

799
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,110
forget about it and then you move on but

800
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,970
and then you forget that that permission

801
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,549
is still there and you you can deep dive

802
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:25,140
in your Facebook settings and actually

803
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,760
see all of the permissions for all of

804
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,830
these historic apps and even recently

805
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,500
like Farmville was one that haunted me a

806
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,040
long long time ago but yeah but that's

807
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,270
the sort of stuff that the general

808
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,500
they're creating these kinds of quizzes

809
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,270
and things to get access to your

810
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,040
facebook details I know a lot people now

811
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,919
are a bit more savvy to it so perhaps

812
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,140
it's not as big of a thing and I've put

813
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,360
frenemies there purely because an

814
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,309
interesting sort of again I've got to be

815
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:54,630
careful with how I've saying this book

816
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,320
is being recorded

817
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,430
in an open it wasn't OSINT earlier open

818
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,800
source intelligence and let's just say

819
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,450
hypothetically that's gonna be my magic

820
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,890
words per se when i say hypothetically

821
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,600
because it might not actually happen but

822
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,950
who knows maybe I'm telling the truth

823
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,160
but then hypothetically back in the day

824
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,440
of you know early Facebook days where

825
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,150
everyone was rushing to get you know how

826
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,760
many friends can I get meeting engine

827
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,100
time mate so um yeah how many friends

828
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,360
could people how many friends could

829
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,740
people have and they're kind of

830
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,120
accepting everyone and this and the

831
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,250
other so that let's just say that

832
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,930
potentially there could have been active

833
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,570
measures by certain law enforcement

834
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,340
agencies that say that would generate

835
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,310
kind of profiles based on new injury

836
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,590
individual let's say that Stewart there

837
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:42,640
on the front row has you know a total or

838
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,930
unlike for a particular type of

839
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,610
individual but I've found out about

840
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,500
based on his pornhub search history and

841
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,110
so I doctor this profile with a

842
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,480
particular profile picture and some

843
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,490
interesting details that students can

844
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,990
look at and go yeah actually yeah oh

845
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,390
yeah do I like do I know them oh I don't

846
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,470
know because you know I like that

847
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,610
picture so I'm gonna like them and

848
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,720
straightaway you've got access to

849
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,540
Facebook page somewhere argue that's not

850
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,910
open source it's a bit of a debate am I

851
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,330
going to I am we've covered Spotify so

852
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:11,860
I'm gonna start flying now because I've

853
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,020
been waffling and TLDR we all know what

854
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,929
that is right too long didn't read yeah

855
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,370
we all know that when you kind of

856
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,840
install itunes and then you've got to

857
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,418
accept the 76 page terms and conditions

858
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:24,300
and you actually read any of that

859
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,380
usually that's where they just stuff all

860
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,639
of this kind of thing so it's quite

861
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,659
interesting when you've got the time and

862
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:30,850
if you're that way inclined perhaps you

863
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,889
should take a look at the terms and

864
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:34,060
conditions but without further ado I'll

865
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,610
hand over to my colleague because

866
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,790
otherwise we're not gonna have any time

867
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,260
sure thanks Nick shame tell us X and

868
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,500
actually so benefits of station before

869
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,510
we do that I mean are you guys like just

870
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,000
out of interest cuz generations then

871
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,100
that most you guys are in that area I

872
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,770
think or the era of younger generation

873
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,030
are you worried about all this beta

874
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,670
stuff you know I mean before people say

875
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,170
oh I don't care but I mean now it's like

876
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,940
becoming kind of rapport I mean now you

877
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,890
don't know if you knew all this stuff I

878
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,050
mean you know we're we're research into

879
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,250
a lot of this with a lot of errors we're

880
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,420
looking into it but it the more you look

881
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,920
into it the more scary it gets to be

882
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,970
honest with you and you start to think

883
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,260
actually I don't wanna share

884
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,170
but we have to look at this this is you

885
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,330
know the the benefits of of you know

886
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,430
data sharing in a good way as well I

887
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,650
mean it means you want to look at its

888
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,380
medical why because you know we can all

889
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,930
put so many examples into this as you

890
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,850
know basically your longer to know

891
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,950
medical history everything from day one

892
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,750
right till now which could be a huge

893
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,550
benefit if you're in control of it

894
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,100
meaning you know if I go to India next

895
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,170
week I have an accident you know as long

896
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,910
as I'm conscious I can actually say to

897
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:40,960
him guys don't bother with all these

898
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,760
x-rays and everything you look I busted

899
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,190
my ACL some time ago be careful there

900
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,440
here's all my Asian history here at his

901
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,750
access to it without running every test

902
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,430
or whatever medical condition you've got

903
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,560
but you need to be in control of it you

904
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,120
need to know that's the ownership word

905
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,820
right interrupts ability I mean you know

906
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,010
all the silos of day I mean we came from

907
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,440
physical records which the only problem

908
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,760
with physical records is if someone

909
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,530
actually breaks in and steals and more

910
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,600
building burns down but now it's went to

911
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,570
electronic records which is great but

912
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,460
they're still held in silos still no

913
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,930
good to everyone because no one sharing

914
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:16,630
data so the interoperability is a key

915
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,550
one between many organizations many

916
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,800
hospitals many you know in the whole

917
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,770
ecosystem of medical care unless you

918
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,360
equation written repeats of data that's

919
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,640
obvious streamlining infrastructure

920
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,200
again that's obvious because that's all

921
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,070
commercially beneficial and I would say

922
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,510
end-to-end supply chain transparency

923
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,970
wallets commercially beneficial you got

924
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,680
to look at also it's actually beneficial

925
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,860
to us because think about drug that

926
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,080
custody the chain of custody for drugs

927
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,610
right I mean I'm talking about legal

928
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,950
ones yeah and basically you know

929
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,840
everything from is sauce where it's

930
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,360
manufactured right through to supply if

931
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,890
it's not tracked how do we know it's not

932
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,570
counterfeit we know that there's like I

933
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,400
can't even remember the exact stats ten

934
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,140
twenty percent of all drugs out there

935
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,810
are counterfeit you know legally so so

936
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,090
that's a key thing and then if you look

937
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,040
at the individual centric or patient

938
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,390
centric approach I was talking about

939
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,660
making that person responsible

940
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,190
themselves to actually who's accessing

941
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,650
are there as long as they can actually

942
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,370
see that sort of chain of custody

943
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,170
smart infrastructure we told you about

944
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,460
that so on a project where they're going

945
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,990
to be many projects like that and that's

946
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,190
what I'm talking about that data

947
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:24,970
explosion

948
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,490
you've got no choice in that and that's

949
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,570
going to interact with you when you

950
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,250
enter that zone it knows you're there in

951
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,440
fact you came here last week why don't

952
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,390
you hire that chair over there in cafe

953
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,820
Nero and have that clatter you usually

954
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,040
have how it's all going to interact you

955
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,190
that way so whether you like it or not

956
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,660
law enforcement there obviously for

957
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,510
safety of you know where we are what our

958
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,250
daily lives that says that's obvious

959
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,230
there it's a slightly advancement and

960
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:54,220
advertising we'll skip through that so

961
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,470
yeah smart wearable day are really so I

962
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,210
mean there's gonna be billions of

963
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,800
devices right I mean that's without a

964
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,960
fact Internet of Things is running that

965
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,970
kind of like ways forwards I would say

966
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,080
and this is 27 24/7 data collection

967
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,260
process so you know everything that you

968
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,400
know no longer we need to talk to a

969
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,320
patient basically we can put device on

970
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,490
them and capture everything in the cloud

971
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:18,790
and everything's seamlessly reported so

972
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,040
basically what's the danger that is is

973
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,810
well again I don't have the ownership of

974
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,210
it the institution has ownership that's

975
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:28,030
fine but I don't have any access to and

976
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,980
I don't have any control over it smart

977
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,010
cities many third part is accessing this

978
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,349
data and you know I'd want to cross to

979
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:36,790
much wonder show instead but that's kind

980
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,530
of what we're talking about there but

981
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,660
that flexible approach I'm talking about

982
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,480
if we could have some control then

983
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,849
actually you could decide if you want to

984
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:48,220
donate this data say like if I'm a

985
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,690
diabetic and actually I want to really

986
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,550
want to do something about that I'm fed

987
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,010
up of that condition maybe if I donate

988
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,349
something to pharmaceuticals in terms of

989
00:38:56,349 --> 00:38:58,510
my data I don't even want to premium a

990
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,250
premium could be offered back to me but

991
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,710
I don't I'm prepared to donate globally

992
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,660
as a service part one of the things I

993
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,510
want back is maybe some something back

994
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,790
in terms of knowledge I'll get a report

995
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,820
from a pharmacy I'll get a report on

996
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,780
conditions and globally in the world and

997
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,160
the trends and what they're doing so I'm

998
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,960
not left in a dark that I think would be

999
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:23,380
significant yeah so I don't know how

1000
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,580
many of you know aware of like the

1001
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,640
digital twin kind of methodology right

1002
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,190
so this is essentially what's happening

1003
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,080
right now and it's it's going to explode

1004
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,839
up because many reasons obviously one in

1005
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,390
terms of efficiencies and terms of like

1006
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,150
improve

1007
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:40,400
all sorts of things but it's a

1008
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,660
connection between the physical and

1009
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,339
digital world and you know really

1010
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,410
essentially using Internet of Things so

1011
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,059
you know NASA was the first to develop

1012
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:49,430
this technology in terms of simulation

1013
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,140
what would he be like on Mars and all

1014
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,210
that sort of stuff so that could

1015
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,990
actually preempt everything in advance

1016
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,099
you can you know create this virtual

1017
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:01,930
product process facility and all sorts

1018
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,579
as I say a massive demand you know look

1019
00:40:04,579 --> 00:40:07,940
16 billion as a market in 2023 Garner's

1020
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,069
prediction 21 billion connected sensors

1021
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:12,259
an input so you know it's huge benefits

1022
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:13,789
are there it's real-time simulation

1023
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:16,249
particularly if we model it on a person

1024
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:18,859
we could actually I would say do

1025
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:22,249
something on individually developing the

1026
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:25,309
drug specific to them right so there are

1027
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:27,259
those sorts of benefits you're talking

1028
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:32,779
about but if we look at what the ethical

1029
00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:34,730
and privacy issues are whether there's a

1030
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,279
lot there actually because it might be

1031
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:39,499
actually a way of discriminating or

1032
00:40:39,499 --> 00:40:41,960
leter segmentation some it might not be

1033
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,700
accessible for they may make decisions

1034
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,989
say well there's no point giving this to

1035
00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:46,279
you because we've already assessed this

1036
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:49,279
all artificially you know how far do we

1037
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:50,569
go in terms of biohacking

1038
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:52,700
to improve ourselves and you know this

1039
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,710
therapy and human enhancement we're

1040
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,019
talking about personalized medicines and

1041
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:57,559
so on

1042
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,539
so I'll just skip through cuz I know I'm

1043
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:02,630
short on time so data threat factors I

1044
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,739
don't think need to go up that much you

1045
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:05,089
guys have seen some presentations today

1046
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:07,220
you know who these kind of attackers are

1047
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,200
what they do you know the individuals

1048
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,579
are hari mal was a service

1049
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:13,190
state-sponsored attacks and and so on

1050
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,839
and the common methods right I mean

1051
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,400
those are just a brand and bunch of

1052
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,259
methods but they tend to be their most

1053
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:20,480
popular ones and phishing still hugely

1054
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,640
successful if you look at how they took

1055
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,289
down a critical national infrastructure

1056
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:26,749
in Ukraine in 2011 through a phishing

1057
00:41:26,749 --> 00:41:29,029
attack coordinating over many months of

1058
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:30,349
course because once you're in you've got

1059
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:32,180
to find out all the passwords before you

1060
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,309
shut a power grid down so that's their

1061
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:40,609
power of a state-sponsored attack and

1062
00:41:40,609 --> 00:41:42,799
cyber tech now hit quickly I mean you

1063
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:44,749
know obviously that the main one that's

1064
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:46,309
getting hit is healthcare primarily

1065
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:49,249
because it's premium data why because

1066
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:51,490
identity theft right

1067
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,380
one a cry was an obvious attack you guys

1068
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,940
all know about we live in the UK and

1069
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,610
it's was a disaster that weekend and the

1070
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:02,680
power grid stuff and of course you know

1071
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,210
what's the main combination with dissing

1072
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,950
correlation and some analysis in various

1073
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,540
sectors but the main thing is malicious

1074
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,180
Outsiders for the purpose of identity

1075
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,610
theft right so they're really targeting

1076
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:14,290
for identity theft so if everything's

1077
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:17,530
held in trusted third parties well you

1078
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,760
know the problem is it's like Swiss

1079
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,200
cheese and some some operations

1080
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,390
including health care particularly which

1081
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,520
is why that gets hit a lot so what we're

1082
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,600
saying is what we could do about well

1083
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,890
there are some things like block

1084
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,930
chaining me I'm not advocating block

1085
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:29,800
change the thing there could be

1086
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,030
something else that comes along that is

1087
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,710
much better than that but at the moment

1088
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,210
it gives you that kind of like

1089
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,400
mutability or durability you know gives

1090
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,690
you that increased security obviously

1091
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,030
transparency protects that privacy and

1092
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,340
so on how we do it well there's a number

1093
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,870
of ways and my kind of models are

1094
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,780
looking for industry it's more in the

1095
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,520
permissioned and where data is held off

1096
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,950
the chain so that we can just have it as

1097
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,520
I think an authentication mechanism so

1098
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,500
actually pretty much that date is still

1099
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,780
held in cloud and data lakes but the

1100
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,700
only way to access is through it is

1101
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:04,360
through the blockchain and that's just a

1102
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,100
moment one of the real quick model we

1103
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,080
looking at I mean we've talked about

1104
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,110
healthcare records you know we've talked

1105
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,030
about those benefits so for patients and

1106
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,850
so on and obviously commercially in all

1107
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,590
that side of it all the way through to

1108
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,260
using blockchain but in clinical trials

1109
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,670
if you look at that then this is a huge

1110
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:24,160
area where it really transparency if

1111
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,920
they are ownership and all the issues of

1112
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,960
privacy are all kind of having to have a

1113
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,520
lot of problems and everything from

1114
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,650
inform setting up a trial to inform

1115
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,420
consent all the way to outcomes

1116
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,310
everything seems to be selectively

1117
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,470
reporting a lot of bias you end up with

1118
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:39,790
drugs in the market that could have

1119
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:42,670
problems as podu farmer who are back in

1120
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,070
the newspapers again 26 billion they've

1121
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:47,260
made and 200,000 people dead in the u.s.

1122
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:51,130
because of opioid abuse so you know that

1123
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:55,870
that is a major issue and identity then

1124
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,430
so what does identity oh that's just a

1125
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:59,050
Latin thing there which means I think

1126
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,070
therefore I am

1127
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,470
kognito ogle some but basically it's a

1128
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,720
sum of attributes obviously what you are

1129
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,210
about

1130
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,760
person you know characteristics possible

1131
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,320
numbers and so on of how we do it there

1132
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,380
are a number of different ways and

1133
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,000
basically how we're doing this at the

1134
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,860
moment is how do we interact with our

1135
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,270
identity we'd give it everywhere because

1136
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,550
we have two insurance home insurance car

1137
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,230
insurance whatever think about that you

1138
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,210
have to give your details first as a

1139
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:25,520
quote to get a quote rather before you

1140
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,900
can actually buy a service maybe I don't

1141
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,400
want these companies I just did it

1142
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,870
recently myself because my wife's forced

1143
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,430
me to do life insurance and I was

1144
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,820
running out of time and unfortunately I

1145
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,840
didn't think too much into and I put

1146
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,980
this data right there now I've got all

1147
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,570
sorts of phone calls all sorts of emails

1148
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:41,240
and that's the disaster so so basically

1149
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,760
a lot of people falsify their

1150
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,460
information now I mean I do on sites

1151
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,050
that you don't need where it's not on

1152
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:50,690
official right because what's the point

1153
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,130
of giving you a real name and date of

1154
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:52,660
birth

1155
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:56,690
so basically another way of this current

1156
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,100
way of doing is it's what some guys

1157
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,330
another presentation have said obviously

1158
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,490
is through Google or Facebook log in

1159
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,390
universal login

1160
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:04,580
that sounds great it's ease of access

1161
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,590
and all that kind of side of it but then

1162
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:08,600
you've got the problems of obviously

1163
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,250
giving permissions to all the third

1164
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:13,100
party the trackers add trackers and so

1165
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,750
on that now have access to all your data

1166
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:21,650
you know your um oops yeah sorry that's

1167
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,270
it yeah just me with pivoting around

1168
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,190
access to your name you know your

1169
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,360
birthday and all that sort of

1170
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,250
information we've talked about Cambridge

1171
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,810
at only America and that's exactly what

1172
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,150
happened on that one so the future could

1173
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:33,680
be that I mean it could be a self

1174
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,480
sovereign I mean basically what we're

1175
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,520
saying there is is you don't need to

1176
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,930
rely on these third parties you have a

1177
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:40,580
virtual you have a real identity of a

1178
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,810
digital identity I'm in a virtual

1179
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:43,430
identity a number of virtual identities

1180
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:45,050
actually and this is a concept that's

1181
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,310
been thought of out there there are a

1182
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,140
number of companies looking at that it

1183
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,540
is interesting so taken for example a

1184
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,330
bank if you want to set up a bank count

1185
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,680
I've been Banking with Berkeley since I

1186
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,200
mean 14 years old why would I need to

1187
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,720
give all my details again to Lloyds for

1188
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,900
example you know I uncredible the rules

1189
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,940
and so on right I'm just you know so

1190
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,830
just an example of a bank name not to

1191
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,170
say those to a particular but but if you

1192
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,730
could give your virtual identity then

1193
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,560
that would suffice it because as far as

1194
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,240
that other bank the new banks concern is

1195
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,710
they know that you're a bona fide you

1196
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,360
person you're credible and have the

1197
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,770
worthiness because

1198
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,330
you're a virtual identity has been

1199
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:22,790
obviously sanity checked in a sense of

1200
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:24,380
whoever's and whoever could be looking

1201
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,210
after this it could be something like

1202
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,310
the future all of a bank so these are

1203
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:29,390
some of the things that have been

1204
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:31,610
thought about so in summary because you

1205
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:34,100
can see there's any questions you can't

1206
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,660
stop that experience your growth data

1207
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,950
growth there's no way gonna stop that

1208
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,320
that's happening there are many benefits

1209
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,820
associate have talked about the

1210
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,260
interment believe they are interchange

1211
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,590
data sharing of course with our fish and

1212
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:46,940
television machine learning it's all

1213
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,619
gonna get better instruction because 80%

1214
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:50,420
of the world's data is unstructured at

1215
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,100
the moment so the more that can we can

1216
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,420
help curate their data the more

1217
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,430
intelligent will become however there's

1218
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,470
a greater exposure as you've seen to

1219
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,110
your privacy of data you know the less

1220
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,720
transparency of how they or what use is

1221
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,130
they're going to do with the day at this

1222
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:06,110
data collection and this dilution of

1223
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:07,190
ownership has already happened it's

1224
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,690
already out there your name is already

1225
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,640
you know reused so many times and your

1226
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,500
details are reused so many times so if

1227
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,760
we can't stop it then perhaps we could

1228
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,170
have better control mechanisms was my

1229
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,420
thought as a personal you know kind of

1230
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,000
view on this presentation you know we

1231
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,810
need to look at the legal

1232
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:22,550
infrastructures and frameworks that's

1233
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,470
something that government and and you

1234
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:26,630
know organizations need to do but there

1235
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:28,310
could be some things like blockchain or

1236
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,260
digital identities and something we can

1237
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,190
all do ourselves to have that

1238
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:33,440
situational awareness of where and what

1239
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,820
we do with our data as I gave you the

1240
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,800
bad example of what I did a month ago

1241
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,320
with my life insurance business you know

1242
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,210
trying to get a quote which was just cuz

1243
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:44,240
I was in a hurry so that it's kind of

1244
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,070
like where we're at as the end of the

1245
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:49,580
presentation and I just you know to kind

1246
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,770
of like really pull it pull us along to

1247
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:54,109
any questions or any thoughts you've got

1248
00:47:54,109 --> 00:47:57,770
any comments please Scott it and only

1249
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,960
final thoughts emissions and say I mean

1250
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,750
really but I think the whole point of

1251
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,970
this presentation and think of the other

1252
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:06,260
presentations that have been going on

1253
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:06,970
today

1254
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:10,430
like with Becker's one earlier about why

1255
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:15,020
users are exploitive at security I think

1256
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,160
we're really talking about we had

1257
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,630
previously by design and security by

1258
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,220
design obviously privacy by design is

1259
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:23,359
the gdpr thing but you know ethical by

1260
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,310
design really we're trying to not just

1261
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:28,250
look at it from a mechanism point of

1262
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,530
view or you know put all the onus on

1263
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:32,110
companies and we're

1264
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,430
science or whatever to make sure that

1265
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:34,810
their things are secure and that they do

1266
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,550
things in a particular way but almost

1267
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,440
using that privacy or security by design

1268
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,540
concept in the way that we think and the

1269
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,220
way that we do things and being aware of

1270
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,900
what's actually happening with our

1271
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,270
nature and how it's being used and you

1272
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:48,070
know we might be happy to be giving

1273
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:50,950
certain sets of data you know in certain

1274
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:52,930
instances but just being bit more a

1275
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,610
little bit I suppose really but yeah so

1276
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:59,830
that was a kind of a yeah flying field

1277
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:07,930
Wars yeah yeah people make so much money

1278
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:09,400
about why did we see companies getting

1279
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,050
poor because they're selling some

1280
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,190
devices they're not they're getting good

1281
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,950
for the day that's it so do you have any

1282
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:54,850
questions yes yes essentially you're

1283
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:58,030
saying different companies are creating

1284
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,200
or building these data to all these

1285
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,910
profiles based on your data so whether

1286
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:03,520
it's in silo from Facebook or Google or

1287
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,060
Amazon or whoever forever and by

1288
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,770
themselves that's fine because you give

1289
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:12,070
them certain data but you're asking so

1290
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,420
who is it that's actually looking at the

1291
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:18,760
whole overview government agencies I

1292
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:26,050
suppose well I don't suppose oh yeah so

1293
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,880
I think that's the thing so like out

1294
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,610
alphabet Inc for example who own a lot

1295
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,960
of companies so even though these

1296
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,190
particular companies have certain

1297
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:35,110
snippets or certain kind of slices of

1298
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:37,560
your data pie as it were

1299
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,850
yeah these larger kind of umbrella

1300
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:41,950
companies will then hold larger chunks

1301
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:45,370
and then if I'm talking from a profiling

1302
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:46,000
point of view

1303
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,500
so if you're thinking of law enforcement

1304
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,910
where you start kind of taking these

1305
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:50,920
sections and building this data profile

1306
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,230
and obviously in if we're talking about

1307
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:58,630
kind of how I phrase this Western

1308
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:01,210
democracies let's say where you trust

1309
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,770
the government 10 perhaps that's fine

1310
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,780
because everything's toward but perhaps

1311
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,270
you're kind of if you then think of a

1312
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:11,200
more dystopian future or government's

1313
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,150
where if they've got access to this kind

1314
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:14,890
of data again I mentioned Shenzhen in

1315
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:16,780
China purely because they're actually

1316
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,030
profiling people and seeing how they

1317
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:22,800
rank according to the Communist ideal

1318
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:31,420
that's very dangerous right hmm yeah

1319
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,940
yeah no exactly and nothing but and

1320
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,870
exactly and and that's what and that's

1321
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:36,370
where the that's where the ethical bar

1322
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:38,250
design kind of concept comes in about

1323
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,660
you know ensuring you know and we talk

1324
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,110
about democracy in everything that the

1325
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:47,350
powers at play you know making sure that

1326
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,300
you know they're governed appropriately

1327
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,650
so that if they're handling our data

1328
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:51,880
that they're doing it perfectly right

1329
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,560
but obviously but we need to be aware

1330
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,180
about what's actually happening so then

1331
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,610
we can actually govern you know how it's

1332
00:51:57,610 --> 00:51:58,930
being treated because otherwise if we

1333
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:01,750
don't know then it just gets abused and

1334
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:08,830
abused I suppose yeah sorry I know yeah

1335
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:12,640
yeah I mean yeah yeah it's fine I mean

1336
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,800
yeah I mean sorry guys I mean I know I

1337
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,660
waffled on a lot I mean it is an issuing

1338
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,170
subject but
