1
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:39,430
today in an introduction to exploit
development

2
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:50,089
welcome how many of you were at my
presentation yesterday while ok so I

3
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:53,559
just would like to go over to the
highlights for I think there are one or

4
00:00:53,559 --> 00:01:00,250
two people that were not there just to
go over to the thing the main idea was

5
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:06,970
that Turkish and is our turkish delights
again if you could just come home that

6
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,960
was the important part yes thank you

7
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,100
well today we are going to talk about
exploit development for noobs but you

8
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,039
know as I always say I'm not a hooker
penetration tester so I had to learn

9
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,640
these things and it took me some time so
I'm just going to explain it the way I

10
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,440
learned that so it might be boring for
some of us interesting from others so

11
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,380
anyway so i right

12
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:46,320
serbia two days ago this was the first
thing I saw at the airport you know if

13
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,648
this was the question I'm asking how
come we still cannot write a decent

14
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:58,119
piece of software and our software that
doesn't fail why you know his 2015

15
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,410
already and we're still right software
with bugs and errors and that they still

16
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:07,830
have a couple i mean is it just our
company that cannot do that I just

17
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,869
compiled some examples here

18
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:17,930
Mars climate orbiter was launched in
December my date it was supposed to

19
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:24,620
reach martian you know turnaround orbit
Mars for some time in order to gather

20
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:31,560
information on the climate what happened
is that it entered orbit lower than it

21
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,370
was planned and crashed this was like
three hundred million dollars piece of

22
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:43,700
software that crashed because the Calder
who was writing because he during this

23
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,589
trajectory calculation he just took two
different units of measure and he

24
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:55,750
multiplied them so the result was
something very strange and it crashed

25
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,650
again Mariner was planned to go to
Venice Venice 4:02

26
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,640
look around I think they have things
that look like season we wanted to know

27
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,738
if they were fishing maybe and the guy
who wrote the code told that this line

28
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,670
in fact which I don't even know what it
is

29
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,170
someone told me once it was 4chan I
don't know how this line he thought it

30
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,760
was a line between two words in the
upper line so instead of a mathematical

31
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,549
formula like this and this also

32
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,100
said life had to be destroyed because
it's deviated from the treasure Korean

33
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,049
instead of going to space it was going
on a city they had to blow it up

34
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:48,100
night was a company that bought and sold
stuck in the united states and they had

35
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,670
some servers that did this automatically
if they found a stock that was lower

36
00:03:53,670 --> 00:04:00,660
than it should be about it and when the
price went up its sold it for as long as

37
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,859
it could and they decided to update the
software and without testing it they

38
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:12,270
deploy the update what happened is that
in around 30 minutes they lost 400 over

39
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,030
four hundred million dollars because the
software it was buying high and selling

40
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:22,210
when the prices dropped again mister and
more

41
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:28,190
misstate that you know we are familiar
with well heart bleeds ghost these are

42
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:35,169
the two ones that have their own logos
which is interesting for a buck Adobe

43
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:41,979
Flash Player so what happens what makes
us you know not able to write code that

44
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,520
doesn't have flaws there are two main
reasons one the softwares are

45
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,539
complicated really becomes more and more
complicated issue we're going to write

46
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,870
software for a fridge for example right
so far for a fridge you would think

47
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,240
temperature and maybe the the gas in it
but today the fridge

48
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,610
you know we know that they can send
emails or you know check your schedule

49
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:12,060
this is not something you would think
when writing us author for fruit and

50
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,350
they are very easily expendable by
Venable I don't mean that it can be

51
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:22,410
integrated with other solutions just it
grows so fast and so much that you're

52
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,890
not even notice it while you're writing
the code and the last point is that yes

53
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,450
we are trying to connect everything to
the internet so it becomes dangerous

54
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,280
complicated yes you know we spoke about

55
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,929
satellites just a few minutes ago so
curious city has around five million

56
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:46,760
lines of code and you know Windows 3.1
if we decided to write a Windows 3.1

57
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:54,219
with her to write over two million lines
of codes today the office 2013 has over

58
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,389
40 million lines of code and Facebook is
that 61 million lines of code and going

59
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:01,220
so why should we

60
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:08,060
why would these lines of codes
interesting statistics show that on any

61
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,040
piece of software that was salt or you
know distributed professional way that

62
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:22,740
is there are around 50 5950 between 1650
errors for every 1000 lines of codes so

63
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:30,000
that's why the the line of codes is an
important parameter for us the cleanroom

64
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,380
technique this is home

65
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,219
nasa and the other big guys they're
developing their software even them

66
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,050
they're not that 0 errors so we make
errors while we are writing articles and

67
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,860
what does it mean for us

68
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:50,500
insecurity it means that on any client
in our network we have around 150,000

69
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:57,600
errors that can be potentially experts
we said that expansion was very easy

70
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,830
that

71
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:06,750
you know we didn't even notice it
sometimes just to give you an idea you

72
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,650
know if I was going to use by them and
you know print a number I want the

73
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:20,020
number on the screen thing I could do
would be this right but if I decided I

74
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:26,609
wanted a random number what I could do
was important function calls random and

75
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:34,390
then just printed from using that for
action and say I want a number between

76
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:40,830
one and 10 this is you know the way I
could do it so just two lines of code

77
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,400
and it allows me to print random numbers
on the screen

78
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,510
this is what we have just seen but when
I say the import random I just included

79
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,890
this into my two lines of code so all
this which I didn't write which I didn't

80
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:00,830
audit which I have no idea about what
it's doing except that it's it tries to

81
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:06,289
provide me with her on the number I
included 692 lines of code you might

82
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:13,610
like so if I had my two lines here there
are 694 lines of course so that's why

83
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:20,090
it's getting out of hand really easily I
really quickly and of course we are

84
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,270
trying to connect everything to the
Internet

85
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:28,390
this is a good thing for some not so
good thing for others the idea of

86
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:33,350
connecting everything to the internet
was a good idea in fact but we decided

87
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:39,409
to do it probably the most stupid way
because someone came up with the idea of

88
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:44,969
browsers we say that we are going to use
brothers in my told yesterday has said

89
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,380
that ok this is our security pusher we
are trying to protect ourselves from

90
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,130
whatever is coming from the Internet
using this layered approach so we have

91
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,550
the firewall the IPS you know I say that
was like the Middle Ages when you were

92
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,770
trying to predict your castle and the
attackers Tuesday instead of calling you

93
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,319
know

94
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,670
security measure from security measure
they just popped in the middle of the

95
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,079
network out of nowhere

96
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,060
one of the ways they do it is using
browsers they attacked the browser so

97
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:20,890
they send a link or email to one of our
users and users click on it because the

98
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,020
guy who were you ever decided that
browser where the day DIA he said that

99
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:30,620
he would create something that would run
on my computer but go and find holds on

100
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,380
the internet and run them on my computer
so this is what the browser does so the

101
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:41,410
browser doesn't finance cold somewhere
else cause I don't know it can receive

102
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,410
comments so from the internet

103
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,790
redirect other comment so I'm trying to
visit one page it's redirected the

104
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:55,910
browser redirects and I have lots of
hands-on applications and update so it's

105
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,209
basically I'm open to the Internet

106
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:05,120
things are getting easier for attackers
as will anyone knows what this is is a

107
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:12,340
bookmarks in 1976 if I wanted to call
myself a hacker I was need one of these

108
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:19,110
so I could either make one or you know
because I'm skip script kiddie I would

109
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,570
have to buy one and two buy one I would
have to go to a university find the guy

110
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,800
who made them installed them because
they were not very illegal so it was not

111
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,370
easy to find these guys and by 10 take
all this risk going to jail on the extra

112
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,889
today I want to be a hiker all have to
do is you know

113
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:46,290
google it tackling has become much
easier as well so we said complexity

114
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:51,019
expansion and connections connectivity
is making everything more dangerous

115
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:56,319
first that's not all we have we are
starting to see that browsers for

116
00:10:56,319 --> 00:11:00,118
example I just gave the example there
are becoming part of the operating

117
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:05,970
system you're running Explorer without
even noticing it on Windows when we are

118
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,279
going mobile we have distributed systems
with more and more applications so

119
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:18,009
everything is becoming more and more
difficult for us if we were able to

120
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:22,799
write code that didn't have any bugs in
it we would be in trouble already with

121
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,459
all this because we know we're trying to
connect everything to everything except

122
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:33,790
Allah but we are also not able to cold
and designed correctly this is admiral

123
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:39,679
grace hopper she she found a bug in her
computers and she taped it in a lot of

124
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,799
some say that this is where the name bug

125
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:50,110
comes from well for us above is not
important there can be a bug in the

126
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,739
software it wouldn't matter

127
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:56,860
security wise because you know it
happens where it starts to become a

128
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:03,459
problem for us is when an attacker can
take advantage he or she can exploit

129
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:10,059
that while there before and I'm talking
about you know errors encoding but are

130
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:14,019
not the only reason we are having
problems we also have some issues

131
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:19,879
designing secure software so we cannot
designed to securely hold it securely so

132
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:25,319
that's why we are having problems errors
that come from the cold sometimes they

133
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:26,209
come from

134
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:31,738
functions we are using you might say
that ok most accomplished today they

135
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:37,759
take care of before but still most of
the software we are using today where

136
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,509
developed or designed or in a part of
the more developed are designed before

137
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:46,740
all this control so we still have
dangerous fortunes in them

138
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:53,279
and but harahan link is also an issue
for us just to give an example of error

139
00:12:53,279 --> 00:13:04,959
handling yesterday's course this is a
screen that once made to write an idea

140
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,529
and it gives me back to the idea that
responds to it so we're better at

141
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:15,230
handling comes in is that if I give him
give it a single coat it will give me an

142
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,390
error message saying that ok

143
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:25,600
the problem is here and by here he it
will tell me show me part of the code

144
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,140
that is running behind it so it will be
able to attack it this is a good example

145
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:40,300
of bad era had a rather better way to
handle errors still not perfect but here

146
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:48,359
I have something that as an idea but I
can try to trick it using a number it

147
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,290
will not return anything ok I will still
try my single court see if I can get it

148
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,760
to talk to me

149
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,560
well it's still changes because as you
can notice I don't have the the table

150
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,680
anymore but it doesn't give me the line
of code that is running or the error as

151
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:15,290
the other one did so this is it can be
considered better error handling things

152
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,569
that we don't normally notice when we
are calling you know what would happen

153
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,990
if the software has an error in it they
can be very important for the attacker

154
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:28,500
and the design of course we share models
with other software and we share models

155
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:36,959
with other networks we don't use safe
data transfer protocols so called

156
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:43,300
something when we are transferring yet
we don't worry doing it and we have

157
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:50,069
problem also managing that is related to
users station and authentication

158
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:55,100
we need to start taking about security
the moment we have the idea of a

159
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,120
software so you can come up with a
brilliant idea for a new mobile

160
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,860
application you know if we still one
million mobile application for 1 Euro

161
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,210
that makes one million euro it's good
business

162
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,890
the moment you have decided you should
start thinking about security that's

163
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:18,260
where it starts and also something that
we forget about this security after the

164
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:24,880
release so once the software is up there
things change because the attacker he

165
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,030
will not carry you know you might be
waiting for a number or an import

166
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:34,420
anything but the attacker he will try or
she will try to give you something else

167
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:40,310
generate an error so that it makes a
mistake so that precious so we need to

168
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,520
be able to understand the attacker this
point of view so if you think you have

169
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,970
put the mirror somewhere the attacker
will find a way to go around so what

170
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:55,080
does he or she need to be able to attack
here or your software it needs an

171
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,200
injection victors so somewhere where she
can send an input just as we have seen a

172
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,930
single coat or a letter and number he
needs an activation zone this is where

173
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:12,780
this input will be handled in his honor
somewhere to send out a cold somewhere

174
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:18,380
just to send their single quarters we
have just seen she will try to

175
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,700
understand what different types of
imports are accepted or rejected so it

176
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:29,360
just now we have seen that numbers we're
OK to some extent but not a single coach

177
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,190
or not and they should produce an
observer will result so if it didn't

178
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,910
change anything when I put the single
coat then I would not be able to tell

179
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,890
that there wasn't a school injection
flow there but since when I put the

180
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,420
single called the table disappeared I
was able to tell that ok something's

181
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:51,229
changing I need somewhere to run the set
that culture

182
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:59,520
can be data base but their team DLL
anything I needed output of course just

183
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:07,550
to understand how it goes and of course
I will need a feedback for example if it

184
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:13,399
was an SQL injection I would needs you
know the information on the table I was

185
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:20,490
trying to attack an exam executable file
I would need a remote shell or something

186
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:29,450
ok let's go over a quick steps off and
that the actress is sometimes closer in

187
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,660
fact close to the what is sometimes
referred us to hiking cycle there's a it

188
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:40,050
starts with target selection and goes
all the way to exploiting I can find the

189
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,990
attacker attempts find that targets many
different ways can scan the network scan

190
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:54,130
the porous or just fathers was just an
example now and find the error but he or

191
00:17:54,130 --> 00:18:01,640
she could exploit and replace the back
door and three sisters this is what we

192
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,880
would expect when we are talking about a
metal detecting and predicting of the

193
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:12,820
application but when we are taking the
executive all files or in any piece of

194
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:18,580
software we need or even with them
application hacking we need to reverse

195
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:23,010
engineering so we need to understand
what the guy who called it was thinking

196
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:28,440
and we have seen that he was thinking
that people can write their names its ok

197
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,120
people can write them a letter its ok
but maybe he didn't think about people

198
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,459
putting a single cold air so we need to
understand how he was thinking and what

199
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,790
he was thinking when he was developing

200
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:51,680
the software and we talked about
security just to have the basics we can

201
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:58,340
say that any obligation is secure if it
only does what he has to do he does

202
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,429
everything it has to do so these are two
criteria if your software full seals

203
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:09,340
those to create areas yes we can say so
secure software but if I can find a way

204
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,980
yesterday we have seen an example about
what code execution so it was supposed

205
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,590
to send pink packets but we were able to
download the file using it so this was

206
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,280
something that he did more than it
should

207
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:29,990
and it should do everything that it
should as I said Sakura development

208
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,060
starts when we first have the idea where
it should start usually it's not it

209
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,500
doesn't work that way that's why we have
all these problems but it should start

210
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:44,460
the moment I have no idea or the moment
I begin my development process and at

211
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,990
that stage I should be able to
understand on my security risks

212
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:55,030
that's how I will Designer software that
will cover risks and even before I come

213
00:19:55,030 --> 00:20:00,129
to secure coding practices not using
Daniel's functions are handling input or

214
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,920
about it sanitizing input all these
things I need also to choose a security

215
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,370
architecture how will I keep my say we
are talking about the application how

216
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:16,389
will I keep it secure where will I put
my controls and then test of course

217
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:22,370
before shipping I'm a penetration
testers so most of the applications I

218
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:27,939
test my test after they have been you
know called it and finished almost some

219
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:34,310
of them after they are being deployed so
when I find a bug or and there it's very

220
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,230
difficult and sometimes almost
impossible to fix them but if I had

221
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:43,200
discovered them at the beginning when it
was just designed or you know between

222
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,180
two of the development it would have
been much easier to go to the source

223
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,950
code and change whatever

224
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:59,139
created the problem will not bore you
with all these things but you know to be

225
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:04,100
able to say that yes we have our at
least trying to have secure coding

226
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:10,299
practices I need to control my inputs I
need to control the user authentication

227
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:15,289
error handling as we have seen you know
for us is just an error just shows that

228
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:19,620
the software is not working or not do
what the user is asking for but the

229
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:24,840
attacker will see it in a different way
and maybe use it to conduct an attack

230
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,209
secure protocols investment management
oldest I have to think about during the

231
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:37,240
cooling ok so why do we have to reverse
engineering way are we trying to

232
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,360
understand how a solution works or how
any piece of software works first of all

233
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:48,350
who might do it just understand say
someone is trying to sell me a firewall

234
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:53,658
just understand if the firewall will do
everything I am expecting first time I

235
00:21:53,659 --> 00:22:00,659
try to reverse engineer it was some
extent if I'm developing say for example

236
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:05,389
a hot piece of hardware for an iPhone
then I would maybe need to reverse

237
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:09,629
engineer some part of that iPhone so
that my component will be integrated and

238
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:15,570
we'll work with that other piece I do it
to discover vulnerabilities this is

239
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:19,970
where the bad guys work they don't care
about developing hardware for iPhone so

240
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,870
obviously and discover under command
attractions everyone knows that there

241
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:29,018
are tons and tons of functions that are
not documented that are used by

242
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:34,240
developers are you know R&D department
but that will not appear in your user

243
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,950
manual for your personal hearing there
are a couple of things we know we are

244
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,000
talking about applications and
application security so when it comes to

245
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,799
reverse engineering maybe there are
things that can help me one of them is

246
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:53,179
source code analysis I could hold up the
cold the source code and try to find

247
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:56,679
tonight to see if there are any
functions but could be dangerous that

248
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:58,990
could lead to a compromise things like
that

249
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:07,580
just to give you an idea want to like
you used to do it is called rats I think

250
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,040
it's wrong

251
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:26,070
auditing tool something something I
forgot the name sorry and just a sec

252
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,480
so I'll just run it on

253
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,840
the clam antivirus and one is using it
or heard about it

254
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:42,080
CLA that's what they think it's decent
piece of antivirus are you using it

255
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:49,199
ok so let's see if there are any things
anything that could be dangerous on the

256
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:59,390
code so this is gonna look at some
scanning on their claims can I have

257
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:12,730
manager that's just because rats is good
with sequels so here is the output its

258
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:20,350
armed some herbal teas that our problems
that he considers higher for example

259
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:25,879
here several lines it's found a fixed
size local buffer so we will just see an

260
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,880
example of a buffer overflow in the way
it can go he thinks that this function

261
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,770
will lead the way it is used will lead
to a buffer overflow and then again the

262
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,240
sprintf you know he tells me that to
make sure that the argument that this

263
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,650
post with dysfunction xoxoxoxo just by
looking at the source code without even

264
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:53,960
trying to work on the executable
reverse-engineered executive will I can

265
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,290
just get the source code and see if
anything goes wrong or anything is a bit

266
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:04,210
risky

267
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:09,870
I said that we its 2015 and we still
cannot write in a decent piece of

268
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:16,070
software the main reason is that the
industry as such is not a real industry

269
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,870
on myself because if we go with the
example of fridges we bought a fridge

270
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:27,199
will become home to play it it doesn't
work so what do you take it back you

271
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,060
don't you know maybe open the door
closed its if it starts working or

272
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:37,330
because you know what we buy software
and it crashes we're about it and

273
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,550
everything goes to normal

274
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:43,950
we don't take back the subway the
windows of them this year crashed please

275
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,910
take it back and give me one that
doesn't crush we cannot say this so this

276
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:52,310
is an if you read this warranty software
in his you will see that most of the

277
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:57,980
time there are none so that's one of the
problem and the manufacturer doesn't

278
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,630
take any responsibility

279
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:04,250
the case and we don't have anyone that
checks for software for example if

280
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:08,300
there's a plane accident there people to
start looking into it so why did it

281
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,010
happen how did it happen what can we do
so that it doesn't happen again but when

282
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:17,320
your Windows crashes no one comes to
your home in checks this this is one of

283
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,659
the reasons that everything is so
difficult just an overview of the

284
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,930
software development cycle yeah we need
some requirements so we said that we are

285
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:30,020
going to develop a mobile application
will sell one million of them for 10

286
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,540
each other it will be our first million
so we will have some requirements there

287
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:37,389
and then we will design it will design
how it works well designed a user

288
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:42,860
interface will start holding it and then
testing it and deploying get hopefully

289
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:50,840
waiting four million euros the ones in
yellow are the steps in which we include

290
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,550
vulnerable so if we don't make any
mistakes on these three steps then we

291
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:03,760
are sure that interesting and deploy
deployment will be almost ok so these

292
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,140
are the three most critical steps for us

293
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:14,480
talked about funding funding is
basically throwing a lot of information

294
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,770
to the software and hoping it crashes
are gives a number but that is not

295
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:26,700
expected so we can work on and there are
several reasons I do it just as it may

296
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,510
be to find a target so I just downloaded
an executable files on the internet I

297
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:39,580
start closing it see if it's exploitable
are not just to play around but for the

298
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,490
following process I just need the
executable as I said or anything I can

299
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:50,630
for finding put fields so where can I
send inputs that I started the process

300
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:54,400
what will I sent again

301
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:00,620
important start rising forcing it
depends on what you are working against

302
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:07,149
this can take just a few guns or it can
take days or maybe weeks observe the

303
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,960
results and see if I can find anything

304
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:16,680
exploitable buffer overflows are easy to
understand that's why you know as i

305
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,720
understood them I'm sure everyone
understands them so I have no eight

306
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,510
letters and I'm trying to string copy
them using the function string coping

307
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:32,450
see I'm coping them to a buffer with a
place for size in the normal life I

308
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:37,450
would expect it you know just to rights
life and drop the other three white this

309
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:42,710
is what I would expect because it has no
room for it but what happens is that it

310
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:50,020
accepts the other three twice time
somewhere so we as attack and what we

311
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:59,920
need to do is find which is and where he
writes them so why do you not have any

312
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:05,270
buffer control or that's too much before
control in happens you use functions

313
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:12,530
that do not that a low before or flow
and secure practices so that's why we

314
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,990
find them almost

315
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:21,820
everywhere and if so how do we exploited
we find the buffer of those who will

316
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:30,409
find the place where it crushes we send
exploit and we hope everything works so

317
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,860
how do we find longer with any piece of
software

318
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:43,428
anyone working on this year finding
vulnerabilities hunting bogus so you can

319
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:47,929
start working on it it's very easy all
you have to do is used you know these

320
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:52,370
are open free solutions some of them
open source home server was developed

321
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:57,159
specially for this situation so that you
can download it it's an executable file

322
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:04,130
it has one day lol so it helps you learn
things you mean to bug is a bug was

323
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:09,220
going we're going to see and of course
by them which is my favorite line which

324
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:18,160
this is what it looks like so you have
your assembly called registers stake in

325
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:28,740
TX we can just think it will be much
better

326
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:35,350
so windows in Turkish but I think we'll
be able to understand each other this is

327
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:43,889
one server it's not very impressive just
say it is waiting for client connections

328
00:30:43,890 --> 00:31:07,320
it it's listening on port 9999 I'm going
to tacit using

329
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:49,320
just

330
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,639
HELP for help

331
00:31:54,639 --> 00:32:01,258
lists all the functions the one we are
trying to will try to use his truck and

332
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:10,460
doesn't do anything but you just you can
just send it a bunch of aids it just

333
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:16,350
does whatever anything so what I'm going
to try to do is see if I can get this

334
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:23,709
one server to question it has seen my
connection so let's see if I can get it

335
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:30,220
to crash I couldn't do this manually in
a rights all the A's in the world I

336
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:46,129
could but it would not be very feasible
so I just wrote this and what it does it

337
00:32:46,129 --> 00:33:00,320
ask me for a number and it sends that
number of faith over

338
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:08,230
attack a 1000 trying complete goodbye it
it didn't crash so let's see if I can

339
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:24,610
get it doesn't ok I don't get any reply
here and yeah it it crashed now I know

340
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:28,678
that there's a problem but I'm really
not sure what the problem exactly so to

341
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:37,179
be able to understand the problem I have
to run I will also need my debugger

342
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:43,549
that's where the debugger comes in so it
will tell me what went wrong and why it

343
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:58,879
went from it

344
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:06,150
so for now there is nothing on the
screen goes it's not attached to

345
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:12,860
anything I will just attach it to my own
server process so that it will populate

346
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:20,580
the screen with anything that is related
to the service so as an attacker I will

347
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,110
not bore you with all the details but
what is important for me is this this is

348
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:30,300
the place where the next comment that
will be executed is so if I can change

349
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,139
this it means that the next comment that
this woman server will do is whatever

350
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:41,010
I'm sending so this is what I'm trying
to do see if I can make it crash again

351
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:54,909
now it's just run it

352
00:34:54,909 --> 00:35:32,450
bear pictures

353
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:38,299
so what is good with the demos that you
can see what is going on with his bed is

354
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:55,400
it was just time they feel so sorry
about that

355
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:13,420
you know what I will do my machine is
trying to make it crash again so we know

356
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:26,420
that a 2008 crashed so let's see what
really happened when it crashed yes

357
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:34,240
here I can see that in fact that's
important for us it says that it has an

358
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:42,348
access violation when you try to write
to 41 41 41 41 so going back to the

359
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:52,599
morning presentation this was recorded I
sent and it crushed saying but it have

360
00:36:52,599 --> 00:37:06,410
problems trying to write to this address
and for those who know 41 is so that the

361
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:13,339
A's I sent him some of them the phone
server software thought that there were

362
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:17,578
a place in the memory to write something
and it crashed trying to right there

363
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:22,309
it's interesting but it's not
exploitable why it might be exploitable

364
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:28,119
of course but if it took this one of the
aids are some of the A's as an

365
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,920
instruction and the next comment to be
executed that would have been much more

366
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:39,859
interesting for us and i was just period
they're going off the demo one smart if

367
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:45,819
I sent three thousand days then yes now
I have a crush saying that it failed

368
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:53,509
trying to execute those A's so ok I know
that somewhere between 2000 and 2003

369
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:57,250
thousand there are a bunch of aids that

370
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:05,300
application things are commands to be
executed so if I can just find the place

371
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:10,500
where this would happen it would be easy
for me to stand on my comment so how do

372
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:20,440
I do that I create a piece of text that
doesn't repeat itself so every four by

373
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:29,690
see our unique so that I know why it
failed I just put it in my face the same

374
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:34,390
basically as the father but instead of
sending lots of aids or as many as I

375
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:43,040
want its first since one thousand pages
and then this unique characters yes it

376
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:54,430
crushes and we see that it crashed
trying to execute this you will ever you

377
00:38:54,430 --> 00:39:01,180
know the king that wanted his people to
break eczema certain way begin in little

378
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,210
endian

379
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:10,640
because Intel processors are called
Little Indians this in fact is this the

380
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,830
way they were I think the memory so they
were starting from the end and here are

381
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:24,549
our major this is the major place so
whatever I put here it will be accepted

382
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:32,000
as a command to be executed and the
location is at 1006 bites from the

383
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:40,060
beginning so what I need to do now is
just send our 1000 days and and then

384
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:48,060
1600 bite so at the 2006 by its whatever
I put there will be executed try if it

385
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:55,870
works I just put my name here and you
can see yes that's the place I should

386
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:04,240
check that the problem with developing
the exploit is that there are some

387
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,640
characters I will not be able to use
because the software or you know

388
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:15,589
whatever is that interprets software
will think these are comments for him

389
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:19,770
and we'll do something so just to be
able to understand is there any

390
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:25,330
character isn't that strange that
starting from zero going to 256 which

391
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:31,180
are all the characters we can computer

392
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:50,509
I will just send you my initial 2006
characters then I will send all the

393
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:56,730
characters I can and then I will you
know finished arrest because I need in

394
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:00,550
fact retailers and characters to make
this exploit work so it's less than 2000

395
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:05,819
it will not be the same crash my
exploitable piece of

396
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:10,430
memory will not be the same location etc
etc so I need exactly three dozen what I

397
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:17,759
tell it is OK send 2006 10 my what I
want to be executed and then all the

398
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:25,890
characters again and for the rest just
put a bunch of deaths at the 2000 when I

399
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:34,769
run it I see that s don't arrive are not
executed are not accepted so one of the

400
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:40,848
characters between amongst this was a
bad character was something that made to

401
00:41:40,849 --> 00:41:47,640
exploit failed it didn't work so this is
a bit tricky it might take some time are

402
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,359
sometimes you might get lucky so now
instead of starting at zero I started

403
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,589
one of the first character don't use it

404
00:41:54,589 --> 00:41:59,069
see if the rest is good I run it yet now
I see that ebbs and all the other

405
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:07,009
characters reach the memory so it's ok
though but character in fact was the

406
00:42:07,009 --> 00:42:16,469
first one so now that I know that
something what I can change and where I

407
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:22,410
can find this thing I can change I need
a comment to put their writing my name

408
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:27,598
is called but it will not pay the bill
so as a hacker I need something that

409
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,079
will help me pay the bills a virus are
backed or something like that and four

410
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:40,900
days I can use several compliments I can
find the comment inside the executable

411
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,339
file can use one of the DL else that

412
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:53,019
comes with the software here it's had on
for today and it will list everything

413
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:58,479
that this executable is using these are
things that I don't notice so even the

414
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:06,089
Windows kernel should be listed there
and it also shows lol why would that be

415
00:43:06,089 --> 00:43:11,609
important for me because in in order to
be able to make my exploit run on every

416
00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:18,558
machine I need you know we know the
exact place after address its 2006 bites

417
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:25,039
and now I need a comment to put there
and I need to make sure that the place

418
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:30,440
after comment doesn't change when the
machine change so how do they do it

419
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:38,390
normally they use it was address space
location randomization something like

420
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:43,960
that so that every time I start the DL
or executable the place changes so this

421
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:53,499
is in fact the security function I see
that two components that help me run

422
00:43:53,499 --> 00:43:56,910
this application don't use it or not
allowed

423
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:03,078
so there is a large as false one of them
is the executable itself and the other

424
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:13,299
one is a dealer it's using I cannot use
this one because you know it starts with

425
00:44:13,299 --> 00:44:19,530
double zero and I said that just seemed
that no bite was not working with my

426
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:25,690
with dishonorable key so i cant use it
the only one I can use as this one

427
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:34,680
ok so now I need to find a jump so
because what I will do is as I know

428
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,810
where I have to put the next comments to
be executed our put a jump there and I

429
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:42,410
will make it jumped my own exploit so
that I can exploit the application

430
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:49,420
inside this DLL I find like nine or ten
jump functions are you can you just

431
00:44:49,420 --> 00:45:01,460
might exploit I will use you know which
used to be a massive payloads and I miss

432
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:06,060
having called now they have put it
together just it will open me or give me

433
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:13,509
a river shell this is just may be an
important point I asked not to use the

434
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,310
non-white because it's about character
should I put it in the exploit it will

435
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:21,509
correct it will not work so I just get
elected not to use it but the rest is

436
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:27,250
just open your oversell this is my
localhost and on this part so it

437
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:35,320
generates the payload just lets me go
over it

438
00:45:35,320 --> 00:46:06,640
again if I fail in another application
for grant of more

439
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:15,859
because I am asking it to open over
she'll start listening on that port

440
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:32,070
exploit again this the same piece of
code it will send 2006 A's then the

441
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:38,510
location of the jump function I found
because I wanted to go there and instead

442
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:44,940
of putting all these F again I'll just
put the payload I just generate really

443
00:46:44,940 --> 00:47:31,079
simple as just need to change this works

444
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:45,119
because that's exactly what we needed
and see what happens with listener it

445
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:56,969
was listening it cut what you might call
Michelle so now I'm inside the Windows

446
00:47:56,969 --> 00:48:04,090
machine

447
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:11,000
that's basically I was just to go over
the process once more with the slides

448
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:28,610
may be to make sure everything is ok
because we had to go back and forth

449
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:35,260
this was my father you know just try to
make the program crash or you know make

450
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:43,720
sure the program gave me an error I run
it a few times and i've seen it first

451
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:49,029
crash that 2000 but it was not very
usable because whatever input I was

452
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:53,180
sending it thought that it was something
to write on so it wasn't very

453
00:48:53,180 --> 00:49:00,089
exploitable I treat thousands crashed
and this time it was ok my command was

454
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:06,590
accepted as such as a comment I just
needed a string of characters that were

455
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:13,960
not repeating so that I could you know
they are loved and look at my expert I

456
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:21,560
did this send it over the location and
because it was began in the lending all

457
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:28,440
these good things this was my location
so that I knew that whatever I sent

458
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:36,630
after this first 2006 bites would be
accepted as a comment just to make sure

459
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:41,460
I double check yes it is accepted as a
comment there are some bad characters

460
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:46,030
that will that we should avoid because
it might be no terminate the strength or

461
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:53,270
the line so just a testament sending all
the characters there in the world

462
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:56,650
yes one of them makes that this is not
working

463
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:03,300
something goes wrong now I send the
remaining I start one-by-one eliminating

464
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,140
the characters until I find a good one

465
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:14,040
unlike in this case it's no bite yes it
works it's ok I'm using the money for

466
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:19,360
anything just to find the location or
you know

467
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:25,300
other executable I can use to develop to
build an exploit it gives me two

468
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,330
possibilities of the first one is the
executive itself and the other one is

469
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:34,850
the dealer it is running because of the
address of the executable I cannot use

470
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:38,710
it as an old Italian restaurant will
create a whole bunch of problems I

471
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:45,940
decide to use the yellow and neither job
function again using one up I find a

472
00:50:45,940 --> 00:51:00,380
jump from inside the 11 I use any of
them to help from a massive to build up

473
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:08,650
a load so the payload is basically for
Windows Server shell on TCP my localhost

474
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:13,420
address my local partners on this is the
parts it will connect back to I asked

475
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:21,620
him not to use on all night and some
encoding and for the output format has

476
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:29,140
had to put them so this is what it
generated I start my listener on my

477
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:37,410
machine and once I send the payload
everything's back to normal

478
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:46,049
you'll notice that in the last case the
software didn't crush on the machine

479
00:51:46,050 --> 00:52:04,460
connected to it but voluntarily still
working so nothing crashed

480
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:11,619
so this is more or less the process and
all the idea behind it if you have any

481
00:52:11,619 --> 00:52:34,190
questions I can try to answer number

482
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:47,390
whatever the Windows machine is one he
be able to see our IP address or IP

483
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:53,350
address he sending yes in this case it
will attest sinar as you can see it has

484
00:52:53,350 --> 00:53:00,490
seen our connection that does received
the connection so it will be they will

485
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:08,839
be able to see who contacted this is an
early stage usually this is not how it

486
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:12,390
where it I will stop you know if this
was a real company and it was a real

487
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:17,839
attack once I got this position I would
use the Windows machine to get a better

488
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:23,790
back door remote access Trojan because
you know someone just came close this

489
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:28,000
application or just they can just shut
down their computers and go home so it's

490
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,820
it's not very usable in real life so I
need to move laterally or a No

491
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:40,220
somewhere else it will I will leave a
trace year of business but I can then go

492
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:51,919
back and delete it but in the first
contact us and we will leave this

493
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,760
thank you very much
