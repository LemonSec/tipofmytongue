1
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,500
ok let's start welcome to the balkan 215

2
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,890
their guests Pickering welcome to our
congress in north side this year we have

3
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:39,780
lectures about amateur radio Association
of wi-fi traffic security on the

4
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,579
networks and other things

5
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:48,659
special extent I want to put on
workshops that will have it tomorrow

6
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:56,170
workshops for journalists and 11 ish
game a workshop we have a special guests

7
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:01,229
from the Bible in that have that should
make its crippled party London time to

8
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,830
make it either

9
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:10,080
guests and this year we want to share
with all new knowledge to repeat that we

10
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:25,158
all knew so far and I want to say
welcome to you and let stand again

11
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:55,530
how many actually expecting and how many
of you actually heard about mass also

12
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:06,719
expected and I will give the later point
on this list all will be what mimi is

13
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,478
what we are doing

14
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:17,049
and about preservation of software and
how we should how we can all help

15
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:31,860
improving that well first what may be
his machine emulator but that is the

16
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,989
initial name of the project

17
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:43,920
lately we did some changes how we do
things and we cooperated the sister

18
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,940
project called mass inside the project
was started by Nicholas all Maurya in

19
00:02:51,940 --> 00:03:02,440
Europe and it was actually running first
one game then five games and right now

20
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:13,569
we are about 30,000 games actually
playing against maybe I'll just sick

21
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:34,929
project and it is basically a regulation
of computers and consoles and that is

22
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:43,470
the thing that was not so important in
the past because he had less developers

23
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,139
working on it and it was not so popular
among the people as we can see also by

24
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,870
the recognition of the name itself and
the problem wars

25
00:03:53,870 --> 00:04:02,280
well first name mass you know English
you know what it tells you and but that

26
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,879
was not the problem but the problem was
that there was a small amount of people

27
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,670
working hard on really soon

28
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:21,659
popular it was not so well advertised
and after all it's it was not easy to

29
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,360
put those kind of things just kind of
relations inside the arcade cabinet and

30
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:35,250
play game for free which was obviously
not our intention

31
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:41,860
next thing I would like to talk is why
the preservation of software is so

32
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,310
important

33
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:52,740
first of all the most of the computer
companies producing software basically

34
00:04:52,740 --> 00:05:03,139
do not see hold all the versions of
their software and that is really real

35
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:11,110
real real thing but actually even the
big big companies that produced games

36
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:17,840
actually never had to go to database or
the software itself and you read the

37
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:27,020
time some of them like Williams for
example gave the Rams to public but

38
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:32,880
those rooms were just the latest
versions of their software because they

39
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,009
just added those databases just the last
one and not the previous versions

40
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:45,559
and is to prevent problems like this

41
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:53,749
also things just get lost you know the
problems could be some backup systems

42
00:05:53,749 --> 00:06:02,389
trailers and various other things struck
the data storages and we just had the

43
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:08,619
last of of some important software as a
Service the storage medium sir just

44
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:17,949
unreliable and the problem is that sort
of past were stored on cassettes also on

45
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:26,169
flop is which have a limited time so
basically after some time you just lost

46
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:36,188
during the democratization of the medium
you just lost date on it and also when

47
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:47,229
we look at what is saved in form of any
any means of saving like making a backup

48
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:54,120
copies on the internet you basically
have just the good stuff so you are

49
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:01,550
limited to preservation of the software
which is just well known and well done

50
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:08,139
and it is not up to us to decide what
should be saved and what should not be

51
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:19,159
next thing will be how we actually do
that from the side of Main project we

52
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:28,188
use the source code as a document so
basically our souls our source code name

53
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:36,819
is done in C++ and you actually have the
parts of code which contains just the

54
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:38,400
CFCs

55
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:48,479
a city one of the files from files from
the original games or from the original

56
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:55,650
flavors of various computers soared
eight games why this is important thing

57
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:03,929
is that source code does not have
anything is legally owned by any other

58
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:12,710
company so basically it is safe to store
data is a part of the source code also

59
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:20,229
you are you have the one police on which
you can actually check if some of the

60
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:27,909
dams is valid or not and we have a tool
inside our project that can loop through

61
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:36,849
all the rooms and check if one of
Europe's is available in our database

62
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:44,070
the second thing we knew from about two
years in the past is XML software

63
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:51,209
database be called its soft lists and
those actually are basically the same

64
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:57,959
thing but made in an external is
extraordinary moments in which we have

65
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:09,750
listed software in a form of list of for
example floppies and you have also very

66
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:17,800
active grouping of those so for example
you have some games that are distributed

67
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,500
on five

68
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:27,790
floppies so you have all of them listed
and with their sizes and in Searcy so

69
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:37,660
you can actually check if those are real
good amps think that we are now store is

70
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,420
actually the best available damn of
existing software why this is important

71
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:51,939
thing is that for example you have you
can find some floppy disk containing

72
00:09:51,940 --> 00:10:01,260
copy of of one computer game and you
make a copy of that during its not

73
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:07,500
original medium but still it's that game
you know and you have a copy of it so

74
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,110
that is best what you have in that
moment but during the time you find the

75
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:20,640
regional medium and what we do is then
made a regional medium damp and during

76
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,120
the time all the databases cleared but
we never get lost those deter rarely

77
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,360
available so it's it's always good to
have at least some version if you can't

78
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,950
have the original one of course if
you're trying to push all the

79
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:47,480
contributors just to give us the
regional from original medium

80
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,790
and stomped on their own diversified
methods which is most important for

81
00:10:53,790 --> 00:11:01,089
example for floppies and that's next
point so basically floppies or

82
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:07,570
characteristic because they are just you
know changes of magnetic flux nothing

83
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:17,170
else but the thing is that some of the
flood protection is based exactly on

84
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:26,779
some changes that are based on the speed
of your velocity of changing the they

85
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:34,269
had over the by reading the data so you
can get into position that you actually

86
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:43,850
can transfer after because you're not
emulating properly that that media y

87
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:52,790
relation is important first we're trying
to preserve documents and software and

88
00:11:52,790 --> 00:12:00,839
we try to do that without any change on
the phone that software or death

89
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:08,410
documents that we are able to to
preserve some older software and cables

90
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:14,620
are able to show you how it how it
worked in the past on the modern devices

91
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:24,260
subir using actually latest technology
to execute the old code also we are

92
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:30,949
using the modern storage for the old
software so all the cassettes are

93
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:38,290
basically now stored in a digital form
so we don't have a problem of like we

94
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:45,420
had before using me what is actually for

95
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:53,329
and who shoot actually use it well first
thing that everybody thinks it is for is

96
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,970
for playing games

97
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:01,410
well it's not just that I mean we
started as a arcade emulator and that

98
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:11,680
was your 9718 years ago so it was a long
time ago and and basically our goal now

99
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:18,239
is to to try to change that one of the
important things that happened meanwhile

100
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:28,500
boys emerged between ms so what that
gives it gave us is basically be

101
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:35,130
involved in development for computers
and for consoles into the world of me

102
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:44,350
was always just as a sister project of
May so basically what we did is that we

103
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:53,000
use the the source code of man as the
start point and then just add you

104
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,310
devices emulation and the support for
reading concerts and four peas and so on

105
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:09,670
one of the most powerful things inside
the main is its debugger the burglaries

106
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:18,150
is very useful since you can basically
develop and see how things are working

107
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:26,480
on actual machine from the past by
executing get you can change code you

108
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:33,230
can change the eight areas basically do
you have sent box in which you can you

109
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,340
can play with the old computers and
software for it I can give you an

110
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:48,290
example of that we are actually right
now able to run Windows 2000 the main so

111
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,520
on the

112
00:14:50,520 --> 00:15:06,170
processors so basically you reached that
level of emulation but also what is

113
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:15,469
important is that our goal is for me to
be used in the development of some new

114
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:23,760
hardware and to use it as a development
to creating new hardware that actually

115
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:31,970
does not exist because for example we
have eighty course for CPUs and also a

116
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:37,990
lot of other sound course with you
course so basically you can easily take

117
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:44,160
all of that create some virtual machine
that doesn't exist and write software

118
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,990
for it and then you can basically build
it afterwards

119
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:55,970
important thing that happened that is
going to happen but it's it's still in

120
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:05,160
the works is going open source name was
always source available so for all these

121
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,889
years he always gave our source to
people

122
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:19,559
and it was free to download and the main
problem why it was not open source is

123
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:27,410
that there was misuse of some other
companies and persons that thought it

124
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:35,779
was really good to make money off of it
and basically think that they did is the

125
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:44,799
debil arcade cabinets and then these old
those arcade cabinets with me inside and

126
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,449
also they used the name of the main
which is trademark and that's why we

127
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:58,339
need to register that trademark in order
to prevent this kind of problem and the

128
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:03,959
main problem is that basically after
that we were those that were having a

129
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:09,569
problem because of their misuse because
companies were sending complains to US

130
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:15,829
thinking that we are actually you know
because we created the emulator but

131
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:23,500
legally there were no problems first
thing that we did is that we used ESPN

132
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:32,370
and first thing that we did we did we
join too as finance one was named ESPN

133
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:40,379
which was private and the other was mess
which was public during that time and we

134
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:47,549
emerged that created that first as a
public repo and then after that we

135
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:52,210
decided to move to the Kitab and that
was really good

136
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:58,950
an important step because that is how we
gained more people to work with

137
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:06,320
our software and the good thing is that
actually what we did is that we open

138
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:13,560
ourselves to community and said okay
maybe is there but we are open and that

139
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:19,190
you can contribute is it to us and to be
honest it's really save us a lot of time

140
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:26,310
for the emerging called the additional
things that people are sending to us

141
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:38,600
thing is that has its own license in the
past and its modified BSD tree license

142
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:46,870
and that only change that actually is
there is that we are basically you can

143
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:54,790
you know you reuse code you can without
any consequences but actually you can't

144
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:59,690
use it for the commercial purposes you
can't sell that and that's the the

145
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:05,130
restriction which is not recognized by
your side and that's the reason why

146
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:13,280
you're actually moving to the new
license since there is really large

147
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:20,460
number of contributors and we still a
need need away somehow to protect their

148
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:29,880
rights their code thing that I proposed
was those it is three licenses most of

149
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:36,950
the code right now we are somewhere
about 96% of coverage of code that is

150
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:43,080
licensed boot because we needed to
contact each and every contributor from

151
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,760
the last 18 years and that's a hell of a
job so it's not that easy

152
00:19:49,760 --> 00:20:00,890
and 1998 96% of court is not covered
with the licenses and about I think it's

153
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:08,370
about 84 percent of current code is be
as the tree and this is really important

154
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:14,479
because this really gives a full freedom
of usage of our code and what is most

155
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:23,340
important is that it is basically core
of the project is be as the tree and

156
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:31,060
that makes things easier for any future
use and the GPL two outs appeal to are

157
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:40,540
mostly code is emulation of specific
computers or arcades so because there

158
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,379
are some things that people really spent
a lot of money and effort in the past

159
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:53,620
and they want to protect that in some
way just at least to be able to get a

160
00:20:53,620 --> 00:21:00,389
call back from whoever using it

161
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:10,030
one important thing is that why we did
move to the open source is that actually

162
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:15,639
good thing for us would be usage of
other open source libraries

163
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:22,570
and then we will be compatible when we
are also the open-source fully and also

164
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:32,399
there are a lot of companies that are
actually giving their tools for free to

165
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,810
all developers that are producing open
source software which is sometimes

166
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:42,040
really important for us especially for
some profiling and things like that

167
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:54,040
what also this should improve is making
things easier for academic usage and

168
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:01,060
historic preservation we have a lot of
contact with people in past the task can

169
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:08,669
be use for example main inside museums
to show things they actually own there

170
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:18,530
so in some countries when you own your
own computer you can you can take its

171
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:24,149
wrong read the content and use it on the
on the emulator and that would be

172
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,350
illegal because you own the real machine
as well

173
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:34,330
some countries that's not the case but
it was the time it is and basically they

174
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:39,879
couldn't do that because their museum
and they're actually you actually need

175
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,080
to pay to come inside the museum and
that would be commercial use

176
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,909
even if we agree on that they could have
a problem and this should at least sold

177
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:58,410
some some issues like this so we are
really happy if their museums or schools

178
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,440
using good name as a tool for

179
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:10,009
learn again showing somethings also what
we want to do is to let illegal owners

180
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:17,789
of the rights for specific games or
wrongs of course some specific software

181
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:28,759
to be able to use my name is a platform
so basically no we are not going to

182
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:31,620
always be open

183
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:41,219
always be free for use but we'll just
let the other companies that owned the

184
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:47,929
rights for the specific aim to use the
main has a core and to create a

185
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:58,350
basically emulator that will run that
game as will be the main course I will

186
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:05,519
it do a little talk about maintaining go
of such a big project as there are

187
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:13,169
currently 52 active developers it's big
and it's not that big

188
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:21,460
when you say see that there is 200
megabytes of your source code so that is

189
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:29,159
just C plus C C++ code nothing else
there is additional 60 megabytes of

190
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:37,409
expects about software definitions about
basically it's a it's a real large coat

191
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,120
babies

192
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,739
and during the past years labor for
example of five years ago

193
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:53,890
most of the cold was pure see and now
everything is in C++ it was a transition

194
00:24:53,890 --> 00:25:02,690
that took a long time but if you keep in
mind about how large the project is and

195
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:07,880
that people are only working in their
spare time it really takes a lot of

196
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,179
effort to put into to transfer
everything and and the thing is that for

197
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:20,500
example even on the the high-end
computers city takes you at least 15

198
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,630
minutes to compile all from scratch so
you're talking about

199
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:32,550
almost five gigahertz CPUs and you know
and the thing is that it's it's it's a

200
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:40,600
process it takes a while but we're
trying to do that point so improvement

201
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:49,959
well as I said this project is not done
and will never be done actually that's

202
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,750
good thing and that's also bad thing

203
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:58,270
good thing is because we are actually
always improving ourselves in trying to

204
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,300
do more and more and more inside

205
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:10,669
PCR mistakes from the past and we tried
to to improve that somehow the worst

206
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:18,460
thing he actually have is you are we
were never very much user-friendly and

207
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:24,980
that's the problem with most of the
users we have that it's not easy to use

208
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:34,679
that is becoming more and more harder to
use but you know I was always developer

209
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:39,120
developer friendly and every user
friendly and we are trying to change

210
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:51,090
that we are also good cooperation with
the outer of gfx and

211
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:58,080
trying to use that graphic library and
to use it in our system and to me

212
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:05,419
because it's a it's a good starting
point for us and I personally think it

213
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:12,200
will be good for the future of the
project also point of recruitment will

214
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:20,200
be processed communication so what is
the idea you were actually emulating for

215
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:27,090
example PC computer but you would like
to have another PC computer and to make

216
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:33,709
them talk to each other so that's that's
our goal busy could do have multiple

217
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:41,660
machines running on your computer and be
able to talk to each other right now we

218
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:48,740
can do that the network layer so
basically we have for example ambulation

219
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:56,420
of all the Mac computers from Motorola
and they're able to use the network

220
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:04,420
cards and able to use the internet from
today and you can actually browse using

221
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:12,330
the browser from the less of a computer
and that's that's kind of interesting

222
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,750
thing because you you could actually try
some things from the past you were not

223
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:23,010
able because they are things like fax
machines and there were ppl Evans and

224
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:29,020
things like that are trying to get into
maim and bass and made basically make it

225
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:38,940
available for people to try out also as
I mentioned be GFX is is is our way I

226
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:45,120
think out to use the 3d acceleration of
available harder because there are a lot

227
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:52,870
of our kids that are actually made with
treaty harder

228
00:28:52,870 --> 00:29:01,879
and also we have things like
Photographics that is that was not very

229
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:11,210
good for its time and basically our idea
is to use existing 3d capable

230
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:17,410
capabilities in order to make this
happened and to be much faster in to use

231
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:29,130
that when we have that available next
thing is exposing all who were using

232
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:40,250
language that I believe you probably a
lot of you guys heard about it and it's

233
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:45,480
really it's it's a simple language easy
to incorporate it cooperated with this

234
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:55,050
in C++ and basically idea is to expose
as much as we can from the core so

235
00:29:55,050 --> 00:30:02,450
basically you can create the plugins and
somebody stole things deliberation and

236
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:10,510
make it more usable for example people
are always trying to use some cheats and

237
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:17,470
things like that and also high scores
that was think that was removed from the

238
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:23,000
main time ago and reason why it was
removed because the real machine didn't

239
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:30,870
save high scores so immigration should
not save the high scores as well and i

240
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:37,010
think is that you can actually wait this
kind of scripting you can make a script

241
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:43,290
that will actually do the same for you
just on the on the close of the machine

242
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:48,710
it will just go and save the specific
parts of memory on the phone for a while

243
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:57,240
and you will have your high score said
about the goals for the future

244
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:05,480
main goal is to create a main core as a
universal platform for emulation so

245
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,500
basically two to make it

246
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:16,060
defacto standard for emulation and to
make more people and more companies to

247
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:25,419
use it as it is a start up on my next
personal goal is to finish licensing

248
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:35,050
process it's a process that actually
took me about a month to reach some

249
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:40,590
initial state in which we have a lot of
takes cover but somethings some people

250
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:47,290
are actually really hard to find and
that's basically the problem we can't go

251
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:52,980
without at least trying to contact each
and every contributor for past from past

252
00:31:52,980 --> 00:32:00,310
and that's time-consuming wanting that
we actually would like to see is our

253
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:05,659
official mobile version and we know that
there are a lot of mobile versions of

254
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:13,520
Maine but those were basically based on
the code that we produced beginning of

255
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:22,690
2000 year 2000 so you actually have
about at least 10 years lost of

256
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:29,730
development and that's not what was done
during that time that was to be that is

257
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:37,820
what we would like to change also we
would like to add whatever is left to be

258
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:46,620
emulated and that's not a small amount
of things definitely we started with you

259
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,939
know when I started working on project I
i noticed for example that there are no

260
00:32:51,940 --> 00:33:00,429
computers from this reason at all so I
try and that one by one

261
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:05,740
and after a year then I noticed there
there were a lot of Eastern European

262
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:12,700
computers at least it it will not
available and i also then start to

263
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:19,919
adding them I tried to contact some
Russian developers developers from east

264
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:26,830
germany execuse Germany and they were
really helpful they they sent us wrong

265
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:34,070
cindy's sent this version of emulators
and help us fix some issues and actually

266
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:41,269
during the time we did you know hundreds
of machines that were just never never

267
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:49,909
end of interest for divestment people
but after some time you see that there

268
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:55,090
was just you know those machines were
really interesting for four people for

269
00:33:55,090 --> 00:34:00,178
example everyone wants to see how the
first the first machine that runs the

270
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:05,429
Tetris looked liked and what's that
machine how it booted how it worked you

271
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:11,309
know you just want to don't know how it
looked and that is what we actually try

272
00:34:11,309 --> 00:34:19,309
to do so there is always something to be
emulated and I hope we will get more

273
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:28,510
contributions during the time yeah I
think I'm almost at the end of my time

274
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:39,460
so I would like to ask you if there is
some questions

275
00:34:39,460 --> 00:35:27,780
chili and I'm very happy about it too
much to ask is do you have any

276
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:33,570
corporation cry of flux people they made

277
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:42,960
device to this and other question is do
you have cooperation with other people

278
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:50,380
who were specific for the machines yeah
well I started the second one so

279
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:56,180
actually be to have cooperation with
people working on other emulators and

280
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:03,569
during the time we were known as bored
emulator because we assimilate

281
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:11,270
everything that we find but basically it
was not that's true but i think is that

282
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:18,120
what is different between me and the
other emulators is that we actually have

283
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:23,630
a goal to emulate everything you know
and all of those other projects have a

284
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:30,860
goal to emulate just specific machines
or just from the specific manufacturer

285
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:36,530
for example and thing is that when they
are finished they're finished and there

286
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:42,290
is nothing to improve those projects
basically our most of those projects

287
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:49,670
have even better capabilities in some
places then the name and the reason is

288
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:55,090
that they can basically optimize their
work because they're doing one thing

289
00:36:55,090 --> 00:37:01,110
we're trying to generalize that and
that's that is a problem but it is also

290
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:05,980
good thing because you have so we have
two cute

291
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:15,350
communications with with a lot of hours
for example for the outer off $1 a litre

292
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:22,740
also from the Essex outer and we have
communications also be tighter I have

293
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:28,390
the good communication with some Russian
developers everyone of every of us here

294
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:34,368
the communication with some of the
people think about crime flocks and the

295
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:41,160
the other ways of preserving the the
media will think is the date capped

296
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:47,779
their format closed and that was our
biggest problem we could create the

297
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:58,660
image of media but we didn't have not
able to read it because they just have a

298
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:04,240
deal our providers just anything to
reason that was not enough for us

299
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:10,330
because you're actually multi-platform
project so we need to work on Linux and

300
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:17,630
or six as well and things that happened
is that basically one of our guys do to

301
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:21,320
reverse engineering Golf Hall

302
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:29,020
their their streams basically he
documented everything put that on line

303
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:33,890
and the day after day put their
documentation online with the full

304
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:38,220
description of everything they were
messing but they were just from the

305
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:43,830
different outdoors so basically they
were taking over opening themselves but

306
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:53,580
it was just a moment of decision so
basically the end we have the drive like

307
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,460
sport

308
00:38:54,460 --> 00:39:05,330
thank you

309
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:30,290
exchanged a few messages with him
afterwards and I see dead end it's it's

310
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:37,310
really good thing that there are
actually people to promote our soft her

311
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:44,609
the world because i think is that most
of the people who see it as a brain how

312
00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:52,750
to play free games which is not our
intention and basically idea is using it

313
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:59,430
for something totally different and for
example we have the contribution that

314
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:04,330
expanded our Lewis report and the good
thing there is that basically the guy

315
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:11,680
who created the script which for example
show you the boxes in a game so you can

316
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,730
actually see where it will strike you
before it strikes so it's it's it's a

317
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:22,330
cool stuff but you can actually do that
without any code change so you have just

318
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:26,069
a scripting language in which you can do
that and that's that's really good

319
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:31,070
because it lets people imagination
working they they they could create

320
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:37,550
something you and the good thing is also
that you know I've been working with two

321
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:44,800
different computers different devices
and during the time they're just over on

322
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,460
my to-do technology and we just need to
move into it to improve ourselves and to

323
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:54,089
be able to emulate something from the
past in order to use it for example now

324
00:40:54,089 --> 00:41:03,259
you just can't execute any of MS DOS
sixteen-bit applications you were able

325
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:10,460
to do that on the 32 bit OS but you
can't do that on the 64 bit OS so yeah

326
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,260
we need to find a way

327
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:17,470
order to to make people be able to use
those kind of applications because they

328
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:23,270
taste or just a word they don't need a
counter move their software or they

329
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:28,900
don't want to do that it it's i mean
it's easier to emulate walks and just to

330
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:35,910
copy all software and then use the same
sort over there and the Reach beta or to

331
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:41,410
just you know taking rewrite everything
so it's that would be very time

332
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:46,720
consuming any other questions

333
00:41:46,720 --> 00:42:07,868
okay you said that your software that
you want to make sure that you're not

334
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:15,619
against someone's copyright yeah so do
you have some criteria are you decide if

335
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:19,580
something is abandoned whether or not
you mentioned Windows 2000

336
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,569
imagine you would not put this into your
code database you know so what do you

337
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,130
put in

338
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:32,150
well just let me explain basically what
we what we put in our database these are

339
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:36,590
just some final aim size

340
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:43,560
Searcy and as they do that one so you
basically have just a hash of and the

341
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:51,210
size which is enough to distinguish
files and we do not provide any of those

342
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:58,650
rooms because we can't and there are
some companies they gave us the right to

343
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:05,950
provide their rooms and basically you
can find on our site those are just some

344
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:11,410
simple games but it's it's ok I mean
during the time we believe that there

345
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:16,618
will be some other companies that will
also give their games for free and at

346
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:21,790
least those will be available they can't
sell it anymore but the main problem is

347
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:30,900
that you have issues like for example if
it was a game from Sony irri you have a

348
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:37,359
CD which contains the data that is not
that problematic so you will have the

349
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:43,730
company that is having right on the coat
but the problem is for example that

350
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:52,839
music is that is used for that game was
licensed just for that one release and

351
00:43:52,839 --> 00:44:00,830
for the time period of iron ore 34 years
and after debt even Sony can't sell it

352
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:06,650
anymore with those songs they need to
put something else or 23 license so it's

353
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:13,320
really mean those legal stuff for really
freaky and we are trying to be out of

354
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:20,080
that but you know it's it's as I said
it's for example for the realizing it's

355
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:25,950
really time consuming just to contact
all the people to ask them what license

356
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:31,210
would like to go for their code to be
used but then you have other problems

357
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:37,410
some of the people just don't understand
the difference between licenses not sure

358
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:43,299
if they're not sure how they will be
protected and i think is that what we

359
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:49,170
noticed is that may be licensed didn't
protect anyone basically think that we

360
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:54,119
changed in past research it's not
allowed to be used in commercial use

361
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:56,650
didn't save us from commercial use

362
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:00,820
I mean everyone is convinced actually
did that and we can't do anything

363
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:04,690
because we are not recognized

364
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:11,420
license you know and there is no we
don't have a lawyer who will go and say

365
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:16,890
you know but it also depends in which
country you are and it's it's kind of

366
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,410
complex things but we never stored

367
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:25,980
delivered to software we just delivered
the cash and the name and size which is

368
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,930
enough to distinguish them

369
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:45,308
yeah it's really easy to find any rooms
for for me was i mean they always ask

370
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:53,630
why do we put fruit machines why do we
put people machines I mean those are our

371
00:45:53,630 --> 00:46:00,630
kids for now they're not playable that's
the fact there are also a lot of drivers

372
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:06,910
that are not playable they're not
emulation is not finished or protection

373
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:18,149
is not yet done and basically what we
see is that people always give the fool

374
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:27,030
sad and officially you can always get
the full set of games listed so people

375
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:32,230
people will attend download torrents etc
and they will distribute that all over

376
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:37,790
the world so it's off to reveal be
preserved that way so basically we are

377
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:44,000
making sure that not only nice things
are saved but everything is basically

378
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,180
saved so even if it's produced by the
IBM or if it's produced by Sony or if is

379
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:54,950
produced by some company that never
heard of it will be saved you know and

380
00:46:54,950 --> 00:47:00,009
that's that's the goal goal of the of
the preservation of sort of the tree are

381
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:02,730
trying to achieve

382
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:25,339
ok I think that will be ok one more
question sir

383
00:47:25,339 --> 00:47:32,670
hi I have a question you're sad that
name was once open source and then it

384
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:38,460
went close or similar rights to do so
don't know if it was always source

385
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:45,759
available but it's basically I mean it
was you you can always download source

386
00:47:45,759 --> 00:47:48,579
but it was never open source

387
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:54,009
recent times yeah so the source was
available I can public domain or yeah

388
00:47:54,009 --> 00:47:59,359
yeah you could basically download each
release SVN

389
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:06,190
you notice good SVN was not public and
you could actually not see whole

390
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:14,819
development during a time when the
release time comes we replace the source

391
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:21,900
code at our website so so that's
basically change now we moved to GitHub

392
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:27,809
and basically you can have the source
always available and you can download

393
00:48:27,809 --> 00:48:40,779
even though all the releases from the
0.1% thank you I believe that it so

394
00:48:40,779 --> 00:48:45,450
thank you everyone and I wish you good
rest of the day
