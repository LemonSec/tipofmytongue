1
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,810
so hello everybody welcome to the dog
about 3d printing please read our soccer

2
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:43,149
and its art gallery 11 steamer my name
is Jordan markowitz I am infrastructure

3
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:50,699
process plant manager in company to the
systems worldwide leader of 3d solutions

4
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:56,960
I would say we manufacture the printers
daughter social the scanners and

5
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:06,460
everything but allows us to realize the
model real 3d models from 3d sketch

6
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:16,210
today if my presentation your work we
thought about 3d printing what is it how

7
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,490
it works

8
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:28,339
what kind of materials machines we have

9
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:36,250
well what is the point of 3d printing
the point of the 3d printing is to come

10
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:42,979
from virtual 3d model to the real model
and application of 3d printing started

11
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:49,030
for a big industries for a lot of
different path of industry of car

12
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:57,159
industry of electronics of sport
equipment healt occasion and we started

13
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:03,000
to democratize the social and now we are
able to have the small trade apprentice

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,880
even for every home and you can even
print the toys for your kids

15
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:16,519
demeanor the big importance of the
painting is to realize a real model and

16
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:23,579
validated the concept if it means I will
designed some something designed some

17
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:31,060
parked for the cars on the screen but
once I printed I can't really see all

18
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:38,730
the possible errors they could make or
even all things that I could I have to

19
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:46,660
do modification of it just because we
have validated part after that we

20
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:55,250
started to go farther in the electronics
for example the cell phones we make the

21
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,950
design of our cell phones we put
electronic inside validated the concept

22
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,358
and once we make the hard work of our
cell phones working properly because

23
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:10,980
start with the serial production so it
is kind of intermediate stage between

24
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:19,120
development and industrialization and it
can save us a lot of money because once

25
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,519
we make some errors and we discovered
them during the production process

26
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:38,079
unfortunately we lose a lot of money and
first of all the subjects I will try I

27
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:43,129
would like to talk about the beginnings
of disappointing because we started to

28
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:48,540
talk about a couple years ago but 3d
printing technology exists for thirty

29
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:56,670
years thirty years you're printing in
plastics metal and now we are even able

30
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:04,708
to print in chocolate or sugar in color
or monochrome also about how it works to

31
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:12,349
debating how we printing 3d what is the
secret what is the procedure is a

32
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:18,250
principle principle to the painting
about the printers and all interesting

33
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:27,510
applications of the printing let's start
about 3d pretty how it works well you

34
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:35,860
will see the liquid plastic plastics and
laser that polymerize later police after

35
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,390
every layer

36
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:44,050
platform to build a hard plastic hose
down and it makes us the final model

37
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:51,789
that technology is named the
stereographic and reused photosensitive

38
00:04:51,789 --> 00:05:04,260
polymer technologies very used in car
industry because for big parts real size

39
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:09,830
part of the cars trucks planes and
everything else we can make the weekly

40
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:16,760
the real or those them on the cars for
example all the new prototypes of Mary

41
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:22,389
luxury cars are presented it lot of
printed pass because we can paint them

42
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,220
brush them all these them

43
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:29,120
we can do a lot of things with as we
have different types of plastic

44
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,450
materials can really present for
functional prototype we can print with

45
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:44,130
the liquid materials I mean this is
liquid plastics sensitive to you is or

46
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,409
solid materials but for materials are
plastic polymers and we mounted a major

47
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:55,780
player the main principle 3d printing is
reprinted the layer-by-layer if you got

48
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,719
to the circles and you put the circus
you get the cylinder with the printing

49
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:13,630
is so technically it's not very
complicated process we can also hear is

50
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:20,990
power steering have 10 weeks later who
will melt the plastic layer of plastic

51
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:28,100
that we can get another layer of plastic
powder will melt it up to and of the

52
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,030
part and in couple of hours we have our
part

53
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:38,020
finished about price range we have three
groups of printers we have the personal

54
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:47,760
ones from 2200 euros up to 20,000 euros
we have professional machines used by

55
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,500
engineers architects people who will
make the concepts whom we make the

56
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:59,890
projects before in the nation and we
have production printers that means with

57
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:05,659
those big machines we manufacture the
parts that you will mount in different

58
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:12,270
in the three field for example General
Electric electrics has something like I

59
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:19,090
would say forty fifty year tradition
industrial printers otherwise all bigger

60
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:24,849
industrial leaders are also equipped
with British Formula One

61
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:30,649
teams also every formula 1 team has 3d
printers when they have some idea to

62
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:37,889
make some design some new parts they
just making Detroit intermediate some

63
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:43,979
kids tools and then they printed they
can mount it on the track that shaped

64
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:49,089
put it in the winter know and really
increase the performance of our dynamics

65
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:57,319
otherwise when we make some parts for
the planes or cars of any industry which

66
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:08,119
we do the same texts lie about the
clients in the range when we don't when

67
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:15,099
the hammer to break something is only
way to do the things that we go to 3d

68
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:20,519
printing some paths somehow some parts
are not possible to be done by

69
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:27,719
conventional working methods and we need
to print them because advantage of 3d

70
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:32,769
printing is there is no limits as you
make a layup alia that means that we can

71
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:38,198
imagine this fair in this fair and they
can put you print we're in the very

72
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:44,339
least one part otherwise we can also
print as complete assemblies assembly

73
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:49,589
that you can move only one party cannot
December to need to break it otherwise

74
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:56,240
you would need to spend a lot of time to
make this by Miley drilling and other

75
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,939
professional

76
00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:05,819
manufacturing methods ok

77
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:11,259
the man on the last hole the father of
3d printing

78
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:19,159
hole in 86 had no idea he was working
with photosensitive coatings for normal

79
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:25,409
to the printing and he discovered that
with you is he can put a layer only so

80
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:32,179
he designed first graphic machines and
he started the 3d printing career to the

81
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:42,720
printing revolution during those 30
years we got in my portfolio the clients

82
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:53,109
big companies like IBM Airbus 2002 BMW
edicts statements and all other

83
00:09:53,109 --> 00:10:03,049
industrial companies using our printers
even the earplug devices now are printed

84
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:10,319
plastic part are printed so we just put
electronics and we can customize their

85
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:17,819
plaques for every year like this we have
more comfort and better efficiency of

86
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:30,149
healthcare acquit devices and equipment
otherwise yes prep for plane about the

87
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:36,069
parts that the printing we can really
have the small and very complicated but

88
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:41,899
and still want certain amount of those
parts we are cheaper to manufacture them

89
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:51,139
through the apprentice then with some
cereal production also as mentioned

90
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:54,329
before make car parts

91
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:58,910
the plane

92
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:07,890
protest is also pretty the faxes and we
can use this for lost their small things

93
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:14,720
that means I can have I can design for
my wife for example ring if I will ask

94
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,010
for a wedding hand printed in the box
after that I can make a small sent mold

95
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:29,569
and they have my master part and also I
make a custom made jewelry with everyone

96
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:36,150
and I mailed the gold and they create
marrying abolish it and it's done a lot

97
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:44,180
of very a lot of Oriental jewelry
companies are working with those methods

98
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:50,670
money factor to make for their clients
customized parts and really designed

99
00:11:50,670 --> 00:12:02,569
parts parts for both your compatibility
we can use our materials printed

100
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:09,350
especially difficult reading materials
can be used in operations phones that

101
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:18,090
means we have some specifications that
you need to respect about cleaning back

102
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:24,520
to resolve the stuff and we can really
we can really use them in the operation

103
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:31,350
room concrete example I had surgery
orthopaedic surgery asking me can we

104
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:41,420
make specific drill machine guides that
allows us to drill the ball on specific

105
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,370
and go

106
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,220
just

107
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:50,630
customized to the patient that means
scanning 3d porn that today we designed

108
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:57,580
our part to his leg and his bomb and
just put to fix something in specific

109
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:15,130
position this decided by doctors surgery
and it was possible and small trade

110
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,910
apprentice the printers you can have
your home

111
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:25,260
those printers are working with very
simple method very have just roll with

112
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:33,250
ABS or PLA plastic it will heat and melt
your plastics and then later hopefully

113
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:39,640
we can design the path it's a perfect
solution for two started to the painting

114
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:48,760
you can even manage couple of colors so
it can even make a mix of 30 for some

115
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:55,260
for some unique parts very will just
show the shape of the party it's a very

116
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:01,400
cheap and efficient technology and what
is also interesting about this kind of

117
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,260
person printers there is heaps of
open-source machines that means I will

118
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,830
give you after that some websites you
can't really alter the kids and how to

119
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:17,940
do and you can really make for less than
500 euros your own printer i mean to

120
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:24,650
normal to the printers who can make one
to the print and it's it's all it's it's

121
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:30,290
a beginning it already something you can
decide for example your house or

122
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,370
whatever you want and you can train
today you can have it in your hand

123
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:40,620
otherwise between plaintiffs you can
even print the sugar even in color that

124
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:46,770
means if you have some wedding cake as
normal wedding cake you can scan your

125
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:53,530
bride and the man you can print them in
the sugar and then the lady at the head

126
00:14:53,530 --> 00:15:00,010
of the guy after the wedding so you're
talking later can even play with if

127
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,880
you're some kind of creative person you
can play with flavor of your chocolate

128
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:13,769
and design the power to talk alleged
that that you will eat after

129
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:21,619
in relation with the flavor of chocolate
otherwise we can also print width 396

130
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:27,920
callers and use these kinds of to the
printing for architects architectural

131
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,509
this present the quarters the buildings
the house as before we had the guys who

132
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:39,439
are who they were making the most of the
house of the quarter all the stuff and

133
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:45,689
it was a painful job now we have treated
to the drawing and you just printed

134
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:52,579
colors and a couple of hours to have the
presentation of how it looks like our

135
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:58,878
new house or flat weekend even managed
very were gonna put the living room the

136
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:04,410
bedroom or the stuff you print and the
final client will buy the house can see

137
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:10,559
perfectly how it is called arrange the
things and what very heated to some of

138
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:18,118
the situations it's really give us
another his vision of the future

139
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:29,720
about open source printers here are some
of the websites where you can find

140
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:38,019
really all informations about print US
Rep rob is one of the first

141
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:45,470
maker but it's kind of yeah they started
like open source but then came also the

142
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,799
professional part of the story and they
also try to get some money and make some

143
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:58,529
money wait this even brought to the Hogs
all the website gives you

144
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:06,000
tutorials how and how to create our own
through the printer for trip to print

145
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,740
with through the apprentice you need to
have STL files so if you have some cat

146
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,959
software there is also a frigid waters
can download one for Linux for example

147
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,390
of cricket or even for Windows or Mac it
works perfectly

148
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:29,000
you can design your parts and with the
couple of hundreds of euros you can have

149
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,580
your own 3d printer photos in this time
I wanted to bring one printer but they

150
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,010
came on holidays and all the stuff it in
her place in my car to show you how it

151
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:51,049
really prints in the in the real time
but for next year why not the schools

152
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:59,039
now we thought to print 3d when you
start to go to school

153
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,260
parroting changed a little bit and now
we start to work with through the

154
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:09,620
apprentice it helps to the people to
understand how it works and it brings

155
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:18,120
also also of you out of the box it
really really learn how to see the

156
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,989
things differently and the things what's
not possible before now they're becoming

157
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:30,990
possible and it starts to become no
limit I showed you a lot of parts made

158
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:37,980
in plastics but you can also make metal
parts and the big in the three are very

159
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,720
investing a lot of money in metal parts
it's also the metal powder stainless

160
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:55,340
steel hard metal and other noble metals
them all so we don't print them we have

161
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:01,320
also the powder have time later will
melt layer upon layer but the tuning of

162
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,899
the laser the strength of the laser and
other stuff it's a really

163
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:15,710
a fine tuning stuff and for sure for
schools high-tech engineering schools

164
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:22,880
universities now we start to have in
every school through the painter and it

165
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,620
helped thought I know mechanical
engineer and designer gear box and you

166
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,459
print the gearbox and you can check how
it can have the risks you can make a

167
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:43,640
real saudi riyal functional model it
helps a lot it makes our manufacturing

168
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:54,530
time of the thing much much faster
otherwise I have one nice example of

169
00:19:54,530 --> 00:20:07,440
babysit one is more like all feature can
buy from 50 to 500 euros second one is

170
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:15,060
printed in plastics if you see a
shock-absorbing graphics you will see

171
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:28,960
that both are identical hundred-percent
is that ok for manufacturing what is the

172
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:37,850
use of why should you print more
expansive and when we have special

173
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:43,689
requests for the children or for the
people who did especially economic but

174
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:51,340
it's much cheaper and faster to print it
then to manufactory to it when you make

175
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:57,550
it with the last site technology we need
to have minimal quantity of part to have

176
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:02,970
a reasonable price here if we make one
or five hundred the price per the price

177
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,900
per item is it ethical

178
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,299
just count the material in my time you

179
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:20,908
used for this otherwise we have for
example conventional yesterday painting

180
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:29,769
same part retain function you have the
air passing through the part with

181
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:35,149
conventional methods you need for tools
you have north on that path to have

182
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:40,389
standard parts you have lower health
assembly work and it takes more time and

183
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:48,080
it's more expensive than directly
printed out there is not all there is no

184
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:55,850
standard parties no clothes and I think
real application of this its cooling

185
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,600
systems of electronics in

186
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,100
commonplace in combat planes as they
have a lot of electronics left right up

187
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:10,178
and down you need really to have
ventilation very complicated pipes and

188
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:17,049
parts well with this kind of methods who
needs 10 days to make finish finish

189
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:22,320
final part withdrew the painting you
make it in one day and you just mounted

190
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:29,418
in the plane Airbus started to use this
kind of technologies to make sure to do

191
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:38,000
to realize that not functional parts of
the plains so when you in the new Airbus

192
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,020
a320 series will have to the pretty part
of the holders the brackets and all

193
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,879
things that don't concern the structure
of the plane and are printed it goes

194
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:59,200
much faster and make the lighter parts
about materials we can have a wide range

195
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,659
of materials and Britain have also
reinforced materials plastics metals

196
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:10,620
plastics carbon fiber with nanoparticles
with the party

197
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:17,689
with glass on the particles and for 1.5
kilos per deciliter cuba decimator we

198
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,010
can't have really really originated in
the resistant arts as resistant and

199
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:22,809
rigidity

200
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:29,910
mount them in Formula One and go on the
races with them ok for one is example of

201
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:35,710
expect expensive technologies but at
least it's possible and you don't need

202
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:45,380
to have 25 hours a day to finish the
party to put the party on the one before

203
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:51,000
the race which is pretty and let's go
even the Navy American heavy Russian

204
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,730
Navy the metal print British for the
metal parts on the on the ships and dip

205
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:05,660
into the step out if they have if they
have all spare parts they need during

206
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:13,850
their during one year they spent over
the sea one part of the places for spare

207
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,389
parts

208
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:21,260
rent-a-center couple of types of metals
materials you have just the minimum of

209
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:27,230
you just need more space and you can
print whatever you want if you need some

210
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:33,690
screw you print some school if you need
some access to Prince of Maxis even now

211
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:41,429
we're talking about Italian printing and
implementation and we are going to reach

212
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:48,490
achieve this this moment also and
healthcare is really windy progress

213
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:58,080
through the printing solutions otherwise
I think that you can see in the

214
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,750
healthcare kind of equipment you can
print so if you

215
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:19,540
ear plug or bodies completely printed
and report also printed the protesters

216
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:26,220
printed printed also for one dog who
didn't have the problem it likes to from

217
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:34,910
the front legs he couldn't never walk
with them because the weekend cut the I

218
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,540
think you can even find the clip on
YouTube and deeper into the protesters

219
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:47,440
for the dog and dog races started to run
and to enjoy the life on as never before

220
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,940
so even for a pet has a problem it's
something you can try to find a way to

221
00:25:52,940 --> 00:26:01,020
resolve the problem it to the printing
dental industry also now for the

222
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:12,660
pretentious you don't take the truth
anymore with this kind of Rob

223
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:22,750
government stuff is kinda treaty once
the scan it we reprint and then we can

224
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:27,010
really make custom made for dangerous
for this person cause everybody has his

225
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:35,830
own or 4G and reduced technologists
people really are dropped or repair kit

226
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:40,840
tools for the to the person and they
disagreed have better results and

227
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,830
finally we are humans and if we develop
some scientists and technologists it's a

228
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:52,290
good way to the human to improve the
capacities of human rights to kill other

229
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,159
human

230
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,320
otherwise I think the big boom of 3d
printing is the guy who made his gun

231
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,950
which to the painting it's it's more or
less fake I mean you can print some

232
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:13,140
parts with multiple enter the printer
but after first showed it will explode

233
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,650
in your hand it capped at your hand so
you can really print couple of

234
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:26,320
decorative parts and I think that he'll
care is much more interesting than

235
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:37,810
manufacturing of guns otherwise if you
have any questions because I don't know

236
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:54,290
maybe yes

237
00:27:54,290 --> 00:28:05,590
for the supports that hold the parts of
its territory graphic the supports are

238
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:10,929
made in the same material than the part
you need to remove them and climate

239
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:15,330
solvents want to claim with solvents is
a popular all is a proper legal alcohol

240
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:21,000
or acetone or metal hip hop on all
whatever you just put you cure their

241
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:31,330
part in kind of box with your lights or
America relapse during 10 or 30 metres

242
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:37,490
depends of the path and one you have so
this kind of post process

243
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:45,320
work if you work with real 3d printers
to print through the printhead then you

244
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,610
have their support is the racks just
puts the part in the oven the fax is

245
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:56,840
gone and you have your part when we talk
about the powder powders metal metal or

246
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,010
plastic bothers you just take out your
part we use just a little bit of

247
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:05,990
compressed air and it's done that's why

248
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:17,020
new movie in 3d printing industry
technologies are melted plastic folders

249
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:22,340
with laser because once you finish your
party just received a little bit and

250
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:58,820
just mounted and next time you make it
whatever you want like part we just got

251
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:05,290
into slices slice it so you don't need
any one although up or on laser will

252
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,770
just make heart

253
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:12,260
later and it's done it's not fancy
machine when you do you need to mail

254
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,290
something or to draw something you need
to search some angles but here my first

255
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:24,340
layers are up to 80 microns player so
you can just move the layer police your

256
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:33,550
call is just moving and I mean there is
you don't need really to think about 45

257
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:38,659
access when you work with some CNC
machines then yes but here everything is

258
00:30:38,660 --> 00:31:02,990
just like a player so players can be or
whatever you decide the questions I try

259
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:09,550
I have tried them and I'm just wondering
have you tried MakerBot is dead

260
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:15,669
battered and Auntie house is like
throwing few dozen more just to have it

261
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:22,500
well I mean all of them have the
moralist same problem the problem of

262
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:32,010
them its first first player on the plate
you need to put some glue or something

263
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:40,350
that will keep make fix the first layer
to the platform platform and heel

264
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:46,820
problem is all the more open so the most
of them are opened so about you need to

265
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:54,580
to print with ABS have completely
controlled temperature around around

266
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:59,659
town to certify degrees the most of the
people don't do it first who was the

267
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:05,440
leader of this kind of printers or even
industrial applications

268
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:11,000
the Stratasys Stratasys Stratasys
printers are closed all around us close

269
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,779
and you can have nice part about

270
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:22,119
open-source Prentice I think that there
is no big big big difference between you

271
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:26,689
know used to work I reported the systems
I work with cubes

272
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:32,769
I mean I work with you I have couple of
cubes in just four tests and 24

273
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:37,259
presentation and for sure even cubes of
ice cubes had the same problem now new

274
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:44,440
one are closed completely and it works
better my final answer with any printer

275
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:51,969
personal printer you imagine just closed
it controlled temperature of around the

276
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:57,649
northern route pretty good we are and
then it will be ok and do you have a

277
00:32:57,649 --> 00:33:04,408
space here in north side where people
can come in and no not really

278
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:11,089
unfortunately Serbia is there a couple
of bookshops it's more printers in

279
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:15,070
Belgrade Serbia is really the fortunes
in not yet

280
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:18,070
account where people from here

281
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:23,879
want to invest in through the printing
solutions won't allow for traffic not

282
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:30,360
share some professional machines in
croatia pennsylvania about malcolm but

283
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:41,570
here in serbia for something that yet
but I think that you need to have a big

284
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:48,939
industry an industry in progress
developing industry with industry has

285
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:54,399
your interview I don't think that this
is really something that will come in

286
00:33:54,399 --> 00:34:04,059
next month's thanks so I have a question
so what's the smallest possible size of

287
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:11,918
3d printing and is there any use now in
materials and while about terry talked a

288
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:20,219
few process there is another story too
graphic process so in 0:18 millimeters

289
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:26,799
you can print formula 1 complete for
more on this is tired of smallest part

290
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:34,550
you can really print you can print
really not a part about the main parts I

291
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:40,700
can't be in the path of two meters by
one metre without any problem so we have

292
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:49,098
a really wide range and about
nanoparticles be put in plastics

293
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:53,679
nanoparticles to make the plastics to
increase the performance of the material

294
00:34:53,679 --> 00:35:00,160
to have stronger material resistance to
the bigger high temperatures for example

295
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:10,160
one of materials manufacturer you can
work with 230 degrees it's a plastic

296
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:21,339
material but its 330 temperature some of
companies that make kind of particular

297
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:24,130
cell source are you are using them

298
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:30,610
to take the measurements of pressure the
used three different bodies to put

299
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,980
electronics and it'll go in some

300
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:39,560
230 degrees atmospheres 282 the
resulting stairs during the measuring

301
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:45,410
type and it's the machines they that
have this kind of sensors are running 24

302
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:54,089
hours per day so yes when you play with
those nanoparticles and all the staff

303
00:35:54,090 --> 00:36:01,660
increase the performance we can create
the rigidity the temperature and remove

304
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,200
a little bit the possibilities because
when you want to use making directional

305
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,970
some high temperature materials
everything costs them all costs

306
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:18,589
the machinery the material and sometimes
you need some small series of 10 15 20

307
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:22,930
years items so that the items you need
to create the mall inheriting your bill

308
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,919
is very high

309
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:33,130
you print them ok maybe or maybe a
hundred euros per part but it's still

310
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:39,710
cheaper to make complete industrial
process for 10 or 15 items or 10 titles

311
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:46,500
and about career manufacturing with
three painters there is a graphics and

312
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,020
all you can calculate deal how many
parts your cheaper with 3d printing and

313
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:57,240
from where you need to think you should
other matters some bad some small

314
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,660
complicated parts can make a lot of them
into the painting before you start to

315
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,790
make them

316
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,370
with conventional

317
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:13,759
manufacturing methods for example
medical devices medical tools denies the

318
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:30,780
Special Surgery tolls if you don't print
them first of all you cannot make all

319
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:38,410
shapes you want so really possibility to
make something real custom-made and

320
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:43,279
there is no limit ok I need to I cannot
reach this angry because I couldn't make

321
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,320
it I just make whatever I want and
faster and this kind of tools for

322
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,530
example the quantity you need you can
make a return trip before you consider

323
00:37:54,530 --> 00:38:06,289
other questions

324
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:07,009
thanks
