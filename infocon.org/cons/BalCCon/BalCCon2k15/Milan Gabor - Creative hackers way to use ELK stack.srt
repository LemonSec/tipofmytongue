1
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,470
1

2
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:28,529
is about creating more accurate way to
use elk steak by me on guareber let's

3
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:36,610
start

4
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:43,519
hi everybody I hope you're enjoying your
time here in obviously enjoying or

5
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:52,420
having hangover both ik both then do you
enjoyed yesterday in your will to today

6
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:59,890
ok so little bit little bit about
presentation so alch for data doesn't

7
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,660
know it so its elastic search box tashin
cabana you will get more familiar

8
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,560
rhetoric stack but before that

9
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:16,540
who am I i run the small companies
slovenia what would a preacher man as

10
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,979
the preacher this is my second time in
August last year we had been together

11
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:30,479
with almighty Daniel here presenting
some other stuff and since last year I

12
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,050
also fly drones because last year you
had the drawings and I i got hooked on

13
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:42,020
the John so this is one of my pictures
taken from John and this is the last

14
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,548
year last year we have been playing with
all mobile applications and this year we

15
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:51,760
it's an alkyl it's a delicate time
someone's gonna be agenda lookin

16
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,549
Hecker's problems of course record
solutions because you don't only want to

17
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,130
talk about the problems are we going to
talk a little but Alex tack and

18
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:07,899
specially with combination regarding the
visualization of mobile wifi and real

19
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,720
get some crazy ideas in the end so you
can you can try it you can't ride home

20
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:24,000
so what is the problem at the moment
with VY fired by five regionalization

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,049
the somebody recognize this have
somebody seen it here it's up there if

22
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:36,060
you don't know it it's up there it's
taped wi-fi access points and sexually

23
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,350
tapes pretty well so it won't fell down
but do you know who is connected to the

24
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,989
wifi hotspot

25
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:52,090
CDF now it's not the CTF it was not CTR
but it was the wifi connector but

26
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,870
wouldn't be interesting to see who is
actually connected without writing a

27
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:03,030
single line of code would be nice

28
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,810
ok you can do this so you can do spectra
analyzes of two point four gigs or five

29
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,670
digs for visualization of i-5 packets
but can you spot some packets here can

30
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:25,369
you get some connection yes we do see
some packet here here what kind of IP

31
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:33,680
does it have a car so with this one it's
not so very good ok we know this part

32
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,860
much more better right

33
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:41,350
so this is our crack families so error
damp so he's either did you see that

34
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,950
there are vital connection you see the
MAC addresses are you see the probes

35
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,470
that your phone sir sending out and some
other stuff

36
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,240
who never used that he doesn't know how
this works

37
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:07,310
you don't know if we now go to let's say
here so this is visualization of wi-fi

38
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:14,340
traffic with aircrack paradigm in this
moment so is he that my network card is

39
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:22,220
jumping so it's helping the channels and
here is actually the wi-fi access points

40
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,680
and their MAC addresses the power
manufacturing the rest of the stuff so

41
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,520
it's it's kind of turmoil oriented but
wouldn't be nice if you would have liked

42
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,310
this why do revisited ization it so
important these days because still our

43
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,270
eyes and our brains can capture really
fast if there is some really good

44
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,490
visualization so we gonna go today I'm
going to show you how you come from this

45
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,639
this part so from Hecker part

46
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,490
two days without a single line of code
no programming are there any programmers

47
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:08,949
here who's doing programming ok you
liked it right

48
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:18,080
some years from now ok but before we dig
into there are some other ways how to

49
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,568
visualize or get some kind of
information P cap to acknowledge one of

50
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:29,020
that kind of tools but the problem is
that you get something like this so we

51
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:35,779
see collide database and author of this
tool is my children I guess if you're if

52
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:44,219
you're into wifi you know Vivek oh he's
done some great sex acts in the past but

53
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:50,069
the other challenge of us can we do it
really without any writing on the lines

54
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:55,360
of code and get the really good
visualization without any programming so

55
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,719
that was our goal that was our goal that
we started when we started our research

56
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:09,060
ok but before start what do we need
anything but you need to forget want to

57
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:19,479
get see what's actually going on on wifi
any clues wireless card yes so you need

58
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:26,318
a hardware and a softer right so hard
her regarding hardware definitely euro

59
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,520
for wireless card or something else some
kind of good job said but for monitoring

60
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,589
you don't need some let's say really
advanced chipset because you won't be

61
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:41,800
doing any kind of injection of USB
cables are you going to see The to need

62
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,089
a lot of power if you're if you're doing
on the big elasticsearch cluster behind

63
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:50,370
and you need a big screen

64
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,529
why if you want to visualize some stuff
if you have if you're trying to do it

65
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:59,710
this on a 15 inch screen your own seem
that much gonna see that even on this

66
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:06,330
projector we will have some some issues
without and with disaster

67
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,750
regarding the sister site it doesn't
matter what you run Linux Mac Windows

68
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:18,169
but you need to keep in mind that you
might run into some kind of issues

69
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:25,780
especially if you're on the run on the
Raspberry Pi it is possible to run out

70
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:33,599
stuck on the Raspberry Pi but it won't
run very fast ok so we have now are hard

71
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:40,050
to her so wireless card one machine and
we have saucer but we need two more

72
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:50,879
things we need environment so elastic
stack and we need data so let's go for

73
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,050
the first let's go with environments
with environment for building an

74
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,139
ecstatic you need three components or
maybe four if you're doing lets a long

75
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,550
stretch for those who have some sensors
somewhere on that and i textes for

76
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:14,240
elasticsearch luck stash and Gabbana so
this is kind of off so if you see

77
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,360
something like this with cabana three
you know you will notice very fast that

78
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,310
this is keep an eye on this is kind of
four so it's a it's a major change right

79
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:30,520
from Blair going to white and some other
stuff so but it has some advantages

80
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,019
already will be the new version but
they're not so many features at their

81
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:42,610
development so there are some stuff from
China challenges has left so if we take

82
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,589
a quick look at the ax tak so we have
summer lock ship purse or somebody who's

83
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:52,329
actually pulling or pushing called
deluxe summary you have the locks their

84
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:57,589
server which processes dislikes and then
you have in storage where you put this

85
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:01,959
into electric search and then you have
web interface with your cabana was

86
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:10,430
actually visualizing this whole life I
packets I won't go into details step by

87
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,469
steps if you tried to google how to us
is tal el Khoury elasticsearch lockstep

88
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,710
you'll get really good

89
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:25,940
good tutorial whatever you need to do it
there are several steps no complication

90
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:32,690
it's not complicated story have clean of
12 you can have an ecstatic running in

91
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,550
lets less than an hour or so but it
depends from your Linux or Windows

92
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:45,550
skills so just like stash its takes care
for receiving and processing confirmed

93
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:51,400
in blocks and also kind of doing some
transformations if you want this is the

94
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,180
only part of the lock / unlock station
has also one component that is called

95
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,000
lost touch for murder it's actually just
a small agents it can collect locks or

96
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,630
WiFi logs from its a small sensors
installed all around the network it's

97
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:17,560
already prepared for some platforms but
if you're tried to do it on Raspberry Pi

98
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:24,550
or on some other exotic it's a
distribution then you might get you into

99
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:29,430
then you might run into some kind of
problems but it can be solved if you use

100
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,739
for example of one Windows you can use
annex locks or if you're running on

101
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:43,150
Raspberry Pi there is a bigger so it's a
python package or you can just use as

102
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:51,140
long as local social order for foreign
logins the second part the most

103
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:58,240
important part is actually elasticsearch
it's hard to say it's no secret or

104
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,360
something else actually is distributed
search engine that you can be building

105
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:10,200
up the big large cluster and it casts
really nice AP ice so if you're using

106
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,140
Python Java or something else you can do
really good stuff with it and it has

107
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,250
REST API its open on port

108
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:34,580
9200 so if we want to try to play with
my not sure but you can get the output

109
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:42,920
just using the curl to localhost if you
have just search sink empty and it gives

110
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,069
you some kind of information already so
this party is arrested search and there

111
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:53,010
is a cabana who actually doing this kind
of transformation from outperform from

112
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:59,620
electric search it gets you something
like this ever gonna see how you gonna

113
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,940
created for short steps

114
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:10,340
wifi visualization like this and you're
gonna see that you can take really good

115
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:15,180
into this kind of pie charts the
somebody has a deal what's actually this

116
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,620
this and this and this

117
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:24,850
any ideas what can be on wifi what kind
of the data I guess this is number of

118
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:37,200
clients right because there's loads and
the other stuff no but we gonna be

119
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,630
literally gonna see how it's easy to
create this kind of the stuff and get

120
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:50,740
even maybe to some of your phones ok
when we set up by Malik we definitely

121
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:56,700
run into some kind of issues are first
of all if you're setting up this in some

122
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:02,060
let's tee hostile environment there's
some issue with because there's no

123
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,609
security there is June you can just
block it

124
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:13,730
block someone on any IP addresses but if
you want to use some kind of event

125
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:19,800
features like that actually
elasticsearch has it sold for user

126
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,780
authentication you need to pay its not
free anymore elasticsearch it's free

127
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:31,500
and there are also some other components
like like what you're actually sending

128
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:39,790
the sending alerts and this is also not
three so it's actually under constant

129
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,589
development and there are some really
big changes if you're moving from cabana

130
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:49,680
3 software version 32 version for and
sometimes you miss some kind of

131
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,250
functionality so you cannot do some
stuff that we really wanted and

132
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:04,230
regarding the security check on showdown
who knows what jordan is also sean is a

133
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:16,190
kind of search engine even better for
defectors so I tried to search for

134
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:23,930
serbia offer elasticsearch and Sheldon
gives me two sites with this service is

135
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,699
Christian I and this one is I don't know
somewhere

136
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:34,370
program dot org and their related
searches open to the internet so if they

137
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,390
have some interesting data just
connector it

138
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:43,910
issue of search or maybe you can even
you can even configure your own cabana

139
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,579
connect cubano without elastic certainly
got all the day today it's actually

140
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:54,200
starting that in Texas so that is
regarding the security with

141
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:00,200
elasticsearch ok so we got environment
so this is how we already built

142
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:06,740
elasticsearch we can put inside the data
so we have our environment but we still

143
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:22,460
need date so as seen before with this is
my so with this one with this Erlbaum

144
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,080
see it gives you

145
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:31,600
just screen so terminal screen you gotta
output from Jason you have you had some

146
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,440
temporary data but it's not quite useful
if you want to try to put it inside the

147
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:44,200
inside their expect so we tried two
different things because dumps are

148
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:50,450
cranked and she doesn't speak Jason we
tried to run it we try to parse it we

149
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:58,170
try to parse XML logs that can spit out
from her crack but nothing didn't work

150
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:06,589
so I actually the winner to do this to
get the Jason outside of the dump was

151
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:13,740
changing the source code we're still
thinking to contribute to the main

152
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:22,350
branch of the dump and we did little bit
face lifting of our crack so the first

153
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:29,570
thing that we noticed is I don't know
when exactly but this number changed

154
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:37,140
last year in a half what's actually here
in the original source code its number

155
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:46,430
ten in number 10 this is number of the
props that actually era damp keeps

156
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:53,380
maximum number of the profited keeps
inside his inside his inside his list

157
00:16:53,380 --> 00:17:00,370
when it's running why did we have
problems with this because most of our

158
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,480
phone sending more than 10 crops so I
got a person at once

159
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,870
conference his phone was spitting out
more than hundred Probst who knows what

160
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:15,780
the problems are okay three

161
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:21,379
the props hard especially crafted by
five packets that your phones are

162
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,690
sending out with questioning

163
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,860
I have been connected to that kind of
wireless network is that wireless

164
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:35,570
network here so we're going to see in a
graph

165
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:43,600
that we can get a lot of this network
props so with this why would be this

166
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,740
probes would be interesting for the
hackers because with getting those props

167
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:54,440
I can locate very have been so going
around ok I know you have been two

168
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,169
modalities have been to decide to have
been to Belkin you have been to DEFCON

169
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:04,720
you have been two other stuff so first
things we change that and the second

170
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,740
thing that we wrote actually the daniel
and I was just little bit taking the

171
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,190
coat it's dumping right Jason

172
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:20,340
change we get all the data that we can
get from the era dump and we get

173
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:26,269
something like this so we got this
Station make address MAC address first

174
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:32,200
time that we we have seen at last time
that we see and what kind of power LED

175
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:39,889
SSID which probes were sending out
manufacturer which kind of the phone so

176
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:47,979
we get this kind of output and we push
it to the elasticsearch

177
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,240
elasticsearch we change the
elasticsearch our environment we got the

178
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,850
data so now what is the same with a
Google you know when you open the Google

179
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:06,240
search field and if you don't know the
right question to ask to distilled

180
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,350
Sheen is still a dominant search engine
if you don't know the right questions to

181
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:19,539
ask so this is we have been in this kind
of situation somewhere in March so we

182
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:26,690
set up last week search we had a damper
spilling out spilling out all the data

183
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:35,929
pushing it to the to the Elks stack and
I what so it's time for the demo so we

184
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:41,059
have been somewhere we have been
somewhere in March we should be

185
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:42,250
somewhere here

186
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:49,000
so it seems we are getting is it visible
in the last row or not or should I

187
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,970
enlarge the font a little bit is it
better

188
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,180
ok so we are getting this kind of
information inside so this is actually

189
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:07,780
our original message here to see this is
the original message from Jason and then

190
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:15,500
the locks / purses its and elastic
sureste source everything that although

191
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:24,000
all these fields for easier search see
that we have the BSSID from maybe it's

192
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,710
that wireless access point we have wifi
name we have the manufacturer actually

193
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:39,230
does the phone we have their MAC address
so in March we have been like here is

194
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:53,640
that useful yes yes ok we have the data
now but we can create with cabana we can

195
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:01,730
create also the so-called dashboards so
you can have multiple visual elements on

196
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:09,090
it and to create with this visual
elements all the dashboard let's clear

197
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:16,040
this so this is the date of the last
hour I have been sitting here the

198
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:25,789
presentation from my previous speaker
and in the last hour so we have seen

199
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:37,070
57 different scid so from around here
around a neighbor to neighbor so 5775

200
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:43,049
actual physical access points why this
number is lower because you're gonna see

201
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:52,320
that welcome colin has several physical
wi-fi access points on only one fuckin

202
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,479
consid and we have seen around two
hundred and sixty different phones

203
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:04,909
tablets notebooks whatever devices that
were connecting or sending the packets

204
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:14,950
over the air so here we are also
gathering the data so open by far as BPA

205
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:20,599
BPA to who supports only BPA and we can
still have one web somewhere around us

206
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:27,229
so somewhere somebody could be cracking
it at that moment here you have the

207
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:33,389
names of the vital access points with
the strongest signals so ago somebody

208
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:41,320
with city hall style or something City
FL novice toria was near really near me

209
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:55,309
and then we can go drill down the top
clients welcome Khan had around maximum

210
00:22:55,309 --> 00:23:01,440
was around hundred and twenty people
were here so where is yellow and it's

211
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,239
not so we have around her one hundred
and twenty people here from last one

212
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:17,559
hour connected to the Belkin network
wireless network but normally be lower

213
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:21,549
little bit this number why because some
of some of the users they're using two

214
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:25,509
or three devices so somebody's maybe
with the phone with the tablet or

215
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:31,810
whether a bookplate let's say we have
around 100 people here so

216
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:38,720
the next fingers what kind of the point
when there is we have we have Pegatron

217
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:47,820
we have tp-link tp-link her way to
school complex and other route abort so

218
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:56,300
thick it's around us here we have the
number of the devices so phones tablets

219
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:03,040
and other things and we see that LG
Electronics six leading so it's very

220
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,330
good chance that most of the people are
using eg last year

221
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,879
last week I have been to the conference
in Germany Apple was winning here

222
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:24,310
appleOne lot of time here Apple is on
number three so mr Ryan house days

223
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:32,360
America ATM in Darmstadt Germany and it
was really funny if you try to run this

224
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:38,479
on Frankfurt Airport and I were a lot of
people running around you get the real

225
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:47,040
good real good numbers so you see that
we have I have seen around 25 devices

226
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:56,590
from Apple iPhones and iPads and
MacBooks I could end up let's say more

227
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:02,280
interesting part can be also here we
have been discussing this kind of probs

228
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:09,780
already here before so we see if I go
over this phone is quite a bit this

229
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:16,399
phone has quite a long history of save
wi-fi networks so easy that I know that

230
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:24,200
he has been going to doctors so he's I
guess he's getting gas and oil summer

231
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:34,060
using the telecom he's be connected to
Novi Sad billion of Christina I guess

232
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:41,010
that guys coming from serbia so

233
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:46,400
see his phone was sending out the 1616
the prob that the maximum number of the

234
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:55,110
props let's try with another one so this
one and overtaking us are so is yelling

235
00:25:55,110 --> 00:26:04,649
0:21 maybe this is maybe this is far
from Helena might be a dark wood ziegler

236
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,680
user summer so I should head on

237
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,880
might be if you if if you recognize that
your phone is sending this art piece

238
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,230
just raised a hand so let me see if I
could play

239
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:30,960
ok this one not but let me do la cosa I
don't know if this is what I but I guess

240
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,030
we're pretty close but let's see let's
see because I have been scanning this

241
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:44,750
also now for two days let's see if we
got some some even more phones with are

242
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:51,630
more props so we gonna go and see to
keep on a display for the last 48 hours

243
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:58,280
so let's see if somebody was sending
even more so

244
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:14,040
1317 guest you see this is a peoples in
Slovenia so there is a really good gas

245
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:20,310
the dead guys coming from Slovenia so
far has been at the conference besides

246
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:27,429
this year when we did organized it I
know that Cox Tuscany rooms this means I

247
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:36,520
bet he has been to either besides Las
Vegas or the desk or both maybe both

248
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:44,870
ok he's using Vodafone sprout Florida
hotel 22 Sun club

249
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:50,830
much just one is from serbia croatia or
something but I don't know what I know

250
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:55,179
what kind of the where he has been

251
00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:01,570
but not only days I can even take a look
I can take a look if I click on his Mac

252
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,309
let's see

253
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:13,790
and just take a look on his phone so
this is interesting I guess this is not

254
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:18,409
a phone but i guess its a notebook so he
has been connected to the notebook and

255
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:26,130
let's see he has not been playing are
captured the flak because he was not

256
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:33,650
connected to our capture deflect network
so this is everything with the point of

257
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:40,559
clicks no programming no nothing just
filtering displaying all this data ok we

258
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:56,240
have to clean we can also count the
number of the of the client on IDs so we

259
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,110
see that the maximum number of the
connected clients to the Belkin network

260
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:08,370
was 200 innate so that was the peak so
that i can assume that around 200 people

261
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:15,889
were here or at 303 I but the top moment
yesterday around noon around two o'clock

262
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:21,559
that was the peak when there are the
most clients ok we can we can go even

263
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:30,050
deeper so there is this church so you
can see that those are defiance they

264
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:35,760
have been connected anywhere so since
it's a hacker conference it's not really

265
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,550
safe to connect to the wifi right you
might get some issues but let's say we

266
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:48,490
want to eliminate this so we want to
ignore

267
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:58,450
ignored that part and now we got the
wifi when Mike Banas it's done we see

268
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:05,630
that's the number of the client saw the
biggest part was the 2k 15 that was the

269
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:12,340
most part that was that that network had
had the most of the of the users and can

270
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:20,280
somebody gas one yes I D and can you
guess how many physical access points

271
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:35,030
for the conference had 123456 so
actually this is this is a society and

272
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:40,889
these are the MAC addresses of the
access points is told

273
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:47,800
like this or summer down down below and
then you have great north side so a lot

274
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,740
of people has been connecting also and
here's our capture the flag so we know

275
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,950
we have been monitoring also the capture
the flag because we have been preparing

276
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:02,830
it so yeah the most number of the users
at the moment for capture the flag one

277
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:09,939
was thirty capture the flag 2002 we had
to have wireless access points was 21 so

278
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:17,510
we had the wrong 30 competitors and this
fits because we have like 33 registered

279
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:24,860
register players for the capture the
flag and if you go outside so we have

280
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:29,939
here yes it's lady so we have to make a
dress if you go outside then you have

281
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:35,980
then you have mac address of the phone
and you know that this phone that was

282
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:43,650
has been connected to our network was a
Samson so you can go and deep really

283
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:50,660
deep really deep dive really really deep
cervical for Kevin Falcon capture the

284
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,250
flag too so we see that we had

285
00:31:54,250 --> 00:32:00,780
only one access point and we had
different kind of users so that was with

286
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,860
tp-link I saw yesterday one guy from
Slovenia he was competing he had a

287
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:12,090
tp-link so I know that is that was his
computer that time so there have been

288
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:22,010
some apples apple algae tp-link LG Intel
my stuff so how do what do you think how

289
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:28,060
hard is make it is to make this kind of
the diagram if you have the data you

290
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:36,270
think its heart to have time to try it
out to make some kind of visualization

291
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:41,960
so you see that it's really easy let's
try to get some pie charts from a new

292
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:50,920
search we serve our wifi so what's a
point of interest we want to see the

293
00:32:50,920 --> 00:33:01,380
phone so the devices so we want to have
unique so unique account of station

294
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:07,150
maker also station McCarron this is in
this field to sexually the MAC addresses

295
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:19,700
of the old devices are stored in split
this whole bucket with a society's so

296
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:28,840
the way the names of the wireless access
points and be sure let's go 457 topmost

297
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:36,189
and we have few already ok these are
funds that they haven't been connected

298
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:42,800
to any network so this one is about
coming and this one is no beside capture

299
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:49,700
the flag want capture the flag to I'm
songs and was a so we can split now we

300
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:56,090
have this ladies we can go then
subpopulation and split this again

301
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:01,949
regarding the BSE I D so mecca dresses

302
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:09,849
for the physical physical physical
access points like this so we have 12345

303
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:17,379
for the for debugging so if we go here
we have a CCD Belkin calm and this one

304
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:24,810
has make a dress like here so the next
step is led try to get MAC addresses of

305
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:33,320
the France so we try to get this this is
the station maker oh ok we have wireless

306
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,079
name we have the Mac and we have the Mac
of the phone so the next step what we

307
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,770
are still missing let's see what kind of
manufacturer made that phone that we

308
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:53,089
have been on it so this one is
manufacturer or so let's say five apply

309
00:34:53,089 --> 00:35:02,180
and make little bit little bit more we
hired a legend so it's doesn't show show

310
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:08,049
everything so we have now we have seen
that some of the balcony was at that

311
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:17,579
time it had five different connection
this is intel on highly intelligent and

312
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:24,300
some other some other tools so we know
that this planet technology device with

313
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:32,970
this MAC address has been connected to
access point with this for CID CID no

314
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:39,680
such so was the heart if you have once
you have the data it was that hard at

315
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,560
all so it but there are plenty of
different different ways that you can

316
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,859
you can do it or you can how you can
visualize this this data of course you

317
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:56,930
have to have the data inside so if you
don't have data then even such a great

318
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:04,990
sport it won't help you lot down below
we also have you can create kind of life

319
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:10,078
strip so actually what is coming on
coming in so is he this is the date hour

320
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,240
1 minute ago

321
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:18,359
so this is the Belkin Kong Open Network
a network is sexually manufacturer and

322
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:24,230
obviously story are open network that's
actually its people ache so this is

323
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:29,400
coming from the wireless access points
in this one you have the you have the

324
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:35,880
clients so actually what kind of the new
clients have we seen in this is done

325
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:42,530
every 10 15 20 seconds depends from
europe your from your configuration but

326
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:52,330
not only do this if you go from from to
discovering you can also see this kind

327
00:36:52,330 --> 00:37:02,710
of stuff so you see since the network is
open sea since the network but the other

328
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:09,030
open you can actually get with you can
actually get the IP addresses of the

329
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:13,450
clients connected to the to the wifi
networks so you can do a little bit more

330
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:22,029
digging or you can do attacking and we
would have even more success if we would

331
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:28,300
be doing some nasty stuff like doubt
indication of the clients because that

332
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:37,270
time we would get blood of more moral
Probst sending out sending all to

333
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:48,859
getting in the sport so that the
creative creative parts creative style

334
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:55,590
that you can use you can use their Alec
Alec stack for the for the plane and you

335
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:01,150
see for the last few years we have well
my cart have seen around seven hundred

336
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:08,400
different phone devices so the people
common goal getting around staying

337
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,910
somewhere outside of the

338
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:19,250
of the conference so it was definitely
interesting dig into these data but of

339
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:25,230
course if you used to extract there are
definitely some problems the first his

340
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:34,339
job if you run Java since elasticsearch
lockstep in every run Java you have to

341
00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:46,150
have enough what memory exactly but it's
not always the problems just before

342
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:53,490
leaving for novice side I got the server
from eBay with 64 gigs of ram two times

343
00:38:53,490 --> 00:39:03,439
quad-core Opteron for like two hundred
and seventy euros so it's a daily with

344
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,579
12 base with this snow days just ran to
quote up two runs and I just installed

345
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:14,579
the elk steak and elasticsearch I can I
can share the details how is going to be

346
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:20,520
running so after we come home we gonna
feed all your packet or package that you

347
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,250
have your phone has been sending out
this last few days and we gonna play a

348
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,339
little better with that so definitely if
you want to play with it

349
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:33,880
Java and its might be a problem that's
why it's also a problem if you want to

350
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:40,950
run it on the Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi
model B has been one gig of ram but it's

351
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:44,549
doable there are some blog posts ok you
can sell you can do it for quick

352
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:53,250
analyzes the second problem is where to
run this ok if you're running at home

353
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:59,069
you don't get so many packets if Iran at
the conference like this it's more

354
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:05,579
interesting this is the Frankfurt
Airport from less we can't airports are

355
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:10,880
quite nice place to run this kind of
stuff because you can get millions of

356
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,810
packets and you can do analyzes later

357
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:21,420
so what we have seen with with with elk
its different filtering options we are

358
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,360
still discovering what a ban on the last
week search can offer because it has

359
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:33,280
really plenty of power you can do even
geolocation so we have IP addresses its

360
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,250
really with three clicks you can do
geolocation love the points no

361
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:45,540
programming and there are some crazy
ideas like if you're running inside your

362
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:54,480
tight your company you can do to use it
for both for the offensive and defensive

363
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,450
part so for defensive fighter is
definitely want to see what's actually

364
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:03,390
under what kind of the packets are
flying around and also for the defensive

365
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:08,759
part if somebody is connecting or
somebody is misusing divided by your

366
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:17,340
WiFi networks definitely you can using
an about-face one let's say one possible

367
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:24,810
way of using it it's also you can set up
a really kind of intrusion detection

368
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,930
system simple cheap

369
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:32,440
detection so if you know that you have
only 10 management people that are using

370
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:39,590
davai fire suddenly you have 20 users
and you get this on your dashboard then

371
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:44,590
there's something wrong or you can do
use it even further stalking so if you

372
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:48,880
know where somebody is going on if you
know where somebody's eating at which

373
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,770
restaurants because his phone is sending
all the props so you know which movement

374
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:58,740
where does he move you can do little bit
of tracking and I guess it would be

375
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:05,520
recreated idea and we have been now
before the starting this day we take a

376
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:13,150
walk until the river in order is really
highway if you set up on this highway

377
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:19,580
and maybe onto other highways lets a
small sensors you could actually track

378
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:24,500
when people's or even were coming and
sending all these data so it's it's

379
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:34,230
lot of possibilities ok before we wrap
up with the captured the flax winning

380
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:46,730
ceremony are there any questions
regarding to my talk I know people don't

381
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:55,510
ask questions but sorry there was
molested starch meet up with him at the

382
00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:01,030
lab so what are people interested in
this kind of area well you have my

383
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:06,250
contact you and I'll just meet me and we
had only two hours and a half from my

384
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:12,380
place where I live not a problem it's a
cool tool to stop and it's really easy

385
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:17,280
to use so you don't need like
programming skills like awesome for

386
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,720
people who don't know how to program yes
really powerful yeah it's really

387
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,649
powerful but you shouldn't get afraid
when you have all the data then it's

388
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:32,420
actually the work starts because you
have to have his relation and you have

389
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,700
you know actually have to know what
you're looking for

390
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:42,560
otherwise you'll always just big bunch
of data there it's still a bit bigger

391
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:48,560
but you don't have to program their all
functions to get the data folder it

392
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,720
because if everything out just click and
yeah yeah yeah it was just clicking I

393
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:59,500
didn't do anything and you can go
thrilled on EDD into the personal skills

394
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:12,720
ok other ok you said there is a
possibility for ideas actually was

395
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:19,629
thinking of the same idea about what
about a sim so candies they'd be fed to

396
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:24,150
us from us it can take some pressure
actions

397
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:29,060
sure you can be parsed and put some
routes and sides of the deluxe statue

398
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:33,600
have a lot of possibilities just getting
from same and putting out on the same so

399
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,520
lock / configuration is it's it's it's a
gradual rate way or you can write some

400
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:44,100
really short small Python scripts and
actually feeding the data into the semi

401
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:50,490
something going on actually the
elasticsearch company is also developing

402
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:55,810
depicted beat so it's actually the
analyzing the packets on a low level was

403
00:44:55,810 --> 00:45:00,990
kind of shocked and its leading directly
to the to the elasticsearch second just

404
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,500
within the interface in

405
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:08,140
and I want to monitor HTTP but this is
also another free so you have to have

406
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:13,650
the yeah but what you can do whatever
you want with this date are you can find

407
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,750
it for you can ship it to another one to
see him and he has connectors and just

408
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:29,220
sending out and it's because Jason so so
everything is Jason

409
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:34,600
ok then the last part one question

410
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,190
ok documentation

411
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:49,190
this what is this just drop an email
setting up the stage there is a lot of

412
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,940
the communication but sending this I can
give you a source court since it's not

413
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:58,970
till another repository of the quick but
I can help you or Daniel Ludwig gonna be

414
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:05,129
more than glad to help you but but it's
not step by step yet but it's gonna be

415
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,109
some

416
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:10,609
month or two is going to be on our
websites detailed description and

417
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:15,089
whatever you can do with that but before
I need to visit some other security

418
00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:26,630
conferences and then make those weapons
ok just the last just the last stuff who

419
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:30,760
has been doing CTF last two days

420
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:40,880
ok 12356 great so you had a lot of fun
was it fun yeah we tried to lead we try

421
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:47,359
we put a lot of effort in it so it was
like two weeks of hard work from Daniel

422
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:57,210
Shaw Daniel please give him big applause
hero he created so if us to heart then

423
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:12,150
blame him it was good I would get this
and yes finally got the winner so as you

424
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:21,990
can see pretty certain competitors
before we have when I hope when I have

425
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:27,680
been showing a result it actually around
30 IP addresses has been connected so

426
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,310
this number is real

427
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:36,369
we have some issues because somebody was
hacking our competition system and

428
00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:46,109
that's why that's why we have users like
this

429
00:47:46,109 --> 00:47:51,190
you sure fix this back because we said
we fix it and they proved we didn't fix

430
00:47:51,190 --> 00:48:00,249
it then this is our User we know what
you have salt so we have been deleting

431
00:48:00,249 --> 00:48:04,299
manually they're wrong submissions or
abuse

432
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:14,049
abuses but but in the end it you know
they have the same score so they have

433
00:48:14,049 --> 00:48:24,079
been working as a team they almost court
everything but we were giving out some

434
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:30,730
hands about how maybe to do it now
direct but they did really good job so

435
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:38,410
we got something for them so close
police come here and give him a big dick

436
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:47,828
give them a big applause so we had we
had now we have a problem because they

437
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:54,559
have been straight so you gonna have to
share somehow this is first price it's

438
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:59,880
actually affected by release but by
Western Digital so who's gonna gonna who

439
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:10,970
was the so you can do the park and the
other one goes the 32 gig so I can pick

440
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:16,640
up last because

441
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:22,670
they have been

442
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:32,059
machines running so they can do it after
IKEA workshop so you can imagine how to

443
00:49:32,059 --> 00:49:37,130
hack after several shots of rocky but
they managed a really good job so I'm

444
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:43,690
really glad because if they wouldn't
score so much let's see our time and our

445
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:49,359
investment into city have gone from
nothing but I think you did a really

446
00:49:49,359 --> 00:50:16,808
good job so hey there still missing the
last night but okay that's that's good

449
