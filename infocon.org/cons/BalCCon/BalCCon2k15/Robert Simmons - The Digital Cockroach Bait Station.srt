1
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:26,480
so my name is Rob and I want to
apologize about the the font I think

2
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,489
whatever PDF reader this is messed up
the fund a little bit but hopefully

3
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:37,309
every every slide will be readable so my
talk today as the digital cockroach bait

4
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:43,379
station and the point is to teach you
the basics of how to build spam honey

5
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,300
pots and then also go into a little bit
of information about what data you can

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,869
get from from spam and what information
you can get especially from headers and

7
00:00:54,869 --> 00:01:00,400
some somethings maybe you don't that are
not obvious that you can you can gain by

8
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:11,460
analyzing headers so who am I i work for
threat can act and this is a start up in

9
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:19,289
Virginia near Washington Dec and I'm
senior intelligence researcher I do

10
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,650
malware analysis and integrations and
just about anything that needs to be

11
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:30,490
done and this is my twitter handle down
here so follow me on Twitter when you

12
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:37,810
have a chance so what are the problems
here the main problem is that you need

13
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,990
to have more fresh malware samples you
need to have you know

14
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:51,289
fresh malicious links fresh advance fee
fraud if that's the type of threat that

15
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:59,850
you are working on and so the the goal
here is to take from all of these you

16
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:06,449
know different types of attacks phishing
attacks attacks gaining actionable

17
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:12,290
threat intelligence and gaining contacts
around what this particular attack that

18
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:17,920
you're looking at is what is probably
the purpose of the attack who the

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,589
adversary behind the attack is which
sometimes is difficult to determine but

20
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:32,069
all the ultimate goal is to give you
information about whether to pay more

21
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,969
attention to this particular attack if
you have one of your employees that has

22
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:41,090
clicked the link is this something that
you need to focus more attention on and

23
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,889
do damage control or is this something
that's just you know some sort of

24
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:49,930
unwanted program which you can you no
reform at their machine and then move on

25
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,150
its not something you know not Chinese
Apte or it's not you know some sort of

26
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:06,359
malware strain so I'm going to kind of
used to terms interchangeably

27
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:11,950
I think they're basically the same thing
so is spam trap and a spam honey pot I

28
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,559
will just use these terms
interchangeably but the idea of a spam

29
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:19,370
trap is a little bit older and

30
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,610
and has been around for years and years
and years but the idea of a spam trap

31
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:29,260
was more to collect spam on your mail
server and then you know at the same

32
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,790
time block just to be able to block the
spam but the purpose of what I'm talking

33
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:42,000
about here is sort of another advanced
stage of this type of honeypot wear what

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,909
you want to do is gather data out of it

35
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:50,159
about you know our boundaries malicious
links different types of attachments etc

36
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:58,720
so this is the definition that I have
spam traps this is from Wikipedia so

37
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,099
spam traps are usually email addresses
that are created not for communication

38
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:09,599
but rather to lure spam so my concept of
a spam honey pot still fits within this

39
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,959
older definition of spam trap but the
purpose is much more advanced than just

40
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:24,610
simply blocking the spam itself so I
kind of you know I want to relate this a

41
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,430
little bit because I have I have a
background in biology and so I like to

42
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,800
kind of bring a little bit of biology
into the sand and think of the

43
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:41,389
adversaries that I am working against as
cockroaches but not all of these are

44
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:49,210
cockroach traps each one of these type
of insect trap and this one you may

45
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:55,599
recognize that one is pretty traditional
cockroach trap but this one this is

46
00:04:55,599 --> 00:05:01,639
actually for catching flies Drosophila
flies or very small flies

47
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:08,050
this is a general this is a general trap
for most types of insects and then this

48
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,650
is another type of cockroach trap this
one is in my opinion absolutely

49
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:19,739
disgusting because it has what's called
Roche butter on it and so they eat the

50
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,270
rich butter and they take it back and
has poison in it they take it back to

51
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,469
their colony and then they you know the
ones that are around that Roach also

52
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,300
died and then

53
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:35,970
this one is probably the most advanced
of all of these traps this one is for

54
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:43,150
bed bugs the way it works it has a co2
cartridge and bedbugs actually are

55
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,789
attracted to your breath

56
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:49,969
that's how they find you at night so but
moving on from entomology or move back

57
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:57,520
to spam so I always want to make
everything that I work on very very very

58
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,430
simple I don't want to spend time
maintaining a large system that is

59
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,900
complex I want to make something that is
very very simple and I want to reuse

60
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,500
open source software that is already
been written and is solid and and

61
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:20,639
trusted so you can choose whatever mail
server you like to use but I prefer

62
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:28,159
using postfix I would not recommend
using something like send mail unless

63
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:32,710
you want to have a sendmail honey pot
with with the spam honey pot on top of

64
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:39,409
it but yeah if you use something like
post pics and then what you do is you

65
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:44,199
have a Python script and I will go into
the details of the Python script you run

66
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,020
the Python script so that every single
email that sent to this mail server is

67
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,729
parsed and has all of the headers
converted into JSON and then any of the

68
00:06:54,729 --> 00:07:00,469
attachments and any of the links that
are in the body are parsed out of it and

69
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:07,870
then all of this ends up being inserted
into an elastic search index and this

70
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:13,009
way you're able to do correlation among
different IP addresses as centers and

71
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:16,260
you can also do you know you can make
pretty graphs as well

72
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:24,039
so I want the red doesn't show up very
well in these slides I apologize but so

73
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,520
up here this is post pics so if you're
not familiar with postfix it's a general

74
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:38,580
generalist mail server software very
solid fairly secure and I personally

75
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,820
recommend running it on FreeBSD or
OpenBSD something where you don't have

76
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,140
to worry too much about the operating
system also being part of your honey pot

77
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:57,849
so JSON if you're not familiar with JSON
JavaScript object object notation and I

78
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:04,470
personally prefer JSON over XML and over
Yambol and the other different markup

79
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,550
languages

80
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,190
simply because it both it obviously it's
machine readable but if you if you

81
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:17,170
printed well with nice pacing human
beings can also read it so you can read

82
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,970
the data you can you can read the data
that's in that interchange format but

83
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:29,470
XML I just I i cant read XML it's almost
illegible because it's it's too busy and

84
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,540
then elasticsearch you know it's up to
you if you want to use a different type

85
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:39,120
of database to store your data that's up
to you there's MongoDB there's other

86
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,910
types of no sequel but I prefer
elasticsearch simply because it's very

87
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:51,100
very very easy very easy to set up it's
very easy to use and all of all of the

88
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:57,690
text searching and access to
elasticsearch is via RESTful API so it's

89
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:06,750
it it goes over the same protocols as
all the rest API's so the mail server

90
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:12,020
configuration again you know we're going
for simple you want to accept all email

91
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,560
from any domain even if the demand that
you have that pointing to this

92
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,780
particular server is a different domain
if someone is going to send you spam

93
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,680
you don't want to rejected for any
reason even if it's for the wrong

94
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,689
man wrong wrong sender anything so you
want to accept all usernames and you

95
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,589
want to accept any domain but one thing
that's very important is that you want

96
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:40,060
to prevent having a balanced message
sent back out you don't want to run a

97
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,219
spam honey pot and have you you're
attracting all sorts of spam coming in

98
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,339
and you don't want to waste time sending
bounce messages back to all of the is

99
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:55,670
probably nonexistent email addresses and
from addresses etcetera and so you

100
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:00,860
basically want to block all outbound
mail and essentially one of the things

101
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:06,440
that I've done on my spam honey pots is
on top of configuring the mail server to

102
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,339
not send bounce messages or any sort of
return message at all I make sure that

103
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:18,459
the host based firewall on the p.m.
blocks all outbound traffic on those

104
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:23,170
certain ports that guaranteed not to
make any mistakes even if there's like a

105
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:28,260
Miss configuration I'll stick it still
will not send something out that I don't

106
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:34,360
want it to so this is just you know
anything at anything that's what you

107
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:41,080
want to accept so what i do is i process
all of the inbound email with a custom

108
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,029
Python scripts and just as a backup
because you know for for any reason the

109
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:51,380
elasticsearch cluster is unreachable and
you can't send your data they're going

110
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,880
to have another copy of it because you
know you might miss one thing that's

111
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,029
very important so you want to make sure
that you keep a local copy on on the

112
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,860
mail server on the spam honey pot for a
period of time before you know so that

113
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:11,450
you can go back and we parse your
messages if something messes up in in in

114
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:18,079
your in your storage and database so
this is just a recommendation and

115
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,099
actually if if python is not your
language you can you could use any

116
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,890
language at all because it's very very
simple simple what I'm doing here

117
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:32,520
basically parsing each one of the header
fields in bikini value pairs and then

118
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,720
say you know basically X and then
exporting that

119
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:43,170
as a JSON file and then the body and the
at the body also as one you know key

120
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:48,709
body and then the value is the text of
the body and then also just as a second

121
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:56,949
you know so that there's a single text
blob I also save header as a key and

122
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:01,050
then the entire header not broken up
just exactly as it is in the in the

123
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:09,229
message as another key value pair so I
prefer Python three point four you know

124
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:14,339
there's certain times where I have to
use Python too but I tried to move away

125
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,769
from Python for anything new

126
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:23,069
so and then like I said that translates
all of the emails into JSON format and

127
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:31,040
then exports them and saves them into
index in elasticsearch so good this is

128
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,279
this is kind of a very busy slide but
we're gonna spend a lot of time on this

129
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:42,980
one because it's very important to know
what data you can get from spam and I

130
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:48,019
apologize if you can't read it all read
it out to you but so one of the

131
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:53,519
important things that you can get is
from the date time zone so if you have

132
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,149
legitimate email coming from you know
eastern standard time in the United

133
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:03,430
States chances are that's coming from
mail server that you

134
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:08,130
you might not trust but at least you
know that it's in the United States but

135
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,500
if you have an email

136
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:18,630
invalid and the the timezone is that a
No in China or in europe you know you

137
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,790
you might actually put maybe you know if
you have some sort of filtration you

138
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,140
might put a you know a +1 as far as like
suspicious Ennis of this particular

139
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:35,089
piece of email so especially you can
find you know information about where

140
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:40,720
that mail server or or the botnet or
wherever it thinks it's sending from you

141
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,300
can get some small amount of information
from the timezone itself so pay

142
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:55,880
attention to the time zone spf so these
next two SPF and DTM these are important

143
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:04,700
said D cam is domain keys and SPF both
SPF and decamped our methods of blocking

144
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,200
spam so they are there a way to verify
whether the sender of this particular

145
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,440
email is who they say they are and is
coming from the demand that they say

146
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,089
they're coming from so in this case it's
good to it's good to find this

147
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:27,990
information you can find the forged you
can find forged EMPs also the SPF if you

148
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:37,370
see spf fail pay more attention to that
particular pieces so another thing this

149
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:43,240
is this is something that is a little
bit that might not be as obvious as the

150
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:53,730
other components here so the e EHL Oh or
a cello string this is during the SMTP

151
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,459
handshake when you know when one mail
server or a mail client is speaking to a

152
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:05,140
mail server it makes a connection on
port 25 and then it goes through an SMTP

153
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:11,439
handshake so the first thing it does is
it says hello or a cello and then it

154
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,160
says it's domain is supposed to be

155
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:22,189
so if for example you know I am a male
client and I'm telling the truth I'm not

156
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,690
like a misconfigured mail client I'm not
doing anything malicious

157
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:33,930
what I would do is if if my mail client
is configured to be at you know Rob at

158
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:42,479
example.com lho would say lho
example.com the domain that I'm telling

159
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,089
the mail server that I'm coming from so
this one is actually interesting because

160
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:51,560
let's say that you have a particular
botnet which is standing out you know

161
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,989
thousands and thousands thousands of
pieces of spam

162
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,589
there's only two things that it can do
it's not going to tell the truth so it's

163
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:03,509
not going to be no its not going to give
you it's true domain because it doesn't

164
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:07,980
actually have a specific domain but
there's two things that can do it will

165
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,310
have either similar to a demand
generation algorithm like the ones that

166
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:19,180
you see for.net situ where the callback
to demand generation algorithm so to

167
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:25,859
have a similar type of algorithm just
generating random or some random domains

168
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,880
or it will just be configured to say the
same thing over and over the same like

169
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:38,120
hardcoded lho string so you can key off
of that and you can for some types of

170
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,149
botnet you can identify that particular
operator of the bottom because of the

171
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:48,949
way that they have configured it and so
this is actually an indicator of that

172
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:56,250
particular type of delivery method so
that one is pretty interesting also

173
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:04,150
obviously the originating IP originating
IP is not always the source you could

174
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:10,120
have open relays you can have sometimes
even have a male sorry a web server and

175
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:15,270
the web server is compromised in the web
service actually sending out spam or

176
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:22,459
reeling spam from botnet the pit like a
PHP similar to a PHP back door but a PHP

177
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,650
based mailer

178
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:29,180
if you do if your if you maintain
websites and you have like a compromise

179
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:35,310
WordPress site you've probably seen this
type of Mahler before so what you can

180
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:41,899
get from the originating IP obviously
you can get network who is GeoIP ASN who

181
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:47,120
is and then also this is one that is
that some people don't paid close

182
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,520
attention to but there's our who is so
an ISP will reassign of block of IP

183
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,200
addresses to maybe a hosting provider
and so the hosting providers information

184
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:04,020
is found in the car who is data so if
you need to contact someone to report

185
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:13,460
abuse often you can get the the more
specific information from our who is so

186
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,220
the next one

187
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:20,160
reply to reply to is interesting for
certain types of scams that you would

188
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,180
see in in spam

189
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:33,120
so specifically these are important very
important in advance fee fraud so these

190
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,219
are the sorts of things where you know
the Nigerian prince is sending you one

191
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:42,750
million dollars as long as you send the
Nigerian Prince $100 now this sort of

192
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:50,900
thing that type of adversary needs to
receive your reply so they don't forge

193
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:56,270
the information here in reply to this is
usually a live address and so you can

194
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,800
use that as an indicator if you're
collecting a set of threat intelligence

195
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,080
so this can be an indicator that you
want to to to save and also you can

196
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,199
correlate across different attacks and
follow patterns as adversaries typically

197
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,730
use their same you know same set of
email address or same style of email

198
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:21,400
addresses over and over and over the
subject subject interesting the subject

199
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,190
this is interesting in certain ways but
you know when I get down here to this

200
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:31,190
when I talk about the same hash the
that's where the subject will become

201
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,750
more important

202
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,600
but the subject by itself is until we
get down here and I explained this the

203
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,689
subject is not necessarily that
important at this point the from address

204
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:48,550
this is typically forged you know you
during the SMTP handshake you can type

205
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:53,159
as long as you're as long as that mail
server they are sending the spam to is

206
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,830
maybe misconfigured are not configured
very strictly the from address can just

207
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,270
be anything anything you want you can
type in whatever you want

208
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:08,220
so the from address not necessarily
something that you want to keep as a

209
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,800
specific indicator of a live email
address that you may want to track but

210
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,570
it can be it can be used to correlate
across different different attacks you

211
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:23,939
can also see you even see if someone is
trying to attack your company you might

212
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:30,850
even see the from address being an email
address at your company so then the

213
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,139
envelope sender this is a little bit
different than the from address this is

214
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:41,620
so when when you have an SMTP session
and the connection goes through the LA

215
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:47,610
show at the beginning and then it says
receipt to and mail from so the mail

216
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:53,290
from the email address that is put into
mail from is found here in the envelope

217
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:59,960
sender so this is this can be forged
also but it's actually a diff it can

218
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,740
even be a completely different address
than the from because from is actually

219
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:11,470
when new when you go past the the mail
from in the receipt to the next step you

220
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,680
enter data and so the from the from
address is actually part of the data

221
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:26,880
section of an SMTP connection so so
return path this is not not necessarily

222
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,650
an important for me in this stuff but
this part so X mailer and the mail URL

223
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:38,070
this is very very very interesting so
when you have a compromised website

224
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:43,110
and the compromised website is being
used to send spam

225
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:51,090
one of two things can happen one is the
the PHP mailer that's being used that

226
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,520
has been inserted into the the
compromised website as being used to

227
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,150
relay the spam if the spammer doesn't
configure it properly it will actually

228
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:09,730
record its own path on that mail server
in this X mailer field in the header so

229
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:17,900
if you want to do some sort of take down
on that particular you know spam stores

230
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:24,310
you can actually figure out exactly the
file on the server that is that has been

231
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,570
inserted into the server so you can call
the you know hosting company or the

232
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,340
website owner and say you know hey not
only take this file off clean up your

233
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,429
stuff but also can you send me a copy of
this file I want to see like what the

234
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:42,530
configuration is inside you know what
the the PHP code is for it so the next

235
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:49,960
part down here this is another not so
obvious but very interesting header

236
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,580
component so the mime boundary string
them I'm boundary string when you have

237
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:02,360
different types of data in the body of
an email they all have a mime boundary

238
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:07,030
string around them unless the email is
just plain text if it's plain text there

239
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,070
won't be any mind boundary strings but
if you have HTML or if you have an

240
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,230
attachment

241
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:17,700
you'll have a mime boundary string on
both sides of that different type of

242
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:23,690
data and if you look to the mind
boundary string is typically a random or

243
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,350
semi random string of characters but
again because that is you know

244
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,860
you have a botnet and the botnet is just
generating spam

245
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,949
chances are that botnet is the
generating the spam is not using you

246
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:46,620
know clean good email client code that's
going to generate normal you know a

247
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,059
regular mind boundary string it's going
to generate either the same mind

248
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:55,539
boundaries string over and over for a
lot of emails or it will use one that

249
00:23:55,539 --> 00:24:02,169
has a certain pattern and so this
becomes its own indicator the origin of

250
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:05,360
that particular piece of spam

251
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:12,000
ok now we get down to some hash so this
is this is something that is that I'm

252
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,210
working on right now it's still in the
still in sort of the theoretical area

253
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:25,809
but some hash is one of the two I know
of two algorithms that do piecewise

254
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:30,940
fuzzy hashing so piecewise fuzzy hashing
is something that's used extensively and

255
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:39,230
malware research and what it is you take
you know you take a blob of data and you

256
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,750
break it up into certain known pieces
and then you take hashes of the pieces

257
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:49,020
and then when you have to let's say two
files that have had a piecewise fuzzy

258
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:54,760
hash you can compare them and see how
different they are from each other and

259
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,140
if you know one part of it is is
slightly different but then this whole

260
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,710
areas the same you know the distance
between those two files will be very

261
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:10,450
close so there's two there's two
different to different types of

262
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:15,530
piecewise for the action that I'm aware
of what is called sim hash and some hash

263
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:21,350
is actually a algorithm which is
targeted towards text so it's it's

264
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:26,689
sufficient for looking at two pieces of
text and seeing how different or how or

265
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:32,870
how similar they are and then the other
type is called S O S S deep and if you

266
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,070
do our research you probably heard of
SSD deep it's more

267
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:42,509
it's more tuned for looking at the
difference between two binary files

268
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:49,340
right so the thing that I'm the thing
that I'm working on is to take a SIM

269
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:55,840
hash of certain header fields such as
the from address such as the the

270
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,720
subjects reply to things that are going
to be indicators you know things that

271
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,190
are going to be indicators of possibly
you know the origin of this of the spam

272
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:11,299
and then take the same hash of each
one's each one of these and you know in

273
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:15,889
theory I should be able to get a
basically a distance and a similarity

274
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:21,258
between one email and another email and
see you know in and be able to use that

275
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:26,820
in an automated way if I have this
particular you know don't open the door

276
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:33,379
please open this fax you know and has an
attachment if if the set of header

277
00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:39,490
fields after I've run it through some
hash is close enough I can also say hey

278
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:44,169
this other email that's not necessarily
asking about the facts might be closely

279
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:47,980
related to this one because of some of
the similarities in the header so I can

280
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:54,500
you know perhaps use this to block it on
a mail server or just do it to to to

281
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:03,830
find you know texas's of different
attacks so that's a that's that's it for

282
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:10,529
the header and then this is over here
this is this is all the information not

283
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:14,110
all of the information but these are
some of the major components and

284
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:19,039
information that you can get from the
body of the email so again

285
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,679
advance fee fraud attacks use phone
numbers embedded in the email that's one

286
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:30,149
of the ways they get you to contact them
from from my experience a lot of these

287
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:35,178
are VoIP numbers that are pointing to
another number so that when they get

288
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:40,269
taken down they can just roll it to the
next one the next most prevalent from

289
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:46,940
that is probably cell phones but most of
the time it's icy avoid numbers in here

290
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:53,060
and then of course the attachment
attachment can be either you know it

291
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:59,629
could be any number of things and maybe
a base 64 encoded HTML it could have a

292
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:05,820
job it could have a javascript attack
buried in the attachment it could be a

293
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:11,570
binary it could be any number of things
also you can get a Ural if you've got a

294
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:16,129
drive-by attack or if you just have like
a regular download some you know I've

295
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:22,660
seen many many many many malware attacks
where the the the the URL is just a file

296
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,600
click and download the file and then
it's you know it the instructions in the

297
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:32,070
email please run this year please open
this and it sometimes the fire will be

298
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,050
like JPG

299
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:43,639
exe or or PDF exe or something like this
and it works I mean it it's amazing it

300
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:50,570
still works but it does work and then I
down here I have listed to two types of

301
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:56,050
same hash that I take of the body and
the reason for this I just called this

302
00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:02,480
rendered some hash and the reason for
this is some emails will have planned

303
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,050
tax and then in another between another
mine roundtree they'll have an HTML with

304
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:13,180
like all the pretty graphics and fonts
and all that crap so what I want to do

305
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:19,320
is not necessarily take a SIM hash that
includes all of the HTML so what I uses

306
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,050
beautiful soup you can use any type any
type of scraper software but I use

307
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:29,230
beautiful soup to just remove all of the
HTML tags and then after I removed all

308
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:37,080
the HTML tags then I take the same hash
of the remaining the remaining data and

309
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,889
then obviously you can get an email
address and then the text of the body so

310
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,180
this is just an overview of some of the
different things that you can get from

311
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:54,700
an email and you know I already talked
about elasticsearch so now this is the

312
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,750
this is the part where you

313
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:03,260
alright I'm sorry this these were these
are actually cockroaches those were bed

314
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:07,440
bugs but I guess the the the the the
picture didn't come through on this

315
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:14,060
laptop I apologize but this is where you
want to first of all register a domain

316
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:20,800
another option is to go and look there's
you know there's many many many domains

317
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:26,180
squatting sites that want to sell you
old demands so you can some of them you

318
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:31,600
can rank the domain by its age and so
who cares what the domain is I wanted

319
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,179
domain that's been out there for 20
years just existing for twenty years

320
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:41,960
because it will attract more spam than
others but one thing that's important

321
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,330
after you after you have registered your
domain

322
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:50,220
make sure if you're going to register it
make sure to turn on demand privacy or

323
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:58,210
whatever thing that particular registrar
provides or just put fake information in

324
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:05,190
there must cancel your domain for a year
and still someone complains about it now

325
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,960
the next step is to configure DNS
there's a couple of nuances here for

326
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,550
configuring your DNS it's very important
to make sure that you don't have only

327
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:20,510
one IP address because you're trying to
simulate a real mail server in a real

328
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:26,020
male environment in the real enterprise
in a company so no company has 11 IP

329
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,690
address for their mail service they have
a set of IP addresses for the mail

330
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:33,520
server referring to different ones so
make sure you assign at least three IP

331
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,010
addresses you can pretend because the
the mail server you can only you only

332
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:44,870
have to set up one spam honeypot 11 mail
server for this but a sign 33 different

333
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:49,409
IP addresses at least to that server so
that you simulate a real environment

334
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:58,170
also create a primary and to backup host
names have all of them male one-dot male

335
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,630
one example.com mail to

336
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:07,380
not example.com and Mail 3 etcetera also
simulating a real male environment so

337
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:13,080
that it looks right now this last when
this is actually the one that's very

338
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,060
nuanced so you want to have three or
more

339
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:22,760
DNS MX records and you want to have
differing priorities set to those MX

340
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,480
records we're going to look at a slide
in a minute that shows this but the

341
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:34,760
reason for this is sometimes the main
your primary mail server is where you

342
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:42,060
have things like antivirus or some sort
or you're running spam filters and the

343
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:47,669
protection that you have is on the on
your primary mail server your secondary

344
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:53,330
mail server or tertiary mail server
sometimes will have no spam filtration

345
00:32:53,330 --> 00:33:02,290
no AV and so i've seen a lot of spammers
will send only to the higher priority MX

346
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:07,899
records and they will they will
specifically on purpose not send to your

347
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,770
primary mail server because they're
hoping that the primary mail server

348
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:17,020
trusts mail that's coming from the
secondary and the secondary has no spam

349
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:22,650
protection on it so make sure you have
three DNS MX records so that you catch

350
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:27,120
you catch that extra spam and you catch
those other people that are targeting

351
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,370
you know lower priority MX

352
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:37,610
mail servers so now you need to generate
email addresses to see them out to all

353
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,570
of the world's ended everywhere get it
on every single list and everything but

354
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:46,250
what you wanna do is you can see them on
your own website put them in you know

355
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,780
put them in metadata put them all over
the place

356
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,270
give them to your friends have your
friends help seed when they you know

357
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:57,910
write a comment on some website just
have them put the ring this random email

358
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,900
address like in the bottom of their
comment you know why not

359
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:07,550
but the important part here when you're
seeding email addresses out is

360
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:12,719
maintained either a spreadsheet or
database or something so that you know

361
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,638
where the email address went where you
put it

362
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,389
what date you put it there and you know
maybe who you gave it to have someone

363
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:25,360
else is going to see it for you so that
you know alright this place

364
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:30,870
generates this type of spam so you can
correlate where that email address was

365
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:35,659
seeded with the type of attacks on the
type of spam that come into that

366
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:43,100
particular email address so when you're
registering to demand sorry this doesn't

367
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,960
actually didn't didn't wrap properly
with this with this PDF reader I

368
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,030
apologize but there's many free services
out there for registering domains and

369
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:56,169
they will even let you have gmail email
service on them

370
00:34:56,168 --> 00:35:01,660
the adversary uses these you know like .
TK and stuff like this why can't we use

371
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:07,290
the same services so just make sure that
you protect your identity by using free

372
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,529
email services

373
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:14,670
burner you know basically burner emails
and protect yourself with domain

374
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:22,950
registration DNS service and before you
begins eating before you begin seeding

375
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,580
anything out into the world and trying
to collect

376
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:31,470
spam look very carefully at your own who
is information look very carefully at

377
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:35,160
your DNS records look at it very
carefully and see if you made a mistake

378
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,819
and you're leaking any information about
yourself if you left your name or if you

379
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,570
have registered the domain and you
forgot to turn on who is privacy or

380
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:47,800
something like this and you know there's
some identifying information about you

381
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,430
you want to make sure thats not there
before you begin sending stuff out to to

382
00:35:53,430 --> 00:36:00,509
attract adversaries and also this is
something that's very very important on

383
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:06,580
the spam honeypot itself there is pretty
good chance that at some point this

384
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:13,069
server will get popped by someone right
so you don't want to have the admin or

385
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:17,220
the user name that you're logging into
the spam honey pot as your you know your

386
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:21,129
hacker handle you don't want to have you
don't want to have any trace of anything

387
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:25,690
on there just call it something boring
like you know user one and an admin one

388
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:30,100
so that there's no there's no trace of
of anything that if someone pops your

389
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,420
spam honey pot they could possibly
figure out who you are and information

390
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:42,900
about that also with things like logs
it's up to you when I when I set up my

391
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:49,230
spam honey pots the author logs and
incoming IP address logs are all set to

392
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:54,770
Dev know if the if the box gets popped
it makes it a little bit more difficult

393
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,900
for someone to figure out where where
I'm coming from

394
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:06,200
so make your username on the new server
very generic it didn't work

395
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:15,830
ok so this was a screenshot of the DNS
records for a example spam honey pot I

396
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:20,080
apologize this light doesn't work if any
by the way if anybody wants the slides

397
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,840
just come tell me afterwards I'll give
you a copy of the slides I got them here

398
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:30,670
in PDF and you should be able to if you
read if you look this look at this you

399
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:34,100
know in a different PDF reader you
should be able to see this this example

400
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,819
slide so

401
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:41,550
now you know you have to sometimes have
a little fun when you're doing the sort

402
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,630
of things when you're generating the
email addresses you want to generate

403
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,000
email addresses some of them you might
want to generate them that are just

404
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,290
random whatever but all the other ones
you might want to have something that

405
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:58,870
looks real you know real names real
names for companies in this sort of

406
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:07,819
thing so have fun with it so these are
just a few sites that I use to generate

407
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:16,410
the names so I have you know behind the
name random random name generator name

408
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:21,470
mesh and these two are you serious
interesting because they make they just

409
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:26,330
they they they spit out random generic
company names if you want to make a

410
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:30,029
domain name that's you know based on
something that sounds like a real

411
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:35,720
company just have have this make a
couple of random names another thing

412
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:41,470
scrabble word scrabble word finder deal
if you like Scrabble you can increase

413
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:45,959
your Scrabble knowledge at the same time
as you're making fake email addresses by

414
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,340
looking through all the scrabble word
finder Xin than memorizing the words

415
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:53,340
that you're using there and just
creating email addresses with it and

416
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,960
then anagram solvers put in a word and
then find all the different anagrams for

417
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,740
it and then creating mode email
addresses for that so now you have spam

418
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:10,549
and the sorry this this slide also had a
picture it had a picture of probably my

419
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:15,980
favorite piece of spam I've ever seen
and believe me come come get the PDF of

420
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:25,070
this it actually has a malicious link
where it ends in main PHP and then it

421
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:31,970
has a big ass key like finger clicking
the link and it's awesome

422
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:37,140
by paula jones' the PDF reader on this
machine is not not the best but

423
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:45,299
thank you this is this is the company's
blog where we publish research this is

424
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:50,288
my twitter handle and then this is our
company to order handle so please come

425
00:39:50,289 --> 00:40:00,960
check us out and follow me and if we
have any questions what is generating

426
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,900
mailbox names over using a Cattrall
mailbox

427
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:10,039
what is the adventures of generating
mailbox names on the honey pot over

428
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:15,269
using a catch-all mailbox so so the
question is what is the what is the

429
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:20,140
benefit of generating a set of email
addresses over just having a spam honey

430
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:25,319
pot that that catches everything so you
do want to always have a spam

431
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:29,839
the underlying spam honey pot is that it
catches everything but the reason why

432
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,960
you would generate I mean generating the
random ones is not the important thing

433
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,059
it's that you have a specific email
address that you have succeeded in one

434
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:44,500
specific location so you know that if
something is sent to this particular

435
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:51,089
email address you know where you see did
it and you know perhaps some information

436
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:56,029
about how the how the adversary is is
getting there are gathering their email

437
00:40:56,029 --> 00:41:03,819
addresses could also you said that you
log when you needed that email address

438
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:07,509
to a certain form or whatever to gather
spam

439
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:11,539
you could also log that the email
address it would still show up in the

440
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:17,539
log of the catch-all email address that
the email that you so I'm now I'm not

441
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:26,509
following you if you wait so you're
saying you know I think there might have

442
00:41:26,509 --> 00:41:32,839
been a misunderstanding so I'm when I
say generate email addresses all I mean

443
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,950
is generate the text of the email
address

444
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:41,230
nothing on the spur nothing on the
server that yeah the catch the catch all

445
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:45,599
will catch all that well I'm gonna ya
what i'm saying generating an email

446
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,200
address I'm just saying you know use
those tools to generate a list of email

447
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,399
addresses that you put in your
spreadsheet or database so that you can

448
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,279
correlate that with the spam that's
coming in that's what I meant thanks

449
00:41:57,279 --> 00:42:08,569
sure well first of all thank you for
interesting presentation I have a

450
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:13,519
feeling that this is only one half of
the story right so you have a built-in

451
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:20,669
system which which is pretty elaborate
can track where you've sent to cede it

452
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:28,900
addresses to what parts are used to
harvest those addresses now what I would

453
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:40,039
be interested in what most legal do you
have a teacher on the disposal to

454
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:47,549
actually do something about it basically
you are harvesting a lot of dictating

455
00:42:47,549 --> 00:42:54,190
formation about spammers somebody might
say so what do with it

456
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:58,750
ok so this is a good question so one
once you've gathered your spam

457
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:02,410
what can you do with it what what
purpose do you have for gathering this

458
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:11,859
so there's many different purposes here
but I'll talk about one so specifically

459
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:19,808
if there is a new a new attack actually
not even get I will give you a specific

460
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:26,930
use case so after the hack after hacking
team was popped everybody remembers that

461
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:32,538
two months ago hockey team was popped
and then they had a a set of flash days

462
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:38,480
that were being weaponized first the
first one that I found that weaponized

463
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:44,109
it was an angler ek and then you know
rig exploit kit and all the other

464
00:43:44,109 --> 00:43:48,740
exploit kits also used it but there was
also an apt group

465
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:55,299
which is known by the name wet be so the
wet be apt group began using that

466
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:04,930
particular / exploit weaponize from from
the hacking team disclosure and so they

467
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:13,310
began sending that out just as a you
know a shotgun blast via spam and that's

468
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:19,890
how I caught that so you know the the
way that I dunno gathered the data 222

469
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:25,900
then look at the flash file you know
reverse it into action scripts find out

470
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:31,140
what it's the payload binary is that
it's delivering all of this I gained

471
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,819
that knowledge by having a spam honeypot
working and and catching that to begin

472
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:45,950
with are you also employing something
like legal things is it something you

473
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:53,899
can do in this global world is it is
running a spam honeypot let's let's

474
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:59,230
change so let's let's let's change that
question slightly instead of is it legal

475
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:05,900
let's ask the question is it illegal not
to my knowledge is it illegal so no my

476
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:11,410
question was not about you being legal
but when once to track down somebody can

477
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:20,149
you take legal actions think that's
doable let's say so after you know after

478
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,720
you've developed a

479
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:29,430
you know a set of threat intelligence on
a particular attack and then from that

480
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:35,348
sort of threat intelligence may be over
quite a bit of time you were able to

481
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:42,090
perhaps an adversary their persona
emerges from you know from your analysis

482
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:49,830
of this data typically I did you know
it's it's difficult to to do something

483
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:53,930
legally against that entity they're
typically in a different country than

484
00:45:53,930 --> 00:46:02,210
the us- however it's still very very
important to know that information so

485
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:08,349
that you're so that your security team
and your company can make a decision as

486
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:13,640
to whether this adversary is very
capable or whether they're just you know

487
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,910
some script kiddie that doesn't have a
whole lot of knowledge and is not

488
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:24,140
specifically targeting you so you'd be
able to divide your attacks between you

489
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:29,330
know just typical crime where and then
something that's a targeted attack

490
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:35,819
against you and so therefore you're able
to not necessarily go after that

491
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:41,010
adversary or that group but you're able
to make an educated decision as to

492
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:45,710
whether you need to pay more attention
to what just happened on your network or

493
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:59,279
if you can just use regular procedures
and and move on you know thank you

494
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:06,259
first of all thanks for very interesting
presentation I really like that I have a

495
00:47:06,259 --> 00:47:14,949
question have you ever thought of making
your honey pot as an openly with one

496
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:21,659
option is to limit connections which
coming from outside the wall to your

497
00:47:21,659 --> 00:47:25,769
server to prevent exhaustion and the
same time

498
00:47:25,769 --> 00:47:31,439
prevent reflected in our service attack
but it may be a good idea to be

499
00:47:31,439 --> 00:47:37,229
intermediate being one in the middle
between the attacker better than being

500
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:47,999
the receiver I hadn't thought about that
but definitely we will talk thanks yeah

501
00:47:47,999 --> 00:47:54,158
I think that's a good idea anymore
questions all right thank you very much

502
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:54,959
everybody thank you
