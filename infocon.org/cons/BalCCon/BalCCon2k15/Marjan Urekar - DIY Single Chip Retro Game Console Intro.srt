1
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,950
hello everyone

2
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:28,410
the title of this store keys is
basically introduction to the workshop

3
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,340
which will be tomorrow it's about
electronics in building a game console

4
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:52,000
so let's let's hear what about basic
stuff you need to know

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:08,880
project by our distinguished one chip
game controller here and my man idea was

6
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:17,090
that most of you guys are softer based
and may be lacking some basic knowledge

7
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:25,740
in hardware so I'll try to explain some
basic stuff you need to know in order to

8
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,339
build this controller this controller is
it yourself

9
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,399
kind you get there

10
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:43,300
printed circuit board parts and you need
to assemble its older it and operated on

11
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:54,050
how it's done so this is the link to the
build this is how the world looks

12
00:01:54,050 --> 00:02:01,110
exactly like this it's small compact and
neatly designed

13
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:09,869
this is the one game it contains it's
based on jump all the jumping jack game

14
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:19,100
this is what you need to do in order to
get this console working PCB truck parts

15
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:26,320
sold the richest template tested before
playing it and you can have fun and play

16
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:34,310
with it later so this is the beginning
this is so called printed circuit board

17
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:40,500
this is where all the parts go and you
need to solder is your parts to this

18
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:50,370
board on the first picture you get top
layer of dispute 26 board it had built

19
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:57,140
screen with all the competence and this
is where competence are placed this is

20
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:03,109
the bottom of the circuit board and this
is where you solder your components

21
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:12,230
don't mix it and this is the list of
parts will be using to assimilate

22
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:18,149
resistors capacitors resistors diodes
courts integrated circuits push buttons

23
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:25,680
and connectors I'll talk about each
topic if you are getting your own parts

24
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:34,230
you must know to get through so-called
to whole parts not small S&D components

25
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:41,709
they are very tricky to be soldered and
this board is

26
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:49,620
whole parts will talk about what

27
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,550
fortunate to use because part where we
mark

28
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:04,540
typename and package so you have to be
very careful about that we'll see what

29
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:14,440
what goes where and don't Russia you
need time to build it so don't go too

30
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,430
fast especially if you're not
experienced so first topic are the

31
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:29,570
resistors these are small resisted
components they are marked with colors

32
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:37,740
their value resistance is marked with
four or five bands of colors they all

33
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:45,830
have standard standardized values will
talk about tolerance each resistor has

34
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:53,150
some tolerance so this is the example if
you get hundreds

35
00:04:53,150 --> 00:05:03,130
resistor with 5% tolerance the real
resistance is summer from 95 to 100 and

36
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:10,440
50 homes if you get more precise
resistor will get smaller variance and

37
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,790
this resistors are more expensive you
can use two types of resistance cut

38
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:24,000
carbon film and metal film cover film
our older they have a larger tolerance

39
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,720
5% more during metal films are at or 1%
so very precise metal film are usually

40
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,360
blue in color and

41
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,259
carbon film either some brownish color
you can distinct them you can use some

42
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:49,770
of them you can mix them it's not
critical in this build and this is a

43
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:59,099
nightmarish look on how the resistors
are color-coded you need to know that in

44
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:10,779
order to place the correct resistor in
each designated place what you need to

45
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:19,699
know there is a table each color is
connected to one number so black is zero

46
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:29,830
Brown is one readies to our industry and
song and this is how it is done you get

47
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:39,628
four or five color bands on resistance
and you can break your vehicle sales in

48
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:48,449
brain about this or you can use phone
app to decode it but the simplest way to

49
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:58,370
decoded is to build this role if you use
probe and we can call them abcd burns

50
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:06,379
what's the value of the resistance it's
a big babies two-digit number

51
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:17,400
exponent is C plus minus the percent of
dollars so an example you get a wire to

52
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,169
red gold

53
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:29,400
colors on the resistor with the coded as
4725 what that means is 47 times hundred

54
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:39,489
plus minus minus 5% it makes four point
seven homes resistor you can find for K

55
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:53,870
seven stations some schematics it means
the same as 4.75% resistors use this

56
00:07:53,870 --> 00:08:07,699
rule ABCDE ABCDE his three digit number
times the exponent plus-minus a percent

57
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:17,520
so if we get brown green black orange
right we get 1503 to that means 150

58
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:27,460
times 1000 that means one hundred and
fifty homes plus minus 2% because red is

59
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,718
number two you can find also just 150 K

60
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:40,860
schematics that this is

61
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:50,220
something I prepared for future builders
you don't have to waste your time on

62
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:58,000
indentifying which color is what so
these are all the values we will be

63
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:08,519
using in this project so we get 51 arms
121 K five and you get all the codes and

64
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:19,940
I gave you examples 44 abandoned five
band depends what you gonna skip this so

65
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:27,209
this is just for future use you'll get
this on the side of conference and you

66
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:35,670
can use it tomorrow anytime so you can
speed up your building time these are

67
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:46,040
all the types is we're going to use one
resistor this is the largest 11 maggie

68
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:56,949
is one million more simpler way to find
rich color Richard resistors which is to

69
00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:04,969
use a multimeter in measuring the
resistance I talked about that last year

70
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:14,190
or so you can refer to my last year
presentation when placing resistors find

71
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:25,930
their their appropriate place you can
use 1841 Porter what

72
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:39,880
types these denote the whites the power
it can stand 141 Porter is bigger and it

73
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:47,730
can tightly fit in the place the
prototype uses that one eighth of what

74
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:57,339
will see these are smaller once you have
to band the lead to a resistor 19

75
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:13,180
degrees and to have space of 0.33% in
the designated place esters esters we're

76
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:21,469
gonna use here are ceramics their
brownish in color or blue green round

77
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:30,839
disc shaped their very cheap and you can
find them and everywhere on the picture

78
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:43,410
on the your rights you can see there are
no but

79
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:54,290
we use just too well use 109 affair ads
and 27 because ferrets this can be very

80
00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:01,599
problematic for some of you because
depending on the producer 109 ferrets

81
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:11,680
can be marked as just a hundred and or
104 what's 1040 that's 10,000 pick up

82
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:22,019
for its this ceramics round ceramic
capacitors are usually marked in because

83
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:31,389
ferrets so 10,000 because it's or you
can find American type of marking crazy

84
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:40,839
just 0.1% one that means it's in
microphone its point one micro farad

85
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:47,120
these one hundred and effects it's all
the same and you can also use multi

86
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:55,019
meter to measure the capacitors 2070
coffers is marked justice 27 as I told

87
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:05,620
you that the ceramics are marked in
Pickfords by default so line beneath the

88
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:12,240
number means it's for 50 or 100 wolves
that's not very important for this

89
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,100
project

90
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:20,009
if you don't have one hundred and that
hurts you can try something between ten

91
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:34,410
or twenty to two hundred and twenty-nine
affair it's critical that you can try an

92
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:44,189
experiment this is the filter capacitor
and higher frequencies and get some more

93
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:59,540
electronic sounds 27 Pickfords can be
used 22 here

94
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:10,050
lead spacing leads smaller capacity or
point one distance between Leeds little

95
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:21,180
larger have all points to 109 ferrets on
the PCB are made for all point to but if

96
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:27,849
you get smaller ones you can get it if
you spread their brains a little more

97
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:35,680
twenty send pic of ferrets are very
small and they have just opened one inch

98
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:45,519
with a distance and you can't get larger
ones in there was a point one inch

99
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:53,300
that's the distance between two points
on plastic the ship will be using so you

100
00:14:53,300 --> 00:15:07,839
can make relation to that larger
competitors latex dellums talents are

101
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,380
better quality latex

102
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:17,110
and they have advantage that they are
very small and because we have a very

103
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:22,740
limited space here especially in the
Haight we must use to tell them if you

104
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:28,360
want to make this in this sandwiched
between two plexiglas

105
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:36,980
critics are a little bit higher and
larger so they may be no not maybe they

106
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:44,490
should be fitted in this sandwich but if
you lose this upper layer of plastic you

107
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:58,020
can fit anything but she must be tell
others are not necessarily something

108
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:03,449
very important about capacitors
electrolytic cell type they are

109
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:10,030
polarized so they have plus and minus
electorates and you must place correctly

110
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:18,970
on PCB and oriented although that you
have electrolyte the rights to tell them

111
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:28,500
and you see that tell them is shaped so
it's very specific it's a bright yellow

112
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:36,260
or orange color and they have plus noted
on one side electronic scale minus noted

113
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:47,860
on one site you must look at the PCB and
find mark for plus or minus also if you

114
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:54,090
don't have four point seven Micra
ferrets you can also use my crawford's

115
00:16:54,090 --> 00:17:03,560
and for that matter this prototype uses
micro ferrets and you can sometimes find

116
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:14,280
dellums noted 475 that means 47 times
five exponent in pick up where it's at

117
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,040
4747 microphone its don't be

118
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:32,399
similar to the resistor coding something
we must talk about is treating you can

119
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,370
see that there's scription of both
capacitors 35 that means 225 votes this

120
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,229
is the maximum voltage it can stand
because we have here

121
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:51,000
maximum voltage of 5 faults we can use
anything about that elephants are very

122
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,570
susceptible to damage if you place too
large to join them so you must get

123
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:11,470
appropriate will teach about 10 ok to
large capacitors they want feat sport

124
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:21,840
there's a slight variation on this board
you see on that picture see see see see

125
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:32,260
example you need some plus sign on plus
side of the best sister but it's missing

126
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:40,129
from the PCB but you can't square bad
square paid me is it's where the plus of

127
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:48,940
the capacitor is so on the square pad
you place the plus of the Intel don't

128
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,840
makes it don't turn it around because it
can explode

129
00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:09,340
the transistors we use for transistors
here BC 547 is preferred kind but you

130
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:17,399
can use almost any general purpose and
10 transistor read the correct in out in

131
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:24,090
out means that banks must be in a
specific order if you look at it this

132
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:29,449
transistor you'll see that it has 14
flight sides if you look at the sides

133
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:36,100
from the left to the right you get
collector base and emitter and this is

134
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:43,939
what must your soap substitute
transistor if you want to use some other

135
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,490
kind this is the footprint on the PCB

136
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:57,350
41 want to test resistance before
ordering you can use your multimeter to

137
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:07,439
find their correct type or if they are
working

138
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:16,929
case here is called 292 and any
transistor NPN type with this case can

139
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:27,470
be used such as BC 238 or other types so
it doesn't have to be exactly BC 547

140
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:41,899
they're all working next stop diodes
diodes two pence cathode and anode

141
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:50,268
cathode is denoted with the black bands
on one side of the diet guys we're gonna

142
00:20:50,269 --> 00:21:06,470
use our one and 4148 these are common
signal and be very careful when placing

143
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:14,539
into a PCB you get the band forecasters
on PC bills and also you know to do it

144
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:28,129
square pad so just be careful and take
your time

145
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:35,209
reversed polarity they don't they can't

146
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:50,020
current flow to them you can use one end
1914 instead these are all the same just

147
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:56,649
don't use shot Gears centers and big
black rectifier diodes from a defect in

148
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:03,219
the picture we get black dye dentists
the rectifier that's wrong diet where

149
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,029
are you because they are slow

150
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:19,659
led diodes we get one led died in here
can use almost any shape and color in

151
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:25,029
here are three millimeter but you can
also use five-millimeter if it has

152
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:37,289
correct spacing of point one inch
between Leeds important about LEDs they

153
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:46,799
must be also oriented correctly is
normal dies you noted with square pad

154
00:22:46,799 --> 00:23:01,779
and it won't work so how to identify
them died where the cat varied and put

155
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:10,659
it up against the light and you'll see
one large large large electorate is

156
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:25,970
always sometimes you get shorter main
characters or the most precise

157
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:31,900
way to determine which which which
lecture this case it is by looking at

158
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:48,720
you like towards against the light is
timing device megahertz here we use type

159
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:56,670
because of the height constraints so you
don't use that regular higher one you

160
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:12,390
need this smaller one they can be put
put their not oriented I found one which

161
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:22,490
will feature not documented you can use
trip in their solved as this reprint

162
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:32,920
type it means it has built in to smaller
27 by pic of farad capacitors used this

163
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:43,280
then you don't install 67 and 68 27
because they're already in this package

164
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:50,920
so we did you use capacitors with this
you don't need to that middle pain can

165
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,170
be used for that

166
00:24:52,170 --> 00:25:00,900
p.m. or not refuse to pay an integrated
circuit

167
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:13,120
we was trippin voltage regulator for
regulating water jet 3.3 what's been out

168
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,020
is very important

169
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:22,360
ground ball to general to judge when you
look at the flat side of the body or the

170
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:29,510
integrated circuit for a matter of fact
it looks exactly like transistor so

171
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:36,900
don't makes them because they look at
the same on the board I said to his for

172
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:46,230
this regulator not for the transistor
and mint chip is this

173
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:53,370
take my controller it's very delicate
part and be very careful when ordering

174
00:25:53,370 --> 00:26:04,040
get it has 28 pins goes from 11 down to
pin 14 15 and up to 28 this is the

175
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:12,570
standard way to mark the numbers on the
bottom on the top part of the body of

176
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:21,540
the chip you get a slight indenter cut
out and this means this is the this is

177
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:29,670
the top of the trip where the number one
goes sometimes it has little dot printed

178
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:36,520
with ID number one fan this is important
because you have to put this cheap in

179
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:43,540
right way so you see on this picture
left there's a slight indentation on the

180
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:49,700
one side of the chip and this invitation

181
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:58,289
the right right side of the PCB board
don't turn it around if you are new to

182
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:13,580
this game of soldiering you can try and
use this circuit circuit there it and

183
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:19,918
after soldiering you just put your chip
inside of it so there is no danger of

184
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:29,700
overheating here chip but again it won't
fit in this live out this top layer of

185
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:36,440
plexiglass but if you are just ordering
around for the first time for the first

186
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,789
time that maybe not

187
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:48,840
idea to keep his most expensive part is
built push buttons well these are not

188
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:55,428
the switches because purpose about and
makes contact when pressed and released

189
00:27:55,429 --> 00:28:04,700
there's no contact this field we use
square foot about us or any other kind

190
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:14,360
if you leave out this template of
plexiglass also have been out you can

191
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:21,570
use to pin or 14 models they're called
single portal or single pole double

192
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:31,799
throw their place for both types on the
printed circuit boards just be careful

193
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:37,940
when using four pins find out which
means are connected short when pressed

194
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:49,059
and put those pins on the opposing sides
of this board

195
00:28:49,059 --> 00:29:03,779
connectors very in shape and type first
connector is number 18 is quite so 2.1

196
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:15,960
millimeter for PCB because you also rans
for housing and this is just for PCB on

197
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:24,769
the right is the correct type of
connector in this build positive voltage

198
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:32,009
is on the pain inside of connector and
outer sleeve is negative voltage

199
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:36,929
regulators external power source is
reversed

200
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:45,600
illogical ground is in the middle pienso
tested before using it in this way on

201
00:29:45,600 --> 00:30:03,590
the left to get plug that goes in that
this is USB connector on the right upper

202
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:09,899
picture is the correct type need but
picture is not correct

203
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:17,979
why because it's for surface mounted
devices and this is not the case so we

204
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:25,580
need to hold it has this producing pins
to go to the whole PCB and this is the

205
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:37,629
footprint of that and very important you
can you get power from mini USB you

206
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:46,679
don't connect this controller which USB
USB is used just for bothering

207
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:53,840
and you can probably your device from
the USB or from external voltage don't

208
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:06,970
both of them in the same time just want
is to be 15 for the g8 it's called

209
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:15,640
female from the obvious reasons on the
bottom are wrong types why

210
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:22,530
well first one is male connector second
one is too large defended in this board

211
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:31,080
and on the right side is type of the
connector that is meant to be placed in

212
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:45,350
the house in Co else not for the PCB PCB
this year's in that exact order on the

213
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:52,550
PCB is audio connector

214
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:57,490
standard 34.5%

215
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:11,000
its classic is used almost you need this
type with three pins you can also get

216
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:19,030
this type with my things and it can be
fit in this board and on the right you

217
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:31,389
get some more complicated jack for this
board so we need this time next

218
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:48,428
this is what you get to connect to outer
space audio we need stereo connector on

219
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:56,589
the sleeve is ground tape is left
channel and ring is the right

220
00:32:56,589 --> 00:33:07,729
connectors 55 pinhead there that that
has ninety-degree break on it and you

221
00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:14,570
can't use this white one because it
won't fit it must go from the site and

222
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:26,079
you get also footprint on the PCB is
also it 90 degrees you can't use just

223
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:35,519
one or you can use it but then you have
to lose this top layer of plexiglass I

224
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,509
am I losing so much time on this talk
about connectors this is some of the

225
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:47,739
types of audio connectors coaxial
connectors

226
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:53,489
you can get you see there's various
types and most of them can be fitted in

227
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:58,389
this sport so be very careful when
choosing the right kind also for audio

228
00:33:58,389 --> 00:34:09,350
there is even more so be very careful
and you get your parts

229
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:15,480
you need to to solder it you learn about
that

230
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:24,100
workshop that will make for you tomorrow
when you're finished

231
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,969
amassed tested before using it how we
can test it well you must use multi

232
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:40,159
meter multimeter in this arrange- 424
alt manual ranging first check the

233
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:47,219
external power source as I told you
before on the outer layer of metal

234
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:58,540
miners in plus postage if you were using
USB for power you don't have to check it

235
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,220
is polarized as it should be

236
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:15,589
when connected power LED diet is a let
is working as it should then you have to

237
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:26,180
use a multimeter to test at least 25 alt
and 2.3 walls what is plus or minus 2%

238
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:34,109
while when voltage regulators made it
has also tolerance just like

239
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:46,098
resistor so devoted you are measuring
area plus minus 2 percent from 3.3 volts

240
00:35:46,099 --> 00:36:00,690
its ok also I vote can be customized by
percent where you make while you're

241
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:15,849
black or negative on the ground shield
of the mini USB connector and on the

242
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:23,910
middle pane of the connector you must
measure something around five holes on

243
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:31,069
the pin point eight of the chip you must
measure too important to you

244
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:46,140
its most probably ok you can also you
lost test is to test audio audio

245
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:55,339
must have this voltage around 1.6 1.7
Walt connect to monitoring get the

246
00:36:55,339 --> 00:37:00,950
picture it's fine for their works it's
fine if it's not working

247
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:12,499
check this point here on one point on
one side of this resistor 1.7 was there

248
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:14,618
some problem what's the problem

249
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:20,599
well you must figure it out it's
probably wrong orientation of some part

250
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:26,080
of its older or some cross

251
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:37,279
this is how the bottom of soldered
printed circuit board looks this is

252
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:55,550
correctly made what most usual problem
when soldiering dispense on 28 chip you

253
00:37:55,550 --> 00:38:10,180
can get between two neighboring Plains
also

254
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:20,669
so-called cold joints older when you are
not making very good connections might

255
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:36,420
be heated properly and you must put
enough soldier to make good contact this

256
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:45,210
is what we are measuring here by Walter
three point revolt on 28 and their own

257
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:58,110
connection of our 14 in our nineteen we
get one point seven worlds this you'll

258
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:04,880
see it's not just the Cedar there's also
AC component from the audio that is made

259
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:11,230
by mixing the out

260
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:22,480
yes you can makes this transistors

261
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:32,480
it wrong way around some you must test
meter is ground and collector is high

262
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:43,770
voltage also what can be if you have
good or so you can test this is here if

263
00:39:43,770 --> 00:40:14,630
it has eight megahertz resistors you can
use the same also 51 homes there

264
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:28,320
447 456 well most probably yes but they
all have to be the same and this is very

265
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,580
important

266
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:41,890
36 was beaten tell them and that's about
it you don't want to mess with this too

267
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:50,490
much just check it all the water juice
are ok then you can use it if I told you

268
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:57,529
that you can't use two connectors for
powering the same time will you see plus

269
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:04,900
side of the USB and plus side of the
actual connector all just shorted and if

270
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:12,010
you both of them you can fry something
so just use one power source here

271
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:26,340
and you can refer to this presentation
later and see what type of resistors and

272
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:37,080
capacitors you can use just take your
time and be very patient and to orient

273
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:50,080
oriental this parts correctly diets must
be noted transistors and everything else

274
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:59,850
resistors can be placed anywhere you
like a ceramic capacitor also but for

275
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:14,310
telling us I'd be on the plus side and
this short presentation I hope you find

276
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:28,250
this useful tomorrow and they are in
this project so

277
00:42:28,250 --> 00:43:05,630
but just about that and this regular
away maybe you must put some little the

278
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:12,810
resistor both left and right channel but
maybe on the next generation but you get

279
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:26,009
something on the left on the right blog
I just gave this to a friend of mine to

280
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:42,300
test it and he placed wanna jack output
and ground and we had no idea so you

281
00:43:42,300 --> 00:44:01,890
must use stereo or mono plug but not to
do and butt plug

282
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:21,080
questions I plan to attend the workshop
tomorrow I will try to help and we all

283
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,830
love you too

284
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:34,140
think yourself if you are planning to
build this controller on the some later

285
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,160
date

286
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:48,560
you can mail and ask some questions I'll
try to help you but my advice to you

287
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:57,259
just take time don't rush most people
today tend to rush things in electronics

288
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:05,440
are not very forgiving forgetful with
this stuff so take your time and be very

289
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:21,770
careful about this and you should have
nice Council today so that's one main

290
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:28,320
appeal

291
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:37,360
design presentation
