1
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:25,310
welcome everybody to the next talk first
of all if you have any questions in the

2
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:30,308
question-answer part of the talk please
raise your hand and will give you a

3
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:35,980
microphone and then you can ask a
question so welcome to the talk of

4
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:43,629
building a Cyber Security Operations
Centre for Scott ICS ICS systems from

5
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:54,339
and good evening everyone thank you to
my name is a senior security consultant

6
00:00:54,339 --> 00:01:01,449
working for DTS in Dubai United Arab
Emirates the topic today's by building a

7
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:06,119
Cyber Security Operations Centre for the
SCADA infrastructure and process control

8
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,110
networks are you guys actually work

9
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:17,579
have touched SCADA systems accident
there was some of you guys there's a

10
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:22,350
there's a few slides which will
basically do an introduction so as an

11
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,250
agenda we gonna be talking about SCADA
security the primer and the need to

12
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,780
build a security operation center the
components of building the sock and

13
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,420
ecosystems

14
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,020
importance of actually seemed to 20 la
collection aggregation security

15
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,070
analytics and correlation to keep the
hawkers outside and then we'll go to

16
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,839
specific contextual threat cases and use
cases around understanding house Garda

17
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,520
threads actually penetrate into the
network one of the very important part

18
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,229
in building a security operation center
is to actually understand and building

19
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:01,000
threat intelligence and early warning
detection system right without this is

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,950
not going to be able to effectively
respond and have an incident response

21
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,658
plan and we'll also be talking about
Scottish processes procedures and

22
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:13,909
workflows rate without the process
without a procedure is there is a

23
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:17,720
security breach nobody knows what to do
nobody knows how to escalate the matter

24
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,049
nobody knows how to isolate and contain
the issue and we'll be talking about

25
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:24,100
building an incident offense management
plan

26
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:30,510
and basically talking about cyber stalk
versus the security assurance level now

27
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:36,630
is an overused terminology people
process and technology is paramount to

28
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:42,350
any security assurance within an
enterprise environment itself so scared

29
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,960
I said I was security defense in depth
why cybersecurity important in SCADA

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:54,790
Scott is very different to I T or
enterprise right SCADA is typically

31
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:01,410
controlling a process for example oil
and gas production train railway network

32
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,140
systems etc

33
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,589
discarding infrastructure controls the
process right human safety is involved

34
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,200
and there's a difference when we're
talking about a web server or nit system

35
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,070
going down there's an outage to a web
application whereas when you're talking

36
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,280
about SCADA it is effectively for
example and HMI the controls the

37
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,020
emergency shutdown system so the HMI is
compromised

38
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,960
emergency shutdown system can no longer
be effective which could result in human

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,760
fatality so there are international
standards that govern house Garda

40
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:44,790
security should be carried out you have
the next IC 60443 and the next 26 28 was

41
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,290
Margaret security and of course the most
important thing in chicago is to make

42
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,109
sure the plant is safe from broken and
then intrusion malicious attempts so

43
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,860
typically this is an overall
architecture for SCADA system you have

44
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,690
your traditional enterprise I T
infrastructure which might be secured by

45
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,590
perimeter firewall next-generation IPS
you might be having network access

46
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,390
control email security appliance is but
typically this is the enterprise

47
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,920
environment where employees work at the
corporate office then you have this

48
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,260
garden plant itself and usually
typically there's an air gap

49
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:26,730
an air gap to ensure traffic between the
two networks do not flow but of course

50
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,550
we've all seen stuck next viruses do
claim these are old particular malware

51
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:36,270
targeting a SCADA systems so typically
how do attacks coming to the SCADA

52
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,960
environment to typically you have the
office LAN reaches again when I showed

53
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:48,229
previously here this is the office LAN
now in your plant network you will have

54
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:53,310
a series of machines and depending on
the industry standard that you refer to

55
00:04:53,310 --> 00:05:00,350
this is called level 30 level two and
this is level 1 to level three is where

56
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:05,210
you have the management systems Active
Directory etc then you have level to

57
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,820
which is basically where you have
business process control systems your

58
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,140
OPC servers uhm eyes etcetera views of
controlling critical processes for

59
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,909
example instrumentation devices sensors
PLC czar to use each of these levels

60
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:25,160
should be segmental is owned by it so
how do attacks can come in

61
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,540
misconfigured firewalls infected laptop
from a field engineer walking into the

62
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,260
site and connecting his infected laptop
into the control network itself you have

63
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,930
an authorized connections have been
affected remote support backdoor more

64
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,210
dams on authorize more than USB sticks +
stones which are connected into the lap

65
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,810
dogs respond effectively can penetrate
into the network and then you have third

66
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,260
party issues so there are many different
attack vectors that connected to the

67
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,740
SCADA infrastructure itself and we're
talking about Skardu it's very different

68
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:06,410
to I T right to corporate I T talks
about IBM SAP Oracle ERP solution we're

69
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,300
talking about Windows SharePoint Active
Directory

70
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,810
talking about protocols like HTTP HTTPS
tcp/ip alright but when we're talking

71
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,740
about SCADA it's very different it's no
longer Microsoft we're talking about a

72
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,320
B&B Emerson GE Honeywell Siemens these
are manufacturers of

73
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,880
control system devices and also any
talking about protocols most of the

74
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,510
legacies SCADA systems have migrated
from rs232 into GPIB but they're using

75
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:42,740
specific industrial control particles
and one of these things like Modbus OPC

76
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:51,540
icy particles HMI fieldbus back night
mp3 these are all industrial control

77
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,830
particles and typically what's happened
over the last 10 years is that you have

78
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:02,669
serial connections rs232 which has been
migrated over a tcp/ip stack and all the

79
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:07,860
insecurities that have or chrome rs232
has basically involved in the TCP stack

80
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,950
so if you look at Modbus protocol itself
there's no authentication is no

81
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:16,409
integrity and authenticity right so
anybody can connect using a Modbus

82
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:22,460
communication protocol and change the
function of the sensor itself so why do

83
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,099
we need to build a security operation
center right if you're talking about

84
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:32,580
your traditional I T infrastructure you
have acted dietary Xchange systems you

85
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,180
have SharePoint all of these are
generating different type of logs

86
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,130
there's an onslaught of blogs are coming

87
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,980
firewalls IDS anti-virus anti-malware
etc

88
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,830
millions of logs and I was having a
conversation earlier on about human

89
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:51,909
serum why you need automated tools to be
able to understand that thousands of

90
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:57,050
different logs are coming and to
contextualize them most of the

91
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,990
organizations are inadequately prepared
for a security breach right this is a

92
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,540
fact so when there is a breach nobody
knows what to do if you remember back in

93
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:13,470
2012 there was a sham malware and that
his Saudi Aramco which infected forty

94
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:19,690
thousand machines in Saudi Aramco I was
literally physically there right and

95
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:25,500
what we saw was machines being stretched
off because the master boot copy file

96
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,780
was deleted from the hardest which meant
that none of the machines could actually

97
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,530
boot up

98
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,429
40,000 40,000 desktops

99
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:38,049
were impacted right so it's very
important that every organization should

100
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:41,939
have an instant response plan and a plan
that is coordinated control and

101
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:50,590
effective and the right individuals
identified so what is the

102
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,180
reason why you need to build a sock you
need to provide continuous prevention

103
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,339
protection detection and response
capabilities against threats are

104
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,190
basically ensure that room or
exploitable vulnerabilities identified

105
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:08,380
right and you may also need to talk to
your departure computer emergency

106
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:13,450
response teams as well so what are the
key objectives of building a sock manage

107
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,150
coordinate response the cyberthreat
incidents coordinate with regulatory

108
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:22,329
bodies right so if for example in serbia
you're talking you have a regulation

109
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,100
requirement from the government to be
secure then that is very important that

110
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,960
you collaborate where we do work in
Dubai national government of UAE has

111
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,230
enforce security standards for all the
entities are they have to comply to the

112
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,020
cyber security laws if anybody's
non-compliant then they are basically

113
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:45,100
penalized right and also one very
important what why the reason why you

114
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,560
build a song is that you actually build
a real recovery time objectives so if

115
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,260
the system does go down because of
security breach how long do you have

116
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,130
before you need to recover their system
right this is very important because

117
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:04,630
there's obviously business impact on the
system be down for four hours 44 minutes

118
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:10,460
right so you actually ties in the
business processes around real-time

119
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:17,510
recovery recovery time objectives and
also your service level agreements so

120
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,990
the ability to automate the requirements
to meet compliance of course is very

121
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,880
important in short change control
function is integrated into the sock

122
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,360
right so if firewall administrator is
making a firewall policy change they

123
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,430
should be identified through a change
request procedure right build a

124
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,560
comprehensive reporting dashboard that
is aligned to security metrics and build

125
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,770
a local in-house security incident
response team that collaborates with

126
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,209
national search and of course

127
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:50,368
when you're building a security
operation center for logging monitoring

128
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:54,829
reporting you need to have the processes
that are aligned to this without this

129
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:59,739
effectively will feel when you're
building a security operation center you

130
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,519
don't necessarily have to have physical
teams you can have physical teams with

131
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,160
the virtual teams right so when I'm
talking about Scott there you could have

132
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,639
for example a field engineer that is
having a virtual team respect to a

133
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,569
process control engineer so these are
all responsible from security security

134
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:22,309
is not the responsibility of I T or a
particular function right is the

135
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:26,410
responsibility of the entire
organization so what are the key

136
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:30,559
components of a sock real-time
monitoring to collect the logs from the

137
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:37,469
different devices to correlate the logs
so if a user walks into a side and

138
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:42,480
swipes is RFID card and enters into the
site should be logged in a sense so you

139
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,819
can integrate physical access control
with logical access control and of

140
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:51,399
course would you can do as you can
anomaly rules for example somebody

141
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,259
entered the site after seven o'clock
this should never happen so this can

142
00:11:55,259 --> 00:12:00,209
again be a detection too but there's
physical intrusion reporting is very

143
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:04,998
important right as technical people in
the room we generally forget the

144
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:09,629
oversight rights or to discuss the
management and to build a business case

145
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:14,889
you need to have effective reporting
right of security incidents security

146
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:17,119
incident management is very important
you know

147
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:22,730
pre and post analysis requires
identification is very important as I

148
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,199
mentioned to you before you know people
is there are people of the weakest link

149
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:31,199
and security right from social
engineering aspects technology we all

150
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:34,679
use different technology vendors
firewalls in distributed firewalls

151
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,279
oxidized read read only active dietary
antivirus data leakage prevention

152
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:42,290
systems all the different type of
security products we can think off but

153
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,689
if you don't have a process that ties
everything together and its effect in

154
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:54,439
ineffective when we're talking about
some core components and I'm going to be

155
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:57,610
getting to the more interesting part in
a short while but proactive monitoring

156
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,470
is important

157
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,350
alert notification is even more
important and being able to correlate

158
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,970
the different events is important is
wrong now from a security perspective

159
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,390
how can you be sure that your meeting
the best practice standards this is very

160
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,420
complex and ordered comes in if you
don't implement I mean if you implement

161
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,000
security but you're not following best
practices or is international security

162
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,540
standard then there's no guideline to
what you're doing so following industry

163
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,439
best practice and then becoming
compliant is the best way to move

164
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,600
forward

165
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,370
integrating change management so any
changes done in the infrastructure

166
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,070
correlates to actually change has been
made and then configuration management

167
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:44,570
so is my acted right reconfigured with a
minimum security baseline mir to use on

168
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:49,620
my OPC servers configured without
default passwords is all important

169
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,490
things to do

170
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:56,220
incident response behavior analysis and
reporting is very important when you're

171
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,630
talking about behavior analysis how many
of you guys have a for example on

172
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,120
managing an enterprise infrastructure or
SCADA infrastructure that has multiple

173
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,330
VLANs different type of network
interfaces controlled by a firewall and

174
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:15,500
how many of you are doing active
profiling so for example VLAN 10 is

175
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,490
useful web services now is your
unnatural on web services then you would

176
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:29,210
find web related traffic and I could not
find for example SMB flood so network

177
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,620
profiling is very important this will
help you understand what the network

178
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:39,730
behave like so typically in a building a
thought this is a kind of architecture

179
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,950
talking about so you have your permit to
network with its MPLS VPLS or private

180
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,610
links but this is the corporate I T
infrastructure which then connects to

181
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:54,410
your labor for DMC of the SCADA which
would typically be segmented to a

182
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,180
firewall where you have web services
running for example and device of their

183
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,770
servers and the pie service then you
have your layer three networks which are

184
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,880
basically SCADA management bus

185
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,560
which is a gym I doctored 03 and
Microsoft servers with DCS applications

186
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,609
running on their legs etc and then you
go your level to level 1 devices which

187
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,240
are OPC servers connected to your
instrumentation devices sensors the

188
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,840
Aussies are to use above that is your
data acquisition which is basically

189
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,920
collecting the logs from the different
devices and being collecting all your

190
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,449
login analyzed data warehouse about the
data layer you have the data

191
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:40,790
collaboration security vulnerabilities
and event correlation itself so

192
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,689
typically you have all the different
levels which are sending all your logs

193
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:55,370
to a Sim 2 202 how many of you guys have
heard of seemed alright

194
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:04,410
so same is security information and
event management right it's a tool that

195
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,250
is used to collect all the different
logs from the different systems right so

196
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:15,210
to ensure stability traceability for
example if you making a modification on

197
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,810
Microsoft Exchange Active Directory

198
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,209
to be compliant you need to be able to
collect logs right so this is a tool

199
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,820
that collects the logs from the
different devices but not just for

200
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,690
example Microsoft infrastructure is
collecting logs from firewalls IPS Lord

201
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:35,190
balances etc so when building a thought
you need to of course monitor your

202
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,880
infrastructure if you don't want to
infrastructure you can be proactive in

203
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,900
doing operations right so this is the
tool that does a lot collection

204
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:49,470
correlation analytics and then you have
the component of compliance and

205
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,660
management of policy compliance does my
Windows Server meet my minimum security

206
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,439
baseline on my GPO is restricted on my
registry keys restricted does it still

207
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,630
have the full accounts etc right and
then what you can do is you can

208
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,130
integrate vulnerability management
network monitoring as an MPP and service

209
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,310
their ticketing sir

210
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:18,200
when building a sock Security Operations
Centre you need to have a sim solution

211
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,770
this is the first and foremost typically
what is it syslog log files application

212
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:27,260
like export and then network behavior
analysis using NetFlow so all your

213
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:32,160
switches or routers firewalls are
sending either J floor net floor as flow

214
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,800
to the same solution so that you can
start building network traffic

215
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,290
identification once I have all the logs
and the floor so I can then correlate I

216
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:46,250
can try to understand for example
somebody plugged into a USB into the

217
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:51,640
machine and then there was a propagation
of SMB traffic to all the different

218
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,360
machines in the same broadcast network
and compliance and management and policy

219
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,320
conformance rights as I mentioned to you
before you need to have to follow

220
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,590
industry best practice to be compliant
so what are these ISO 27001 and ISO

221
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:13,350
60443 how many of you guys ever devised
our 27001

222
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:24,699
so these are international standards
that should be used as a benchmark to be

223
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,680
compliant and to give the organization
security assurance that there are at

224
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,630
least meeting the minimum security
baseline network security perform

225
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,720
security monitoring as an appealing
utilization is also very important right

226
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,540
so if an interface goes down it could
impact particular security from a

227
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,250
business perspective and security
intelligence like network forensics

228
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,530
situation awareness artifacts capturing
package to be able to reconstruct the

229
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:58,210
packet successful so typically what we
found right and this is our experience

230
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:02,630
working in the UAE right so
organizations are quite well mature the

231
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,910
situation within serbia was certainly
organizations are doing the logging

232
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:12,360
right the basic logging collecting the
logs so there's a breach then or why the

233
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,729
breach happened but the contourlet the
different beaches right then or if

234
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,510
somebody or administrator logged in and
logged out the basic logging is there

235
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:26,360
and then you have your traditional
ability management software to do scans

236
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,080
of the Metro identifying missing patches
wonder abilities etc and then you have

237
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,629
the network TV was basically monitoring
the network right

238
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,580
SNMP monitoring link utilization sleep
utilization etc

239
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:45,419
each of the team within an enterprise is
working as a sign of independently is no

240
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,910
collaboration or integration no
communication so when I'm talking about

241
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,460
next-generation Sauk centre's most not
centers we're talking about an

242
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,370
integrated local so for example you have
your different devices microsoft

243
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:07,020
announces firewalls switching routers
IPS system controls or sending your logs

244
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,660
to seem to 20 devices and then for
policy compliance and configuration

245
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,420
management that is being monitored by
klan compliance and monitoring now if

246
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,340
there is a particular incident on any
one of these devices the same solution

247
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,990
will be able to identify based on the
use cases that you've defined and can

248
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:29,060
generate the ticket your service desk
and your service and based on the

249
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,860
process that you have defined you'll be
able to isolate the case because you

250
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,709
know exactly which person to call how to
remediate the particular problem and

251
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,600
then of course we have the ability
management where it's going the

252
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,959
infrastructure and sending wonderful it
is Candida back to the same 20 so for

253
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,620
example if you have a Microsoft or a
UNIX system that has not been patched

254
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:55,830
the vulnerability scanner is caning this
system dependability management and

255
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,860
there's an attack this actually targeted
towards the system itself the same will

256
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,429
be able to correlate the data from the
vulnerability management and the attack

257
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:08,150
has been rejected by the IPS hantavirus
and correlate these two locks together

258
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:12,490
to be able to say there's been a
particular attack itself so we're

259
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,250
talking about SCADA systems right as I
mentioned before this is the corporate I

260
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,030
T discarded infrastructure you might
have a DMZ

261
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,780
how the plan side you might have remote
sites but what you need to do is you

262
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,570
need to think from us from

263
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:31,169
defense in depth perspective right so
having firewall at the corporate level

264
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:36,180
having a firewall UTM device or
industrial grade firewall at the latest

265
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,930
three-level a two-level implementing
endpoint security not only from an

266
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:45,340
antivirus perspective but data leakage
prospective host Intrusion Prevention is

267
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,240
also very important because you can
identify the traffic profile those

268
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,070
hitting a particular server a virtual
machine and based on that profile all of

269
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,500
these logs that are being generated by
these different systems are being sent

270
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:04,510
to a centralized sim solution which is
doing the correlation analytics and

271
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,350
based on the logs that are received

272
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:15,449
you can then create incidents that don't
match to normal usage so it's very

273
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,880
important to build security operations
center processes so things like data

274
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,470
security monitoring asset classification
normalization data dressed event

275
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:31,240
management right so to be able to do
comprehensive operations or security

276
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,560
operations you need to know the
different type of logs out for example

277
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:40,010
simply generated by Windows machines you
have security logs you have system logs

278
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,490
you have event logs each of these
different Apple auction-rate different

279
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,840
type of event IDs so it's very important
that whenever you for example

280
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,800
configuring a Cisco switch or Cisco
router to send logs exactly the type of

281
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,690
logs that should be sent to the
centralized logging solution that

282
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,590
incident response practiced as I
mentioned before if there is a security

283
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:04,379
incident you need to understand how to
monitor your infrastructure we need to

284
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,380
understand how to escalate the incident
and who to do reporting to and how to

285
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:14,240
carry out the root cause analysis when
you have a security operation center and

286
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,180
we've seen it for large enterprises that
they need to have like personnel this

287
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,670
working 24 by seven to cover the entire
shift and typically this is very

288
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:26,180
important so that when there is a
particular breach you hand over from one

289
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:31,950
escalation engineer to another to
another etcetera later recovery

290
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,720
procedures this is also very important
and should be part of a subprocess right

291
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,820
is a virtual machine

292
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,309
an was to be breached was to be
compromised

293
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:44,990
how can you quickly recover from that
particular situation right so I said to

294
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:49,250
you before defining the recovery time
objectives and recovery point objectives

295
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,009
are very important because without this
you will ever know from a business

296
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:58,200
impact perspective how quickly we need
to be able to go back bring your backup

297
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,980
line and bring the washing machine back
online each different type of security

298
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:10,000
incident should have a different process
right so for example antivirus virus

299
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,019
outbreak is different to for example a
DNS cache poisoning or internet misuse

300
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:20,450
or suspicious activity monitoring each
one has a different process because each

301
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:26,350
one has a different escalation procedure
went ability management how often do you

302
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,668
scan the DMZ in the Haight
infrastructure you can scan on a regular

303
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:33,919
basis right but in the Scarlet systems
you cannot just can

304
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:40,789
intrusive way even in a non-intrusive
way so it has to be controlled in NASCAR

305
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:44,490
environment you also have no internet
connectivity so it's impossible to carry

306
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:48,679
out for example virus ignition patching
etc so you need to do it in a controlled

307
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:54,200
manner and of course as as a security
operation center you should be building

308
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,970
operating manuals for all the different
components that you have within within

309
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,690
your infrastructure itself

310
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,230
police security alarms and alone
classification is very important right

311
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,840
so whenever there's a critical along
what is the actions that define how to

312
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,120
fix those issues and of course you know
investing in a security operation center

313
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,189
where you're monitoring all the defense
capabilities you need to be able to

314
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,889
report back to the management to say
these are the different type of attacks

315
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:23,779
that we prevented and these with a
different baby I C is a virus outbreak

316
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:27,509
your reporting to save you contain the
virus outbreak within a matter of hours

317
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:31,160
not days so

318
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,630
when you're building your security
operations center you need to be able to

319
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:41,380
monitor your infrastructure but you can
only monitor what you know so first of

320
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,570
all you need to start creating a
topology argue infrastructure the

321
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:51,510
location device type systems security
zones where Blair application-layer DMZ

322
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:57,250
layer of business process control
systems lear I dealer demarcation points

323
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:02,250
ingress points so you might be having
different songs in your SCADA systems

324
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:06,000
and usually these different zones are
talking to a high-security Leo to a

325
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,220
low-security later and this is what we
call a point you writes our

326
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,910
communication between a low security
layer to a high-security should at least

327
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:19,720
be controlled so typically this is what
our control systems network looks like

328
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,310
right you have for example

329
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:27,679
skaardal and write one single broadcast
domain and I did you ask our servers

330
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,270
communication networks application
servers probably a firewall that

331
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:35,510
basically makes the communication to the
office now and then you have MPLS

332
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:44,470
network that connects to a substation
lands etc right so you can identify

333
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:50,740
something unusual here what's the
problem from a security architecture

334
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:59,230
perspective basically what you find here
is that all of these systems are

335
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:06,910
connected to a single vena a single
Metro is no segmentation based on the

336
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:11,510
notion that you're following is that
each of these systems are having the

337
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:17,010
same security zone same security trust
level which are typically not happen and

338
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,020
this is what we find in SCADA systems
legs because its legacy infrastructure

339
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:26,060
the system the PRC Zarate use can only
talk at the later to level the routing

340
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,350
so it's very important

341
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:32,240
when you're building a security
operation center to understand the

342
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,000
architecture of what your infrastructure
looks like where this idea or SCADA

343
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,830
infrastructure right to start building
your different zones so is on one being

344
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:49,559
the corporate network 15 and then
basically sums on four three two and one

345
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:55,799
and typically when you're building a
song you need to make sure that your

346
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:00,910
logs from the different devices are
being sent to a centralized solution

347
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:05,909
that can identify incidents and attacks
without this you're just waiting for the

348
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:09,690
attack to happen and you're not really
understanding how to do the root cause

349
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:14,880
or identify with the attack is so having
a defense in depth rosie is very

350
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,230
important right so as with everything we
start with physical security this is

351
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:25,990
very important in SCADA right then the
network infrastructure belatedly a

352
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:33,169
three-layer four-level switching routing
basic fire one that I T DMZ emission

353
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:39,409
control systems so operating system to
hardening the operating system and then

354
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:46,070
hardening the application itself all the
way up to hardening the POC Eunice so

355
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,700
typically when you're securing an hour
when you sport securing an architecture

356
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,220
or enterprise environment we need to
understand the communication flows right

357
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:00,510
now we're talking about penetration
testers and testers or at Packers or

358
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:06,270
ethical hackers they'll try to penetrate
into a web application right to prevent

359
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,770
this from happening

360
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,929
one of the things that we would do is to
break down the floor so in this

361
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:15,860
particular case this is an MPLS network
and you have connectivity going through

362
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:22,600
your firewalls and then to reach this
particular survey here sir

363
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:32,549
right now in this particular case you
can see the red aril that connects to

364
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:37,070
the load balancer which hit a virtual IP
then hits the server itself so are the

365
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,129
most important things when you're
building a security operation center is

366
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,770
to actually build security service
catalog and what they mean by this is

367
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,860
understand the flaws and applications in
your infrastructure and designed the

368
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,570
security around the flaws and
communication mechanisms so in this

369
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:57,740
particular case I know this is a service
that is being used by users and what I

370
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:02,100
will protect this service because this
is a communication path I will try to

371
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:07,030
harden my router's firewall policies the
application delivery controller balancer

372
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:12,370
as well as the application itself and
the operating system so if you had a

373
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:18,489
long this process you know you can
always be sure that you eliminate 1995

374
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:24,159
to 99% of the attacks because a lot of
these attacks or script kiddie like the

375
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:31,280
targeted attacks on the sophisticated
tax so when you believe

376
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,320
operations center is very important to
understand assets where the Asus in the

377
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,610
network so the name the description but
taking owner or the custodian of the

378
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:46,260
system and the business on this is very
important so one of the things that you

379
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:51,090
can do in identifying assets across your
infrastructure is to scan your

380
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:56,408
infrastructure do a device discovery
fingerprinting and then start reverse

381
00:30:56,409 --> 00:31:03,919
engineering at other important things
are to build thread cases right so for

382
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:09,990
example if you have a domain controller
in your car system which is controlling

383
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,740
your Active Directory domain and all the

384
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,530
Windows service that you have a part of
the demesne could secure your domain

385
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:21,160
controller is one of the most important
things you can do what you must do any

386
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,190
modification to keep you always can
impact all the different domain member

387
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:30,050
service so whenever an administrator
logs onto the Active Directory and makes

388
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:34,649
the GPO modification you can use this as
a threat case or a use case that suit

389
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:39,570
should be monitored by a sim solution to
any modification is immediately reported

390
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:44,080
by these are some of the use cases that
you should you can easily carry out but

391
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,629
crying out for example file gap
announces right these are important task

392
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,600
to do from hardening perspective and
menu building threat cases you can

393
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,059
contextualize it based on our service
and the user century so when you're

394
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:00,730
building trade cases you can based
around operating system the application

395
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:05,340
itself the UNIX systems privileged
access monitoring I mean how often do we

396
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:11,740
find that networks and applications have
breached because I T administrator

397
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:17,660
himself is vulnerable right so if I want
to attack a particular organization the

398
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,670
first thing I would do is go on LinkedIn
identified the idea administrator that

399
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:25,750
works with that organization right
center phishing email and try to

400
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,820
penetrate into the idea administrator
because he has privileges to all the

401
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:35,129
systems and we've seen that so it's
important not only to monitor you know

402
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:41,330
nonideal users but also I T users so
when you're building a security

403
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:46,320
operation center you must understand the
threat and you must understand how the

404
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,629
infrastructure is used from a service
point of view communication protocol

405
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:55,410
perspective and then build a threat
cases around this so in this particular

406
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,240
case one threat

407
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,370
one particular threat cases with a
unique ideas redevelop so multiple log

408
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:07,209
on from a single user from different
locations this is an example is a very

409
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:14,690
high level example but is an example
where a single user has logged in from

410
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:20,950
Dubai and from Serbia Novi Sad you
cannot be into location at the same time

411
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:25,630
so these are the kind of threat cases
there are developed and built into the

412
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:30,800
same solution right and understand the
authentication architecture for example

413
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:37,770
is how you build so in this particular
case I have an A X Server IBM I have two

414
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:44,580
uses a and user be they're both trying
to ssh authenticate to the X server so

415
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,610
once the authenticate you'll be able to
differentiate using air and used to be

416
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:53,979
but the moment the Escalade the
privilege to root level sudo su miners

417
00:33:53,980 --> 00:34:02,030
route then they both become root root
users so from a similar-looking

418
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:07,590
perspective I lose traceability right so
understanding the authentication

419
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,600
mechanism is very important because then
you can start introducing additional

420
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:16,219
controls like a third party software
that would basically run session

421
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:19,928
recording and session recording is then
integrated into seem so you always

422
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:26,580
maintained traceability this is an
example of a scar dashboard tried so

423
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:31,409
that was developed so here for example
you can see some nice graphs

424
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:38,129
communication with the NASCAR the
environment and here you'll find we've

425
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:47,399
integrated a Modbus PLC into a sim
solution so how many of you guys know

426
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:52,388
what was political the usual hands

427
00:34:52,389 --> 00:35:00,349
alright so just like in the Internet
world GDP in this car will be used more

428
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:09,500
both ok Modbus is a legacy protocol
that's insecure and it's basically so

429
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,269
imagine if this is the machine this is a
human machine interface and imagined as

430
00:35:14,269 --> 00:35:19,450
a sensor and the sensor is moving up and
down because its controlling the flow of

431
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:25,259
oil gas through the pipeline and this is
a sensitive is monitoring the cubic

432
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:30,579
meters of gas that is being supplied now
this machine is doing to remote

433
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:36,390
telemetry to the sensor over tcp/ip and
controlling the movement of the sensor

434
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:42,940
right now this communication protocol to
be pleased Modbus in Montrose this

435
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:48,260
machine can read the registry values
which means tell me that the sensor is

436
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:53,549
at this level or its at this level the
machine can also write to the register

437
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:58,940
means modify ok so

438
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:04,089
in a security operations center if I
modify the particular movement of a

439
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:11,270
sensor this means impacting revenue
impacting production etc right down nor

440
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:16,200
floor so it's very important that you
understand this communication protocols

441
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,450
and build this into operation center and
in this example you can see for example

442
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:26,439
a new connection has been established on
Modbus which means another machine is

443
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:32,050
trying to connect and tried to modify
registry values also one of the things I

444
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:36,500
mentioned before his profile your
network right in NASCAR environment you

445
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,980
will never see public IP addresses in
Ascot environment you should never see

446
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,609
public IP addresses because it's never
connected to the Internet in this

447
00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:52,200
example field engineer has connected his
machine to the network and because he's

448
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,549
got you know he's got all sorts of
things configured on his laptop it's

449
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:03,290
immediately making a call to a server in
the us- the same solution picks it up

450
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,670
because the firewall is reporting it all
through NetFlow and immediately you

451
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:10,030
identify this is suspicious activity

452
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:14,650
one of the things that you can do in
your organization right when you're

453
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:19,390
building a sock did you can have a fence
management so for example you have in

454
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:23,339
your organization just like you have a
system devices and hostnames you can

455
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:25,720
have incident host names as well

456
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,970
building workflows Security
Investigations is very important

457
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:35,049
writes all the different logs are coming
into the to be one of the first things

458
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:41,010
you identify as if it's a false-positive
or false-negative once you identify

459
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:46,510
suppose positive then who do you use the
system Warner containing the issue

460
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:51,660
reporting the issue making sure it
doesn't happen again

461
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:56,839
other things that are interesting to do
is building your own internet page right

462
00:37:56,839 --> 00:38:00,328
and this is quite handy because if
you're managing a large enterprise

463
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:05,180
environment you can build your own
internet page and build thread cases so

464
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,450
in this particular case I don't know if
you know RSA Authentication Manager

465
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:18,348
anybody knows or so but this is a
two-factor authentication key fob right

466
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:23,880
is a one-time password now imagine I'm
an employee of an organization and I

467
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:30,010
have the key fob and I terminated so
that I T minister at a house disabled

468
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:36,829
that particular key fob but at from home
is still trying so in the case of this

469
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:41,059
example an authorized user trying to
authenticate with expired or disabled

470
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:49,299
talking in your sock center you will get
this appearing triple-a RSA 003

471
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:56,270
immediately you take this put it into
your portal and you know the reason why

472
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,869
this happened how to investigate who to
call

473
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:03,150
what is the issue so you know you have a
coordinated plan when it comes to

474
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:09,910
incident response and and finally
building security assurance level is

475
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,129
very important so those who work in
scarred infrastructure you have

476
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:17,920
basically 7 functional requirements
access control so users connecting to

477
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,329
the network users authenticating use
control data integrity confidentiality

478
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:28,339
restricting data flows using firewalls
time he responds to an event which is

479
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:33,640
basically a security operation center
and resource availability

480
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,650
I'm not gonna talk too much about this
because you know there's only a few guys

481
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,279
that are in the car itself the basis of
the most important thing is that

482
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:46,069
whenever you're trying to secure an
infrastructure we need to understand

483
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:48,950
where you are right

484
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,500
build the control surrounded and built
operations around it because there's no

485
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,220
point having an infrastructure so if
you're working for a bank or government

486
00:39:55,220 --> 00:40:00,038
entity you need to secure the enterprise
environment right there's no point

487
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:03,960
building all the security and you're not
monitoring logging it doing or

488
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,390
disability and be able to do
investigation if there is a breach

489
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:13,609
alright so logging monitoring doing
security operation is just as important

490
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:19,950
if not as important as building a secure
infrastructure thank you very much for

491
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:26,089
your time

492
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:48,650
questions raised so I actually did in
previous company and one of the problems

493
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:53,860
that I can see with your design is you
haven't looked at the people because

494
00:40:53,860 --> 00:41:00,460
this is an entry level position and so
you have a lot of turnover in a sock so

495
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,180
you if if you are very skilled you're
probably going to move up to a higher

496
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,740
position so you how like you know what
sort of remedy do you have to keep

497
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:13,939
people in a sock and you know my
ultimate thing of the question is there

498
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:19,970
should be a career in show I mean
typically risen to I agree with you but

499
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:25,890
you have to remember that definitely
there's a high generate right in and

500
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:31,299
stop centers and you do start off at
entry level but typically what we found

501
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,560
is that you have level one sock
engineers or analyst level to level

502
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:41,299
three and that's how the organization
again I'm talking about you know large

503
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:46,080
organizations that have a huge
infrastructure to manage they have 24 by

504
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:51,170
7 defense capability monitoring this is
more of an organizational issue but

505
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:55,950
certainly from a people's perspective
they need to understand this what is a

506
00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:01,029
song at the end as I mentioned I don't
think is the responsibility of security

507
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:04,820
or I T right it's it's the
responsibility of the entire

508
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,410
organization and this does that's how I
see it and we've seen successful

509
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:13,990
implementation of socks because you need
hecho process you need to finance

510
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:18,560
process to be integrated into stock if
somebody leaves it's a job and I T shoot

511
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,460
right which means you have to work
together

512
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:27,880
all right thank you very much for your
time
