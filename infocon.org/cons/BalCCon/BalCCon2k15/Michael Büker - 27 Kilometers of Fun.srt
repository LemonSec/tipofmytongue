1
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:27,050
the next thirties Tennessee element of
surprise about technology hardware of

2
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,680
particle accelerator so serious

3
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:43,550
all right thank you will be hard but i
wanna be your beauty of this summer

4
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:58,069
so I work at physical research center
and the center is called dizzy and the

5
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,870
place where I work is in the city of
homework it's the second biggest city in

6
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:11,130
Germany and there we have quite a number
of particle accelerators and I work in

7
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,660
science communication that means I look
at what the researchers doing and I

8
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,470
tried to explain it to the general
public like you people and I tried to

9
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:29,840
make people better understand about
physics and what is happening so let me

10
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,820
start with an invitation because if you
have a chance to come to the north of

11
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,410
Germany then it's a good opportunity to
visit homework and you will be able to

12
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:44,390
see all of these things that I put her
on the pictures we have some particle

13
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,880
accelerators there and one that is
especially cool to see is the one on the

14
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,988
upper right this is called the HERA
accelerator it is not in use today but

15
00:01:55,989 --> 00:02:01,399
this means it is an opportunity for you
to go and see it up close it has a

16
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:07,280
circumference of over six kilometers and
it is the largest accelerator in the

17
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,810
world that is now easily accessible to
visitors so if you have a chance to come

18
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,629
to work then it will be a good
opportunity to visit easy today I will

19
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:21,989
be talking about particle accelerators
in general and some of the physics that

20
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:27,879
we do but mostly about the Large Hadron
Collider which is the accelerator in

21
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:35,200
Switzerland and it's the one with the 27
kilometers of fun and much of the

22
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,390
technology that I will be describing has
also been developed a daisy because it

23
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,760
once not today but sometime ago it was
one of the leading one of the most

24
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,290
important particle accelerator centers
in the world

25
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,730
ok so I will talk about what we are
doing

26
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:58,230
and why we try to do this to find out
things about physics naturally and I

27
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,399
will be describing some of the devices
and the hardware that we use and there

28
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,260
is also an I T aspect to it because as
we will see there is an enormous amount

29
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:13,679
of data that is generated and the state
has to be collected and processed

30
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,519
what we are doing is we are using
accelerators in the shape of a ring we

31
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,379
call them storage ring and also impart
some linear accelerators that make the

32
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:30,040
particles gorgeous in a straight line
and we give high energy to the particles

33
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,780
which is the same as to say that we make
them fast but to say that we make them

34
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,280
fast is only half the truth because at
some point when you get close to the

35
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,609
speed of light then you cannot make the
particle much faster because the speed

36
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:48,739
of light is the limit but we can still
increase the energy we can double the

37
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:53,090
energy triple the energy but still the
speed will stay very close below the

38
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,650
speed of light so when we get to high
energies it makes more sense to speak of

39
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,109
just the energy and not the actual speed
and well when we have gotten them to a

40
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:07,660
very large speed we make them collide
and then we see what happens and

41
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,560
actually this see what happens is
something that is very difficult and

42
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,250
requires quite a bit of detector
technology and I will be talking also

43
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:22,349
about that so the the basis of this kind
of research that we are doing is this

44
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:29,120
famous formula which says that energy is
actually the same as mass but let me try

45
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,900
to put it may be in terms that are a bit
closer to someone if you are tinkering

46
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,479
with electronics what if I say that
parts electric parts electronic parts

47
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,050
are actually like the same as a device
that you can build from them and we

48
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,560
might make it look like this so the
parts is really the same as the device

49
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,039
ok kind of you know but not a hundred
percent you have to put the parts

50
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,909
together in the right way otherwise the
device will not work and if you have the

51
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,610
device it's not the same as the parts
because the parts are put together you

52
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,700
connect them

53
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,969
and it's not the same as all the
individual parts so you know the analogy

54
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:12,760
works a little bit so if the mass can
constitute something that we want to

55
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,530
find out about like for example of the
Higgs particle then how about we just

56
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,859
take the energy and put it together in
the right way and we have exported ko

57
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,880
finished well actually it's not so easy
because we cannot assemble we cannot

58
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,550
just take energy and make the right
thing out of it there is no construction

59
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,520
manual for the Higgs boson so what we
actually have to do is we have to create

60
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,770
the energy in a very messy in a very
unprecedented process which is the

61
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,130
collisions of particles and it doesn't
look like this

62
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,150
putting parts together nicely into a
device is rather looks like this we make

63
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,570
the collisions and the result is lots of
collision products and out of all these

64
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,940
collision products we wonder maybe there
is in sight the divisive advice or the

65
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,390
Higgs particle that we are looking for
but it's a very hard job to find out

66
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,580
from all these things that come out of a
collision

67
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,979
if there really is the right thing in
there and that's what you need detector

68
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:17,410
for so we need the accelerator to make
the particles fast we need the

69
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,360
coalition's to convert the energy into
something and then we need the detector

70
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,850
to find out if something has the thing
that we are looking for

71
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:33,310
so these are the three things that we
are using and now I would like to tell

72
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,690
you about the first part of this about
the accelerator and how it looks so

73
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,620
storage ring the first surprised it's
not actually a ring so it's not a

74
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,090
perfect circle it always has some
straight parts and the straight parts

75
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:53,780
are used to are the place where the
particles actually get their energy now

76
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,270
let's think about how we can give energy
to a particle we do it by using electric

77
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,520
fields but again maybe we can find an
idea that's a bit closer to our hearts

78
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,909
imagine some kind of racing video game
and you have these these booster arrows

79
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,050
on the ground right through

80
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,750
you drive onto them and you get faster
we can do this with charged particles

81
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:22,509
imagine an electron or a proton is like
the little racing car in this game and

82
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,509
an electric field if the polarity is
correct

83
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:30,830
can be like a booster so ok what do we
do to make the particle really fast well

84
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,669
we just put a lot of boosters and and it
will make the particle go really fast

85
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:41,609
well this would mean that we need a
large electric field how large well

86
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,940
really large the energies that we want
to give to the particles like for

87
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,889
example an electron it would need an
electric field off billions of faults so

88
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,360
governments and this is something that
technically is not really possible to do

89
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,389
because you know how what generator do
you need for a gig of alts what

90
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:07,509
connections do you need what cables do I
need for a gig of its not practically

91
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:13,889
possible so this is kind of a forbidden
way but what if we could do electric

92
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:16,979
fields that are opposite to each other
and put them in a row

93
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:22,310
well it would look like this ok so
here's our our particle and it gets a

94
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:28,110
boost but then the next field it slows
it down so boost slowdown boost slowdown

95
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,800
nothing happens but here's the trick we
can use alternating current just

96
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:38,419
alternating like you have from your
power socket and if we alternated with

97
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,649
the right frequency then we can make it
look to the particle like it's always on

98
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,390
an accelerating path so the protocol is
coming and it sees the first

99
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:53,500
accelerating filled the next one will
slow down but when it gets to this point

100
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:59,270
we switch all the fields polarity
changes and so the next thing that the

101
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,990
particle seizes also in accelerating way
and this way from the point of view of

102
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,880
the particle it's always just
accelerating and what we do is actually

103
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,850
with which the fields now this
alternating current thing is is not

104
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,010
magic you know

105
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,010
like I said the power socket has an
alternating current of fifty hurts so

106
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,680
the polarity changes fifty times a
second so we can think about what kind

107
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,020
of what kind of frequency do we need to
accelerate the electrons

108
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,020
what we put in is that we have a device
which is about one and a half metres

109
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:38,460
long it's called the cavity that is
where the magic happens so if the cavity

110
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,960
is about one and a half metres long how
fast as the electron going well we know

111
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,180
that because electrons have a very very
slow small mass and to make them go the

112
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,810
speed of light they just need a slightly
so we give some energy to the electrons

113
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,300
and their speed will be almost the speed
of light and we can calculate with that

114
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,849
ok so it's one of the house meters
divided by the speed of light and the

115
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,490
result is a few nanoseconds so every few
nanoseconds we must switch the field

116
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:15,220
because that's when the particle exits
from 170 to another and so a field that

117
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,630
changes every few nanoseconds has a
frequency of gigahertz and as we know

118
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,150
electrical fields on the order of
gigahertz also they're not magic they

119
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,470
are like microwaves they're like
wireless just that we need a little bit

120
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,500
bigger of a device to generate the kind
of feels that we are looking for this is

121
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,000
the capital like I said about
one-and-a-half metres long and it is the

122
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,050
device that we used to put inside this
alternating electric field with the

123
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,130
frequency of the gigahertz and the
electrons are rushing through it now if

124
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:51,110
we have a circle accelerator then it's
ok if we have just maybe not one but if

125
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,790
we had just have a handful of these
devices because the particles will come

126
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:59,819
by lots of times right we put our
acceleration here the particles going to

127
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,670
circle and so they get an energy kick
and an energy kick an energy kick and

128
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,099
after a while they will have been
accelerated and we don't need many

129
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:14,140
hundreds of those just a few because
they come by all the time and so this

130
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,730
this thing is about one and a half
metres long is made up mostly of a metal

131
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,530
that is called niobium

132
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:25,390
I had never heard of this before that so
niobium is the only thing I know

133
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:30,360
the only thing I know where they used
for these cavities and some things in

134
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,840
accelerators the metal that we use needs
to satisfy three conditions you need to

135
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,800
make it you need to be able to put it
into a shape because as you can see the

136
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,849
shape is very special it looks like
donuts or something and it needs to be

137
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:50,510
the shapes of the electric field will
fit in just right and it cannot be too

138
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,569
expensive because we need a lot of it
and you need to be able to cool it down

139
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:00,490
for a superconducting temperature now
superconducting means that some metal if

140
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,720
you some metals if you're cool them down
to a very low temperature will lose

141
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,100
their electrical resistance so they will
not be electrical energy converted into

142
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,010
heat and this is good because with our
large electric fields that change over

143
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,910
time there are large currents flowing
and we don't want to heat up this thing

144
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:23,260
because it might melt or something so we
just cool everything done and it has

145
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,020
cooled to a temperature of for Calvin's
that is minus two hundred and sixty nine

146
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:35,910
degrees Celsius it's very cold we use
liquid helium to do this and yes that's

147
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,030
how we do that now the microwave

148
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,760
hurts changing electric field it needs
to come from somewhere we cannot just

149
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:48,850
connect household microwave because it's
not powerful enough what we use is a

150
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:54,100
device that is called a clue strong and
a Christian can they build them had two

151
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,930
different frequencies the lower end is
about hundreds of megahertz and it goes

152
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:04,339
up to two sometimes even more than 2
gigahertz of frequencies and we can see

153
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,430
here that the power which they generated
around 300 kilowatts that is just the

154
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:15,699
power for the electric field which is
used to to drive the particles and we

155
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,870
don't just used one of those we need
sixteen times 300 kilowatts for the

156
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,420
fields that drive the the particles as
the comparison because this is you know

157
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,839
something like a radio transmitter we
heard yesterday that to have a normal

158
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:36,100
ham radio conversation from here to
Japan you need about 20 Watts I looked

159
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:42,410
up the power that nasa uses two talk two
spacecraft out by Pluto they use about

160
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:48,560
20 kilowatts and here we have 300
kilowatts to accelerate a few particles

161
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,849
so it's it's actually a large energy use
and at these higher energies and that

162
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,990
these high frequencies it's actually
better not to use cables you can makes

163
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,990
these kinds of signals go through a
cable but then you shouldn't let the

164
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,420
cable lying around in a loop or maybe
the connectors filmmaker problem so what

165
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,079
better way to transport these radio
waves of these microwaves is actually

166
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:22,080
waveguides and you can see it up here it
looks like it's for air but it's

167
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,920
actually not for transporting harrods
hollow metal to you and it's like a

168
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:32,380
reflector so I have this metals you and
had one and I stick in an antenna and

169
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:37,140
the antenna transmits and because there
are other metal walls of the thing the

170
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,990
radiation gets reflected around and it
can only move in one direction which is

171
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:48,450
the direction of the waveguide so to
transport the energy the fields from the

172
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,140
klystron where it is generated to the
actual accelerate we use these

173
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:59,300
waveguides and inside the fields
propagate ok then we come to the second

174
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,630
part of the actual circle part which is
the curves so we have seen how the

175
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:08,080
particles are accelerated but if we just
leave them alone they just fly on a

176
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,370
straight line but we need we wanted to
go on a circle so what we need to do is

177
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:18,910
to put their a magnetic field magnetic
field if charged particle comes inside a

178
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:25,699
magnetic field it is put onto a curved
path so we need to put magnets at the

179
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,190
right strength into the path of a
particle simpatico comes flying here and

180
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:34,130
there is a magnetic field and then it
will start to go around the curve the

181
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,180
thing is that we give the particle so
much energy that they need very large

182
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,599
magnetic fields to actually turn them
you cannot just use a small magnet

183
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,310
because it will

184
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:48,410
changed the way of the particle 22
little and so we have these they're

185
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:55,020
called cryo dipoles which means very
cold magnet these are also cool to about

186
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:01,060
minus two hundred and seventy degrees
Celsius and the LHC accelerator users

187
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:08,560
about 1,200 of them all around the ring
part of the accelerator we are well they

188
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,420
are also expensive because you need the
niobium and everything so some some

189
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,860
estimates were that one of these things
cost half a million Swiss francs a lot

190
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,260
of money and to generate the field we
use a very large currents of its an

191
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,800
electromagnet have two conductors and
you put an electric current through them

192
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,800
and then in the middle there appears a
magnetic field and the magnetic field

193
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,650
should have a strength of about eight
and a half Tesla because of the strength

194
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:42,670
of eight and a half Tesla it's enough
for the protons that are going at this

195
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,349
energy where we need them to just make
the right the right angle around the

196
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,480
curve

197
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,280
well and because that's a very large
magnetic field we did a very large

198
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:58,579
electrical current and it's about to
kill em Paris 1212 killer on parasol

199
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,110
12,000 and Paris

200
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:07,459
power sockets the power connection in
your home I think at least in Germany it

201
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:13,520
will support about sixteen and Paris and
if you go above 16 emperors then fuse

202
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,439
blows out so that's quite a bit bigger
and also all around the Large Hadron

203
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:26,959
Collider 600 tons of this niobium metal
is used to make their electrical

204
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,410
conductors that we put the current
through and it's funny I looked it up

205
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:37,170
the the world production of niobium is
not very much because like I said it's

206
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:41,690
not used in very many applications and
it mostly comes from Brazil and when

207
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,700
they're rebuilding the Large Hadron
Collider they used a quarter of all the

208
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,299
world production of niobium for five
years so they were like the biggest

209
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:58,340
the biggest customer for this sort of
metal for a while and well so now we

210
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,999
have these magnets right and be cool
them down so there's no electrical

211
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:05,629
resistance we put a large current
through and this gives us a large

212
00:18:05,629 --> 00:18:11,129
magnetic field so the particles can go
in a circle and that's cool but if we if

213
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:15,469
the current is supposed to be constant
then there is a large energy stored and

214
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:21,960
this energy is actually extremely large
it's on the order of 10 gigot rules and

215
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:28,059
you can compare this energy that is just
inside the magnetic fields which report

216
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:34,029
there to be stable is equivalent to the
energy of a train with fifteen thousand

217
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:39,820
tongues you know like a big trade train
moving at a hundred fifty kilometers and

218
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,059
if you imagine a big freight train
moving at 250 kilometres it could do a

219
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:49,720
lot of damage if the energy is directed
in a wrong way so the magnets are also

220
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,769
something that we need to watch very
closely we don't want the energy to like

221
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:57,950
the cooling to fail and then a part of
this energy could be converted into heat

222
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,669
and that would be very bad and actually
we know that it would be very bad

223
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:08,450
because one time it happened the cooling
at a connection between two of these

224
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:14,340
dipole magnets did not work right and
saw this super conductivity to the metal

225
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,139
was lost and suddenly the large current
was not just flowing through but it was

226
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:23,939
flowing through in generating heat in
this heat that was generated by the

227
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,019
electric current made the liquid helium
that were used to cool everything

228
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:35,279
evaporate so imagine that half cubic
liter of liquid helium suddenly becomes

229
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:41,509
a gas well it expands very quickly and
in this incident it not only shifted the

230
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:46,109
part of the accelerator for a little bit
it also filled about a hundred or two

231
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:51,460
hundred metres of the tunnel with pure
helium just from the evaporation of the

232
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,419
cooling which is one of the many reasons
that whenever an accelerator is running

233
00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:58,460
nobody is allowed near it

234
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,440
the tunnel is closed the doors are
closed there is emergency shutdown if I

235
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,740
try to open the door

236
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,260
you cannot even take the elevator to go
down everybody needs to be away from the

237
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,910
accelerator because of these things can
happen it's not just about radiation and

238
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:19,020
particles it's also about lots of cold
things and lots of magnetic energy to

239
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,550
put it together we have this ring which
is not perfect but it's actually you

240
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,840
know it has a accelerating pardon the
curve part and together we use this to

241
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,490
make the particles going to circle and
come by our accelerating portion every

242
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:39,380
few times now if you look at the layout
of the sexual machines you will find

243
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:44,470
that often they are connected some large
accelerator is connected to some smaller

244
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:50,150
accelerators and these are called the
pre accelerators because it's useful for

245
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:54,390
us to put the particles not you know
like energy 0 there standing still

246
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,670
we put them in the accelerator and then
turn it on its better if we give them

247
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:04,490
some basic energy to say and then put it
in another accelerator which makes them

248
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,400
at a higher energy if you want to a
drive on the output you don't go there

249
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,200
and stop on the output and then
accelerate you know you go before and

250
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,270
there's a little and you match the speed
of the other cars and then you join it

251
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:21,960
and this is how we like to do it with
the particles also because it gives us a

252
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,270
chance to have a more smooth operation
of the electric fields and the magnetic

253
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,620
fields and you can see this pattern also
in the layout of some real-world

254
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:37,280
accelerator centers so this is the LHC
these are our 27 kilometers of fun and

255
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,730
as you can see it is connected to many
smaller machines and also here where I

256
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:47,790
work at easy there was a connection of
this now it's almost like a historical

257
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,800
evolution that all these smaller
accelerators are connected to larger

258
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,800
ones because when all this acceleration
business started about in the nineteen

259
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,620
fifties the machines were small because
you could find out a lot of interesting

260
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:05,600
things with a small machine but then we
wanted to go to higher energies because

261
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,790
our machine had told us everything so we
build a bigger one and we could connect

262
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,570
the bigger one to the old smaller one

263
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:17,280
and this happened again and again and
and as you can see here there's at least

264
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:24,520
1233 accelerators to the LHC which some
years ago where the biggest machine but

265
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,580
then they became just the pre
accelerator for the next big machine ok

266
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,010
now we have all this acceleration
everything is working great and the

267
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,610
particles are going really fast and here
comes the real business that we want to

268
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,399
do which is the collisions the particles
collide so we can find out something

269
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,470
about what's inside or what can happen
with the energy and it is very difficult

270
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,150
actually to make the particles collide
because they're extremely small and

271
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:58,320
extremely fast so when we try to make
coalitions we make a lot of them and I

272
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,830
will give you an overview an explanation
of actually how many of them will

273
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,080
generate but first we need to take a
look at what the beam looks like so the

274
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,629
stream of particles that we make go
through the accelerator recall and

275
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,450
actually of course there is two beams
because we need collisions

276
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:21,590
soybean miss not a continuous stream of
particles like you wouldn't I don't know

277
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,360
from science fiction the particle gun
they don't come out in a single stream

278
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:32,810
but they're also not single particles
like proton proton proton but there are

279
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:39,250
packed together in bunches and bunches
might look like this so we have a huge

280
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,030
number of protons and it slides through
and then there's a little part and then

281
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,149
there's another huge bunch of protons to
make

282
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:51,559
single particles collide is too hard we
cannot

283
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:57,039
the magnetic fields that will determine
the path to have one proton hit one

284
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:03,339
other proton it's impossible if you
calculated it's like trying to shoot

285
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:08,190
with a rifle into the air and somebody
else also shoots their rifles into the

286
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:14,320
air and the bullets are supposed to meet
in the air but if I'm here and the other

287
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,229
person is on mars it's extremely
difficult so we have like large armies

288
00:24:20,229 --> 00:24:23,749
and everybody is shooting towards Mars
and then hopefully in the middle

289
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:27,649
some of the bullets will collide and the
number of protons that we have in a

290
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:36,820
bunch like the number like the number of
bullets that we shoot its tend to the 11

291
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:43,739
so that's a hundred billion particles in
just one bunch so large branches are

292
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:49,589
made to collide or ima to meet and then
hopefully among all these two hundred

293
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:56,249
billion protons that meet there will be
some collisions so how many bunches are

294
00:24:56,249 --> 00:25:01,659
there well they're spaced apart by 25 90
seconds so I'm standing next to the LHC

295
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:06,359
when it's running which is not allowed
but let's imagine and here's a bunch and

296
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,449
I went 25 90 seconds and then there's
another bunch and that means that they

297
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:17,139
are apart by seven and a half metres and
about not quite three thousand bunches

298
00:25:17,139 --> 00:25:21,978
are in there at the same time and just a
funny fact because it's a lot of charged

299
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,649
particles moving its actually like an
electric current but the electric

300
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:30,449
current would look rather small because
even hundreds or a couple thousand of

301
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:35,369
billion protons is actually not a lot of
charge so it's like like one and a half

302
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:40,668
million pairs as the current we don't
want to you know it's not a power cable

303
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:46,249
it's an accelerator so that's ok and to
make them collide well we need to make

304
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:50,359
these beams meet and this is done at
interaction points so at this

305
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:55,279
intersection points we put special
special configurations of magnetic

306
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,170
fields because the magnetic lenses

307
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:04,940
and we make the beams meet we make them
intersect and so hundred billion protons

308
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,420
in each bunch and there is two bunches
coming one from each side and the

309
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,980
interaction point the the actual area
where they meet we make it a small as

310
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:19,940
about human hair is thick hair cut it
and the area that you get if you look on

311
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,970
that is the area where we make these two
hundred billion protons meet how many

312
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:31,330
collisions are there when we do this
well about 10 to 20 and this is actually

313
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:35,970
a bit too much for our instruments but
the number that we that we get the

314
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:41,700
number that we choose because if we make
the number less if we make it only 125

315
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,400
collisions then we don't get enough data
this way we get a little bit too much

316
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,240
data but then we try to choose we will
look at how we deal with the data so

317
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,740
yeah if there is more than one collision
per bunch crossing it's called a pile up

318
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:03,750
and it makes it harder on the on the
detectors so about 20 collisions one

319
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:09,640
collision per bunch crossing and they're
a bunch crossings every 25 90 seconds so

320
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,130
that means every second there are about
600 million collisions

321
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:21,540
600 million times per second collides
with some other protein and the

322
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,440
experiments that we used to find out
then what is happening there but this is

323
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:32,610
just one part of one of one experiment
so keep in mind how large this is we

324
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:39,689
have here people and trucks and it is
this part in that experiment and this is

325
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:45,530
one of the two machines that we have
there and the actual collisions the

326
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:51,629
actual magic happens inside this tube
it's cut open here so there's one stream

327
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,990
of particles coming from the one side
and the other is coming from the other

328
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,650
side and the collisions happen right
here in the middle and then we put the

329
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:04,560
detectors like an onion structure inside
on the very inside next to the beam is

330
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,639
the most sensitive detector and then
come other instruments and then the

331
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,560
energy and energy measurements we try to
take very close to the beach we want to

332
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,210
know very precisely where everything is
and then further to the outside we want

333
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,610
to know how much energy there is other
particles just smash into our detector

334
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:30,209
components and we can find out how much
energy they had so yet the inner

335
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,400
tracking on the inside me want to know
where everything is because of course in

336
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:41,500
the collision energy is converted into
many particles there can be 20 30 50 of

337
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,740
particles in just one collision and we
need to know where they're all going so

338
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,880
that's why we need the inner tracking
then outside for the measurement of the

339
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,060
energies is the calorimeter this is
Greek for measuring the energy so the

340
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:00,440
calorimeter as they actually stop the
particles and we can determine if we

341
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,890
stop the particle free sort of catch it

342
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:07,980
we can determine how much energy it had
by how much damage it does to our

343
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,020
detector not really damaged but still
it's it's a process that changes the

344
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,610
detector in some ways are some parts of
these calorimeter as you want to replace

345
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:24,590
every few months or years and then there
is also another thing which is also like

346
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:29,260
a calorimeter but for the muons Iran's
our special part of particles a special

347
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,770
kind of particles that can also be
generated and they go through almost

348
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:38,139
everything they can go through a lot of
led a lot of other materials so the very

349
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,480
largest part of the detectors is just
for this muon particles and we put them

350
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,550
outside of everything else they can
catch the rest they didn't get stuck

351
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:54,480
inside these other parts oK so that's
the instrumentation and like this is a

352
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,320
picture of the of the very inside of the
detector it's composed of small small

353
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:05,490
elements and these elements can see if a
particle went through and well we put

354
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:08,740
enough of them and we need to put in a
circle because particles can go every

355
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,650
way and we want to catch them in every
direction so that's why these are

356
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,269
arranged in a circle

357
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:19,769
around the beamline and then we need
triggering because let's think about how

358
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:24,209
much data is actually generated there
are forty million bunch crossings per

359
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:28,139
second and suppose that every bunch
crossing inside our detector and we want

360
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:30,070
to know what is happening

361
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:34,830
sold the detectors have a large number
of channels you know channel can be a

362
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:40,489
voltage here everyone everyone of these
small elements will have not just one

363
00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:46,029
but many channels just for itself in all
in one of these big detectors there

364
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:52,519
might be about 100 million channels and
suppose that every channel has has a

365
00:30:52,519 --> 00:31:02,089
data range of one or something so it
could be anything from like 0 millivolts

366
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:07,918
21 vault in 1,000,000 bold steps and the
net will be about a thousand bits and

367
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,599
that means that for every bunch crossing
we get about one and a half megabytes of

368
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:16,759
data that doesn't sound so bad but it
happens every 25 nanoseconds the actual

369
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:21,009
raw data that is generated all the time
when everything is running is on the

370
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:27,039
order of many terabytes per second and
we cannot process terabytes per second

371
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,999
we cannot even store these terabytes per
second at least we couldn't do it for

372
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:37,599
very long so we need to pick some of the
events we don't record everything from

373
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,418
the 60 terabyte per second

374
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,359
data stream which is thick some things
which are interesting but it's very

375
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,658
difficult to find out what is
interesting how do we choose and this is

376
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:53,899
done by something called the trigger so
the trigger is supposed to choose oh

377
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:58,908
yeah this is about the reconstruction so
one event right we have a bunch crossing

378
00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:04,529
and there's 20 events and to calculate
what happened in just one event takes

379
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:10,289
the reconstruction of these experiments
of its couple million lines of C code

380
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:15,969
that was especially written just for
this experiment and it has to simulate

381
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:19,079
many objects because of course many
things are meeting in many things are

382
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,860
flying away

383
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:28,490
and so for every one single event you
would need about 15 seconds of real-time

384
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:32,340
CPU but with six hundred million
collisions per second you don't have

385
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,770
that much computing power is just not
available so like I said we need to pick

386
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:42,900
certain events which are interesting to
us so the trigger does and most most

387
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,710
experiments uses several level trigger
system is where we tell the first level

388
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:52,760
trigger ok you see an event and now you
have 22nd 25 90 seconds of time before

389
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,280
the next bunch crossing

390
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,639
you have this much time to find out if
you think there is something interesting

391
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:05,220
there and if yes you will put it on to
the next computer or to the next trigger

392
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:11,130
and if not just throw it away and it
will eliminate more than 99% of all the

393
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:15,390
event so we are left with a smaller data
stream off about a hundred or 200

394
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:20,450
gigabytes per second but of course this
is still too much the next level traders

395
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:26,100
have a bit more time to decide they have
10 microseconds time to decide if that

396
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,469
thing which they got from the first
level trigger looks interesting or not

397
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,580
and if yes they will pass it on

398
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:36,240
so then in the end we are left with some
hundred megabytes data stream per second

399
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,490
which is okay we can manage that and
store that but then we still have to do

400
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,460
all the calculations to reconstruct what
actually happened in these events and

401
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:51,010
when we do that we can get some nice
pretty looking graphics which are like

402
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:55,260
this so this is the representation of
what happened inside the detector at the

403
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:59,549
very moment of this one collision so
here's a collision and there's some

404
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:04,020
particles flying outside and some
special particles flying further outside

405
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:09,379
because they had larger energy and there
is also one here and then if we look

406
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:14,489
from another direction it might look
like this so if we look into along the

407
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:19,850
beam it might look like this and then
the particle theorists come and they

408
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,049
look at the date of this event and they
will say oh yes I know this that's what

409
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:28,600
happened and this then will be probably
very interesting because there was a

410
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,879
Higgs boson there so out of everything
that happened

411
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:36,589
goes into the detector the data's picked
and picked again and then hopefully in

412
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:40,659
the end we will have some events like
this that we can show to the theory

413
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:44,429
people and then the theory people
hopefully we'll say yep that was exposed

414
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:49,668
so that's what we have to do and to
store all this data because there's a

415
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:55,368
lot of regenerated there's the LHC
computing grid which has a number of

416
00:34:55,369 --> 00:35:00,750
data centers around the world connected
to each other and these four experiments

417
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:07,460
they produce about 25 petabytes per year
and the LHC has been running for for now

418
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:13,730
34 years about so already we have 100
petabytes of just stuff that we record

419
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:18,400
it happening inside the inside the
accelerator I heard that now I'm not

420
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,309
sure about this maybe some of you know
better that this is among the biggest

421
00:35:22,309 --> 00:35:29,079
data collections that there is after the
end of a data collection and to

422
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:33,880
distribute all the state and restored
efficiently the year dedicated data

423
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,569
centers are connected with links that
are about as large as gigabits per

424
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:44,150
second to distribute the data I am I
have one story that I found from the

425
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:48,569
time that the LHC was constructed so
they were thinking about what we should

426
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:53,390
build and this was about in the middle
of the nineties so they said okay we

427
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:57,359
have this detector and admits to collect
the data we put it all together and we

428
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,730
will put 10 Gigabit switch but in the
middle of the nineties there were no 10

429
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:08,619
gigabit switches so like the financing
committee said well you cannot plan to

430
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:13,170
build some machine with a device that
doesn't exist they said but we asked

431
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,380
some of the network people and they said
that when we finally get to putting

432
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,799
everything together they will be
attending events which saw no problem

433
00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:24,660
well they kind of managed to convince
everyone to still put the money in and

434
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,339
luckily it happened and the really worse
which is that were fast enough at the

435
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:31,259
time that they were really putting it
together five or maybe ten years later

436
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:36,279
so sometimes even have to plan ahead to
use technologies they don't exist yet

437
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:40,000
because the whole process of thinking
about it and planning it and finding the

438
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,360
money and making the decisions so long

439
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:48,790
that technology has advanced a lot okay
now let's think about something because

440
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,690
we make the triggers choose what are the
interesting events right and we want to

441
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:58,590
find out about books about these very
interesting events but we have to find

442
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:04,970
them in this enormous amount of data and
so if the trigger throws away everything

443
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:10,839
that we tell it isn't relevant well we
choose what's relevant right so what if

444
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,340
in all this data that we throw away
their something which would actually be

445
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,410
interesting

446
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,270
reprogram it wrong and then we don't
find anything out that we wanted to know

447
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:25,280
and there is one great example from the
nineteen thirties

448
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,650
about something like this actually
happening of course this was way before

449
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:35,270
computers but still it's the same
problem in principle so this was when

450
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:39,800
people used for particle detectors they
used photographic plates you had a

451
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,670
special special kind of liquid or solid
and you put a magnetic field there and

452
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:48,700
then of particles go through you will
see it on an actual photograph so you

453
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,200
take it to a photography lab and there's
all the chemicals and then you look at a

454
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,180
physical photographing you say yes
there's a particle so here in this

455
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:01,810
photograph we can see the important
things are here this is a metal plate

456
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:09,430
and this is the track of a particle that
went through the metal plate and we know

457
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:14,160
that there is a magnetic field like this
which makes the party cannot just fly

458
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,470
straight but actually to go on this
curve and we also know that the particle

459
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:26,439
is coming from this direction because
when it hits the plate it loses some

460
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,810
energy and then the curve gets tighter
so you see first is flying like this and

461
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:36,680
then it's like more like this and that
means that it was coming from below and

462
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:43,399
hit the play it and then it's flying
above so this is like our event few and

463
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,820
because because we know it's coming from
this direction we can calculate the

464
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,810
amount of energy that it had and the
amount of energy that had lost

465
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:58,060
and we found out that this has the mass
of an electron but from the direction of

466
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:04,400
the magnetic field we also know that it
is positively charged we are actually

467
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,310
electron but not with a negative charge
like they all have but with a positive

468
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:14,690
charge so what's a positively charged
electrons right in the nineteen thirties

469
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,390
they were thinking that this doesn't
exist

470
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:21,330
you cannot have a positively charged
electrons so some genius found a

471
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:25,880
solution and he said half the picture
was just develop the wrong way around if

472
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,160
i turn it it's an electron again but of
course this wasn't the solution this

473
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:36,700
wasn't actually the case because what
they actually found was a positron a

474
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:42,960
positron is an anti electron it's the
anti-matter counterparts to an electron

475
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,180
but they were not ready to accept this
result because he was thinking well

476
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,890
looks like an electronic but it has a
positive charge so there must be some

477
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:56,700
mistake when actually it was no mistake
it was just a positively charged

478
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,370
electrons and only much later

479
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:04,700
months or years later somebody did the
experiment again and they've paid very

480
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,750
close attention to all the magnetic
fields and two other directions and the

481
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,630
currents and then they were sure well
there is no mistake in my instrument it

482
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,340
really is something like a positively
charged electrons and then that was the

483
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,560
discovery of a positron

484
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:25,620
and so that means only if you can accept
something as a result then you will be

485
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:30,700
able to publish it and well so you need
to kind of trick yourself because if

486
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:38,399
there's some result in you think it
cannot be well maybe it can be and so

487
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,540
with this very difficult process of
accelerating everything of making the

488
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,730
collisions picking out the data and then
finally putting it all together in a

489
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:53,280
theory the LHC accelerator has already
produced a large success story because

490
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,360
you see this this gentleman here which
is Peter Hicks and his colleague

491
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:03,050
montclair they were honored with the
Nobel Prize in Physics in the year 2013

492
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:08,770
after the LHC accelerator had announced
that they had actually seen the Higgs

493
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:15,230
particle and the amazing thing is that
the theory these two proposed actually

494
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:20,510
was first thought of fifty years before
so it took fifty years from the ideas of

495
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:25,180
view of these two and actually a third
guy I hope he'll be called but he didn't

496
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:30,509
make it all the way he died some years
before this discovery but Peter Hicks

497
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:34,820
and France Moncler they lived to see
long enough that this particle

498
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,890
accelerator really confirm their idea
and it was only possible because we were

499
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:43,080
always building at the limit of our
capabilities like I said the 10 Gigabit

500
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,230
switch that they thought they needed in
the middle of the nineties but it didn't

501
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:50,940
exist these accelerators always like the
the most advanced thing that we can

502
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:55,020
build and after fifty years that was
enough to confirm this series so that

503
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:01,050
was a success and so from the very start
where we say that energy is this like

504
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:06,790
the same as mass like parts as a device
we can devise these machines to actually

505
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:11,720
make the particles go in some packets
and then they collide and there is a

506
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,339
huge amount of energy and if we pick
everything right and if we think the

507
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,250
right way about the theories then we can
actually make some surprising

508
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:26,110
discoveries and the nice thing is that
when the when the Nobel Prize was

509
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:30,610
actually announced it was not just these
you know these two men celebrating but

510
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:34,120
it was actually hundreds of people
everywhere around the world and even

511
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,830
myself I was sitting in Hamburg we were
watching live stream from Stockholm of

512
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:42,259
the Nobel Prize it was like a football
game and everybody was super excited

513
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:46,810
when they announced that they had found
the Higgs boson and then later when they

514
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:50,970
announced that there was the then there
was the nobel prize given for this

515
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:55,399
theory that was confirmed there so it's
a community work of everybody's not just

516
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,340
the people who think of the theory like
the physical genius people it is also

517
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:02,770
those who construct the accelerator
those who put it together those who

518
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,130
program the software

519
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:09,050
a lot of people involved in this very
big process and it can be a lot of fun

520
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,990
when you look at it or when you are a
part of it or just to find out something

521
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:18,290
about it because it's yeah its
cutting-edge technology and so with this

522
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:22,930
I would like to thank you very much for
your attention and I will be happy to

523
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:44,930
take your questions

524
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:53,569
that are going in the opposite direction
from colliding before you want them to

525
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:55,190
collide to do it at all

526
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:59,460
yes that's right so we want the
collisions to happen only in the

527
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:04,329
collision points and not the other way
around the LHC is actually composed of

528
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:09,420
two accelerators it is one pipe and
below that is another pipe and they go

529
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:15,300
in opposite directions and only inside
of the detectors these two pipes so

530
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,599
actually you know one pipe is going like
this

531
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,059
the other papers going like this and
they don't meet but in the interaction

532
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:25,710
points we kind of open the pipes and
then there's an opening where we can

533
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:31,220
direct with magnetic fields the
particles to meet and so we determined

534
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:34,790
by the way that we construct the
accelerator where the interaction points

535
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:47,500
are and that's where we build the
detectors

536
00:44:47,500 --> 00:45:08,080
so and there are parts of that they are
accelerated in that way that you're

537
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:17,630
using alternating current are changing
the electric fields are just how do you

538
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:22,940
prevent well if they're moving in a
bunch how do you prevent some parts of

539
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:28,840
bills from being slow down and some from
being accelerated yes you need to your

540
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,760
right to need to synchronize your
electric field with the way that the

541
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,080
particles are actually moving because
that's a I want the particles to be

542
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:41,520
going along this way of the way if but
if they come too early then they will

543
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,680
not hit the right parts of the electric
field now it can happen and it happens

544
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:51,020
that some particles are being slow down
but then they they are sort of pushed

545
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:55,820
back into the next bunch it's not a nice
thing but the thing kind of it kind of

546
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,860
balances itself when you have a bunch
and some part of it is slow down too

547
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:04,510
much then it will drift all the way back
into the next punch and then hopefully

548
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:06,840
there it will fit right in

549
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,780
but it's not nice of course you want to
have a nice and clean bunches and saw

550
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:14,760
it's actually a lot of work to tune
everything right so that when the field

551
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,700
is in a special position they bunch will
actually also be in the correct position

552
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:33,839
so yeah that's difficult thing to do you
write thank you

553
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:45,920
you feeling paying your taxes then you
have to oversimplify complicated process

554
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:53,500
when you talk to general population and
thank second question is how do magnets

555
00:46:53,500 --> 00:47:03,470
how do magnets work that's too difficult
to Christian well yes you are right of

556
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:09,000
course I the presentation as much
simplified from like one guy building

557
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,620
the actual accelerator presenting it to
a bunch of particle physics people there

558
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:18,359
is almost no formula in this
presentation but I think that if you

559
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,030
want people to feel like they learn
something about an accelerator it's

560
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:26,280
better to first proposed to first
present a simple principles and then

561
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,530
later if they want to you can look at
all the formula it's all public you know

562
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:35,690
you can look at the data but if I start
with integrals and differentials and

563
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:40,960
volume integration and everything then I
think people can lose interest and so i

564
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,620
hope i don't mean to offend people when
a very simple explanations it's just a

565
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:49,910
way that I think it's good to start into
the topic and if you know already more

566
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:54,250
than that's great and you can visit
presentations may be at universities you

567
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,320
can read documents on the internet you
can read books about particle physics

568
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,180
and I think that I would like to give a
start

569
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:17,589
into this process

570
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:27,880
how do you keep good questions we have
ten billion or a hundred billion

571
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,380
electrons in this bunch right then we
want to make the bunch go through the

572
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:35,520
accelerator but they all have the same
electric charge they are all charged

573
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,560
negatively so they repel each other so
the bunch actually will not stay in a

574
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:45,299
bunch it will want to drift apart and
that's bad because our tube where the

575
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,910
particles are actually going is only
about this big so if the bunch drift

576
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:52,730
apart of the particles were smashed into
the wall and be lost from the reaction

577
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:57,910
so what we do is we have magnets called
quarter polls they're not just north

578
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:02,759
pole in South Pole but their north south
another north and another south and the

579
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,170
magnetic field that is created between
these polls is called a quadrupole field

580
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:12,940
and you can use it like a lens like the
lenses sunglasses can focus the light

581
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:18,800
these quadrupole lenses can in a similar
way also focused the path of the

582
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,780
electrons quadrupole magnets here and
here comes my bombs and it's drifting

583
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:28,890
apart but then the quadrupole magnets
makes it go together again and so all

584
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:32,650
along the path we need lots of
quadrupole magnets to actually push the

585
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:36,850
particles together even though they're
charged wants to kind of make them repel

586
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:41,240
each other

587
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:45,740
iraq's well thank you everybody and have
a fun conference
