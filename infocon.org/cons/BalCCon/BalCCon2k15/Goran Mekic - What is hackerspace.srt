1
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,479
thank you

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:36,329
space and reason when I created this
presentation may I ask myself one really

3
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:49,730
simple question well wait a stock we're
all hackers here right and right so I

4
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,260
was thinking to myself how we all know
what a hackerspace is because we were

5
00:00:53,260 --> 00:01:00,960
all hackers and we have a species to to
get around but we don't really know that

6
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,789
there are multiple reasons hackerspace
has a culture is that you in a region

7
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:13,130
still we're we're not really aware of
what the hackerspace is and just a

8
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:19,259
little bit of history it's not a long
history unfortunately we have only one

9
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:32,780
we had only one space in belgrade cold
so greetings to the guys and maybe in

10
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:43,030
town we we really don't know what that
is

11
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:51,030
unfortunately our region even doesn't
know we we needed which is logical

12
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,020
actually if you if you don't know why
it's something you really don't know if

13
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:06,929
you need it and we do trust me we do so
what is a hackerspace it's a physical

14
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:16,910
place where Hermes obviously but it's
more in that the meeting started at

15
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:26,519
least poorer for his hard where we get
bored from IRC and handles and singled

16
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:37,030
attacks and scrolling dialogue and
really wanted to know each other so we

17
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:45,530
need will really so we started local
cafes wheat beer of course it was the

18
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:54,320
only place we could actually meet
because we didn't have our own and let

19
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,680
hackers basis now it's not that much
about the space itself is not about the

20
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:08,010
physical place it's mostly about ideas
because I opened my eyes and I have idea

21
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:14,480
and unfortunately my fiance is the only
person I can talk to it at that moment

22
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,940
so I really need people to tell them my
idea and to tell me it sucks it's great

23
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,070
it's somewhere in the middle trainer's
death change that whatever just

24
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:34,269
developing ideas is an important topic
and feel about helping out

25
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:39,620
because no one in the world knows
everything and no one in the world is

26
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:50,890
without problems so we tend to to solve
problems by helping out we do have some

27
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,959
experience here to have some experience
and the mixture of dad gives better

28
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:03,990
knowledge better solutions when I said
better solutions its software or

29
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:11,870
hardware might be mechanics it can be
science physics I don't know if you

30
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:18,970
retired from our position permit easy
for example it's all about collaboration

31
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:26,390
and hard to each other and we all have
something we know we are something we're

32
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:32,990
familiar with it so we can give you
examples we can give you experience

33
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,660
where you can come and give it to us
something we never talked about and it's

34
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:49,160
super cool and support you so please do
that what does this hacker space there's

35
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:56,670
something called open houses where space
show what they been doing to the public

36
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,970
meaning not only to the people that are
really hackers basis

37
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:09,750
regular II but we having new people
drawn to the hackerspace and showing

38
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,400
them a new toy storage ideas

39
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:23,138
and whatnot whatever came to mind one of
the waste to the to learn is to have

40
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:31,030
classes so we try to give classes when I
say we this point I mean we as a global

41
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:37,258
community so their skills

42
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:47,520
ideas to classes and workshops and maybe
new harbour as long as crazy and you and

43
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:55,460
interesting it has to be fun otherwise
it's not worth it so the classes and

44
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:04,830
workshops for one way to achieve it and
collaborative projects maybe I'll I hear

45
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,880
a talk from someone and I you know how
his pace and I say ok this is a cool

46
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,889
idea I want to work earnest I want to
work with you because I like you were

47
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:23,320
what terror my my reasons for pool for
contributing to a collaborative project

48
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:35,050
and I do have examples project our own
hackerspace will talk about it later and

49
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,370
unfortunately the

50
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:44,870
financing without its always troublesome
but that's the least of our problems

51
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:56,310
it's weird but it is so fundraising
night or the nation eyes are organized

52
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:02,080
for example once a month to pay the
bills and whatever expenses we have for

53
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,320
your hardware for you why are you always
need copper you always need soldiering

54
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:15,659
soldiering Iran's whatever expenses are
you somehow have to compensate for a man

55
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:24,020
charged over the fundraising night for
the best best way to do it

56
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:40,539
from they have organized a global events
and global meetings spaces so one of

57
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:45,389
them is a call and we're trays pride
which provides an opportunity for

58
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:53,740
existing hackers basis to update and
highlight upcoming events so you can

59
00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:00,690
call people from around the world or
region or wherever to participating in

60
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:08,860
your activities you plan for for your
well for your people for your crew it's

61
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:15,949
all about your crew always there's
something called singer and guitar

62
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:25,370
guitar is when we get a room you know
room or earlier and a hackerspace today

63
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:31,380
and we were on the same problem maybe
we're not interested in the same problem

64
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,799
but

65
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,968
for example I like to see if any
solution to the problems they never know

66
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:43,149
existed for centuries him away

67
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:53,990
belgrade a nice do it together as a
region or team from from croatia or

68
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,459
whoever you you'll find a suitable to
think with and do something fun

69
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:12,630
always has to be fun there's a global
health challenges and they're held each

70
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:20,779
month and faces don't work comes up with
a challenge for around the globe and

71
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:31,700
their hearings some small prizes to win
and these global hackerspace jacket and

72
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:38,860
for our announced technical and so colin
is related place to to lerner well

73
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:46,450
what's around your work what's going on
what are the ones and looked it up space

74
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:51,079
it at work this is the number of
registers hackers basis and I believe

75
00:09:51,079 --> 00:10:00,120
there's more than it actually is not a
British number I think there are spaces

76
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:09,380
around the world at her not yet
registered so please do we actually

77
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:15,250
talked about her space as I said he is
the space for hackers but what is a

78
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,450
hiker

79
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:28,070
definitions and I didn't like any it's
hard to define where it's extremely easy

80
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:33,760
depending how how you approach the
problem one is a crazy person doing

81
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,240
hacks and its perfect definition but it
doesn't tell me anything what is a hack

82
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,810
you have to define it if you were in
ninety percent or romantic person you

83
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:54,359
you need to define things are still one
of the the quotes from her conduct or

84
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:02,510
abused its intersection between or and
computers technology anything technical

85
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,710
which is

86
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:11,760
which is sometimes beautiful let me give
you an example

87
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:23,040
you know what led later for example and
I'm sure there is an interview like its

88
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:30,990
fourth reaction by the light for example
you just spinning LEDs and threats and

89
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:38,830
it's a hack anything or somewhere in
between and his boat and it's fun

90
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:49,680
heard someone who's willing to to really
freak things into components and learn

91
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,589
about him but bring it thinks and
components is not always easy to have

92
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:04,950
social hackers have put hacking base for
example you have the that are hard to

93
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:12,520
composer of different commands this no
not always easy and society probably

94
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:18,530
doesn't like not probably certainly
doesn't like when you take taking apart

95
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:23,380
the two working and that's that's what's
it all about

96
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:32,810
system thing rebuilt again so you can
improve it or find solutions that don't

97
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:42,290
work so you know not to go in that
direction Mr again and this is we really

98
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:49,310
don't know what happened is like it's
not this is the line and on the left or

99
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:55,699
the hacker's how-to writer or not it's
something that way today

100
00:12:55,699 --> 00:13:04,529
and has its own fluctuations let me
quote for Eric Raymond Weil wrote I

101
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:10,029
don't have to do all this brutal
fascinating problems waiting to peaceful

102
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:18,079
no problem should ever be shouldn't ever
be told twice pulled over and order

103
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:25,939
really give freedom is good and energy
is no substitute for compliments so

104
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:35,019
pardon my French but one of the things
we know about hackers that they are

105
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:45,470
proof of concept or get the fuck out
your magazine

106
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:53,550
entrance so we really like to to show
what we know and to learn by example

107
00:13:53,550 --> 00:14:08,150
more than I say so and there's one guy I
really like it doesn't say he is a

108
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:14,209
Christian hacker but it's too crazy not
to be as lame as bird wing to give a

109
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:21,160
talk about the future of programming and
to quote him the most dangerous toxic

110
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,959
in-house creative person is think you
know what you're doing because once you

111
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,670
think you know what you're doing is
still looking around for ways to do

112
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:35,939
things if you want to be open and
receptive to new ways of thinking the

113
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:45,930
first step you have to say to yourself I
don't know what I'm doing and if they

114
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:51,699
have in all saying if you have a hammer
every problem looks like a nail so that

115
00:14:51,700 --> 00:15:03,570
when I say we look for when I say we
really don't know what I mean it we tend

116
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:09,730
to not know where we are trying to
persuade ourselves we don't know how was

117
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,420
the best architectural was the best
software solution was the best software

118
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:19,449
stack or whatever we're doing in order
to find new solutions different and some

119
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:25,010
of them are going to be totally cheesy
and you know not to go that way and you

120
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,710
know that's the only way you can find a
really good solution I don't know

121
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,630
anything

122
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:39,390
a little bit about acrobatics

123
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:44,850
critics is a term for more ways than
philosophy of the common in a hacker

124
00:15:44,850 --> 00:16:26,770
community which usually when you're
adamant you have a special hat on your

125
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:34,720
head and you can do wonderful things you
can wave and this this thing I'm

126
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,160
disclose her or you can do magic what
you don't want to do is wear two hats

127
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:48,150
all the time because we're had all the
time makes who for example wave for

128
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:52,790
someone at a station and you destroy the
whole universe because you have the

129
00:16:52,790 --> 00:17:01,560
power to do a similar way with addicts
do knowledge bowl

130
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,260
jarreau hackers you're smart you're
smarter than most of people and you can

131
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:13,300
hurt them really hurt it's up to you to
be good and it's up to you to find your

132
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:23,040
definition of what a good is because I
but we can agree on one single thing is

133
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:30,750
it good or bad whatever you choose its
moral ethics more than written down set

134
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,260
up rules how to behave

135
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:47,270
and we usually tactical to the degree
that agrees and fortunately more than

136
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,770
50% we're safe

137
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:57,070
fortunately I would love to see more of
our me myself i'm a musician and I would

138
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:04,300
like to see a novel ways how to record
how to reform how to use her where do we

139
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:13,800
know how to use some small machines
guitar pedals as sense for electronic

140
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,780
music whatever just make it fun make
useful

141
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:27,480
usually means we have to be we are
creating something and we need

142
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,520
technology so from our need for
technology we have a need to learn and

143
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,780
to do it on our own usually in a
community but the small community

144
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:45,420
unfortunately and we're trying to change
that

145
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:54,830
the most of our talk is going to be
about how his base helped co-found it's

146
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:05,189
another sides and I hate to say it's the
best hacker space in the world it's mine

147
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:13,280
and I'm subjective so sorry no seriously
what is it a hackerspace service we get

148
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:23,340
of people that are smart we really want
smart people really 112

149
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,570
again

150
00:19:28,570 --> 00:20:03,250
before trying and it's not a joke during
the slow people are on vacation so you

151
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:10,850
can see where we were like few months
old so we really don't know what happens

152
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:19,090
basis we are still searching for our
place in the universe is definitely a

153
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:29,269
collective effort you you don't create a
space for you because you already have a

154
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:35,220
space preowned it's called your flat and
you do all kind of funny things you

155
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,639
plant but sometimes you really need
ideas and it's always collective effort

156
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:47,370
to pay the bills to to clean to cook to
whatever comes to mind

157
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:55,250
you want to do and it's definitely a
physical place which means we were going

158
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,559
to 22 if you're interested

159
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:05,840
up to restock will we will go to
hackerspace to to see how it looks like

160
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,668
although I will show some pictures

161
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:20,230
and a little bit about tell the story
last year and almost in this room which

162
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:28,029
will give a talk about her spaces and
how cool that is so you want to push us

163
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:36,999
to creating our own hacker space and we
promise we will do it so we had to sew

164
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:44,299
the most of the team will collect areas
from loggers but we are not limited to

165
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:52,929
that as a matter of fact our storage
space helping us financially and

166
00:21:52,929 --> 00:22:01,600
collaborating with a bit their annual
basis so will not collaborating fully

167
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:11,709
but I hope it will change and i dont i
dont hackers there came to a balkan

168
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:18,450
really helped if you never created if
you have ever flown in space you don't

169
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:25,200
know what you're dealing with I didn't
know and none of my friends that we

170
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,549
really needed either people's experience
is to tell us what not to do and what to

171
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:39,149
do and what's Martin what strip it and
there's even to hacker manifesto but

172
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:44,559
I don't know the exact title

173
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:52,639
remembered guide how to create a
hackerspace so he teased you for you and

174
00:22:52,639 --> 00:23:03,508
I'm really proud of all the software or
however so I had my friend create s

175
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:14,719
wheelchairs copperplate carbon or CNC
machine we're trying to to put our

176
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:24,219
technicians to do something funny or
something beautiful and you're searching

177
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:33,809
for us this is an hour door so you can
find us more easily and this is how it

178
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:42,509
looks today just wanna room we managed
to to have an empty flat and finally we

179
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:49,960
have tables so you can sit somewhere and
chairs but you know it is thought like

180
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,070
that person like this there is peace

181
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:04,859
not visible here which is like this high
pile of blankets so because we didn't

182
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:12,019
have a chairs but we really wanted to
meet to to hang out we did it on the

183
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:19,619
floor so it doesn't have to be fancy
place although a friend of mine plan to

184
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:31,299
planet to be this is a 3d model of how
we plan to organize our space and too

185
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:37,860
many pictures but this is one of three
rooms we have called

186
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:49,479
presentation room we are planning to to
her room and room for rest so whatever

187
00:24:49,480 --> 00:25:00,760
comes to mind you can do it or you can
just cause we can do it together so what

188
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:09,870
we are organizing meetings obviously
which are every Monday at 8 p.m. and its

189
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:16,360
general me being sometimes we talk
technology sometimes

190
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:24,899
times we just train sorry or do
something that is whatever comes to mind

191
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:36,490
keeping a constant rate of meetings
means to us because we are family

192
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:51,610
ok last week you said you gonna do this
did you do things we know you don't have

193
00:25:51,610 --> 00:26:00,590
to learn them the way way that you can
visit us on some of our lectures and

194
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:10,379
maybe prove it maybe learn something but
definitely have and we do have heard it

195
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:16,289
started out of the Mondays at 8 p.m.
started out as happy times but we really

196
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:16,940
need it

197
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:28,830
something called enough time but I'm not
taking his should be happening or will

198
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,060
be happening we're just show up there

199
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:37,620
sure EDS so I might still to come

200
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:49,830
of course and we're planning her
workshops I only know one guy currently

201
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:53,879
dealing with her and you know where
hyperspace

202
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,670
who want to expand that and we're
planning on it was the finances are

203
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:09,390
appropriate we do have some projects
there is an idea of my friend we are

204
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:15,270
working on it we're hoping that in the
future there will be a crowdfunding at

205
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:22,160
least two sport is thought projects all
the money will go to a to center so we

206
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:29,540
we don't have to work on cheesy jobs and
have some fun

207
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:41,570
portion to have some fun and actually
this is my favorite part once the road

208
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:48,620
sounds like a fairy tale but when there
was a girl and I you know space we had a

209
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:54,919
discussion about quantum physics but he
doesn't have to be that I might be wrong

210
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:04,500
or I might be leaving wrong things like
bouncing off EDS I love crazy idea as

211
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,910
long as it's not normal

212
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:13,580
we love you so bring crazy and we love
to discuss about

213
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:21,980
Andrea this is our Twitter Facebook and
a website so pleased with us and give us

214
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,330
your comments

215
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:29,399
whatever the commentators we would love
to hear what you think about it and

216
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:37,200
honestly I hope there will be a lot of
questions how to start your own

217
00:28:37,200 --> 00:29:09,299
hackerspace because I know we're liking
her spaces at least in serbia thank you

218
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:24,210
I don't know or will it be opened

219
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:31,129
yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't know about
it because I still don't know where when

220
00:29:31,129 --> 00:29:32,860
we are hitting the

221
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:53,689
worried but it will definitely be opened
and what else you mentioned your

222
00:29:53,690 --> 00:30:03,350
planning workshops I guess they're not
limited to computer shops so do have it

223
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:12,860
and what kind of shops could expect I
don't know what I would like but I'm not

224
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:18,969
that much of a hardware guy I have my
own ideas for projects like my own USB

225
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:25,059
sound card which is actually a mixer but
beyond that I don't know what people are

226
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:33,330
going to give talks about her workshops
are actually something which we plan in

227
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:39,530
advance because we still don't have a
room for it so it will be at least six

228
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:46,370
months before we give up first talk or
workshop but Harper and by the time I

229
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:51,418
might learn a bunch of texts or I may
persuade you to come I know you're a

230
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:54,720
good or anyone else

231
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:03,980
so we we know what we would love to see
but we don't expect nothin yet ok one

232
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:19,340
more question what say you know I saw
match giving out keys on a couch talking

233
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:27,600
2011 9:10 I was thinking this is called
broom and I mean do teaming keys to

234
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,010
everyone so you don't even have to lock
because there's someone in there all the

235
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:40,070
time this is what we do we're lazy so if
you ask me porky three times keep it I

236
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:43,149
will make myself a new one

237
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:54,289
anyone else ok thank you a lot
