1
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:28,979
yellow this talk is about russia rising
legal error by our friend the late start

2
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:38,070
hello I hope you can hear me clearly my
name is equipped to take you can call me

3
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,410
particularly I come from

4
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:47,540
to take legal services and this is
content that we are going to talk about

5
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:54,530
today I hope that we are going to be
talking about it because I would like

6
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:09,070
you to interrupt me with questions as
soon as you have one so let's yes ok so

7
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:32,649
we are going to talk about first of all
when you enroll any law school there is

8
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,890
this lecture at let's call it

9
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:48,340
laws 101 it is where they explained to
you we're doing actual law come from and

10
00:01:48,340 --> 00:02:00,580
what they do is they show certain
hourglass and they say okay CD upper

11
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:09,929
part it is called metalloid to the
natural law it is where our law actually

12
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:22,510
comes from and that's grain of sand at
the neck of our class is where our

13
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,500
Constitution is at the day teach this in
every law schools or this is where the

14
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:37,250
Constitution is so the grains after debt
that come out of the constitutional law

15
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:44,420
and then at the bottom there is by law
for serbian audience this is called

16
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:53,048
pause icon scoffed and this legal heir
is basically that we are going to talk

17
00:02:53,049 --> 00:03:05,450
about is between a company and the
person you ok and this legal layer

18
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:13,078
actually represents legally binding
contract between two persons here we

19
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:20,610
have a natural person and here we have
no natural person corporation

20
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:29,120
or whatever in certain jurisdictions
they are called so as you can see there

21
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,530
is what we know it's right what we know
there is that all there is a

22
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:42,580
constitution there is a law that is
applicable there is violence and here is

23
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:49,120
this legal error that we are going to
talk about as you can see in lectures

24
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:57,270
they keep every of law schools they
don't address this they don't it's not

25
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:07,459
put in this hour glass it doesn't belong
there and we will see why this is what

26
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:18,120
the society makes and this is strictly
between two subjects of the law

27
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:26,770
ok so we have when you ask me where does
the right come from and where does the

28
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:38,260
contract come from it's obvious that
your rights as a person comes from the

29
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:46,250
constitution and law and by law and your
contract comes from this layer down

30
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:54,140
there so this is the difference between
a contract and writes let's start with

31
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:03,479
rights rights are legal social ethical
principles or of freedom or entitlement

32
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:16,070
basically you're right is nothing more
than what we agreed upon that we have

33
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,930
it it it is as simple as that

34
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:27,170
on the other hand contracts contract
that we as a society sorry that we as a

35
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:35,670
society agreed that we as individuals or
corporations or whoever have on the

36
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:43,870
other hand contract is basically the
same thing just between two certain

37
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:53,740
individuals so to be established by the
law

38
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,760
this contract to be recognized by the by
the Lord this contracts are simply

39
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:08,659
enforceable by the law may your rights
are also enforceable by the law but also

40
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:18,320
a kind of legal relationship that you
formed between yourselves is also

41
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:29,420
enforceable by the law so contract can
be let's call it signed can be achieved

42
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:40,390
or executed verbally or in writing or
even implied for instance when you go to

43
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:47,260
restaurant to sit and you sit there you
imply you want to make a contract with a

44
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:55,330
food provider or their you want to buy
food or beverages or whatever anyway

45
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:03,280
rights on the other hand are not that we
agree with each other there is a certain

46
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,770
system in various countries that have
so-called summer sovereignty that

47
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:16,340
provide us certain rights so

48
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:22,940
human rights are provided
internationally are they are supposed to

49
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:30,320
be providing internationally and that
human what we call a human rights are

50
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,800
fundamental rights which person his
inheritance Lee entitled simply because

51
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:43,910
of being a human being and they are
civil rights you may be heard of civil

52
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,440
rights movement several times

53
00:07:47,440 --> 00:08:00,800
civil rights are rights that give that
are also say this concretely civil

54
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,389
rights are those rights that gives us
the right to make contracts

55
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:17,300
just and to participate in a certain
degree in making law and being the

56
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,169
subject and object of the law

57
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:31,479
great example for civil rights is the
civil rights movement led by dr. Martin

58
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:40,110
Luther King junior in United States of
America where people that were black had

59
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,900
to know civil rights they had no right
to vote

60
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:50,770
day there will was not recognized as
legally binding they were outside of

61
00:08:50,770 --> 00:09:05,329
this system ok again

62
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:15,779
ok I hope I will start pushing the right
buttons what exactly is enforceable by

63
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:22,689
the law as you know judicial power is
vested in the courts of law and

64
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:31,049
enforceable by the law means that if we
are in contractual relationship we can

65
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:37,220
go to court and be sure that our
relationship or a contractual

66
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,110
relationship is enforced by that court
of law

67
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:50,110
so basically what the contracts means
they are laws between to certain

68
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:57,610
individuals whether corporations are
persons doesn't matter at least two so

69
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:03,439
that is enforceable by the wall and
where does the contract come from

70
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:16,599
well contract is firstly conceived in
some legal department of some company

71
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:25,079
then it goes to public relations
department of the company and then it

72
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:34,128
may or may not have external legal audit
this birth of contract is the most of

73
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:42,929
contracts that we see when we deal with
corporations is it is like this so they

74
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:49,679
are they have the wrong people their own
experts on various levels legal

75
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:57,988
department PR department you understand
worry PR department is important so when

76
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:04,460
you see the text is it does not look
boring or repelling

77
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:11,930
PR department is there to conceal the
most of the wheel that is going to be

78
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:19,489
applicable and enforceable by the law
the life's the life of the contract that

79
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:29,750
comes from this type of corporation for
instance gives other party nor ability

80
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:41,760
to negotiate because of unequal
bargaining position so it is in legal

81
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,400
theory it is cold fusion contract or a
take-it-or-leave-it those type of

82
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:53,920
contracts everyone here has signed at
least once

83
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:05,160
who has a mobile phone you signed it one
way or the other

84
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:19,719
who has prostate contract you signed it
personally who has prepaid card 0344

85
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:28,170
people you implied it there is no way
are you implied it wouldn't have to go

86
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,189
to sign it in person

87
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:37,010
the rules that the your carrier or
whoever is your mobile service provider

88
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:46,210
has brought wrote those those terms and
conditions that contractual relationship

89
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:54,450
applies to you whether you like it or
not but if you didn't like it

90
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,880
why did you sign it

91
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:09,480
well in serbia their three mobile phone
carriers ok for this conference for just

92
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,770
three days of this conference there is
one more mobile phone carrier within the

93
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:28,880
premises of this venue thanks to mr.
local charities but you cannot have

94
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,960
mobile home service unless you sign one
of the three I don't know in a hole and

95
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:42,430
how come so many yeah it doesn't matter
you can you can have twenty twenty five

96
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,719
companies you still have they all have
the same thing

97
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,240
ok and there is nothing you can do about
it

98
00:13:53,240 --> 00:14:00,400
one thing is very important here in
certain countries these adhesion

99
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,360
contracts or let's call it
take-it-or-leave-it contracts are

100
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:17,090
supposed to be when you go to court the
Court is suppose because you are unequal

101
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:23,620
side you're far far less stronger side
you are weaker side side of the contract

102
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:34,640
the contract will be represented in the
mind of the judge taking this into

103
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:41,480
consideration but this only applies at
least by the serbian law it only applies

104
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:51,090
to contract imperfections and holes and
contradictions or what have you

105
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:57,570
so if the contract is clear and trust me
off thirties guys are finished it's

106
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:04,130
completely clear especially if if they
had external audit then

107
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:14,900
an equal in the terms of the law and we
have growth life and death of contract

108
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:19,380
is termination one way or the other

109
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,930
termination of the contract may be
because of the breach of the contract

110
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:29,979
maybe because the time period and it may
be what have you

111
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:38,380
but this is the end of the contract or
termination of one contract can be

112
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:48,710
achieved when the same company takes to
the legal department is Intel's ok let's

113
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:54,180
make new terms and conditions and that
is how previous contract is terminated

114
00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:05,219
and here we will read the fine print

115
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:14,860
so we'll try to read the fine print

116
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:27,420
really really careful and to see what is
behind ok there are some rights that

117
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:35,589
higher given people like to call it
their god-given rights gather had

118
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:41,810
nothing to do with it as George Carlin
would say why would God give different

119
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:48,670
number of rights to different people in
different countries if their god-given

120
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,319
so

121
00:16:52,319 --> 00:17:00,680
European Union we are now talking just
about personal data in the European

122
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,260
Union there is this

123
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:11,230
Data Protection Directive and directive
works that European Union has a

124
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:18,829
consensus about directive country member
country has implemented into their law

125
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:29,168
so the objective of new directive that
is going to be imposed is to give

126
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:34,390
citizens back control over their
personal data to simplify regulatory

127
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:43,720
environment for businesses rights and
now the statist like this they are just

128
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:52,470
strict conditions under which companies
or businesses can collect data but this

129
00:17:52,470 --> 00:18:01,280
applies to European citizens and
European businesses it does not apply to

130
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,770
say New Zealand or Australia

131
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:15,860
Russian or non EU members hunches so by
law anyone that collect and manage

132
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:25,120
manages your personal information must
protect it from the misuse yeah well but

133
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:37,159
how does he or she or business jets jets
the rights to collect data on their

134
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,800
serbian law serbia was not a member of
your country is not to your country but

135
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:49,780
under serbian law we have respected this
directive and it says only with your

136
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:59,720
consent and everybody as we saw earlier
today gives consent without reading

137
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:06,480
without anything why do you give consent
because if you don't give consent

138
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:14,250
certain applications or a certain
websites that you love to use will you

139
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,910
will not use them

140
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:29,630
was there a question ok and here is how
it given when we use such we have Google

141
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:38,000
for instance it has terms and privacy
issues here is privacy policy and this

142
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:47,850
is what's basically states it states
what what Google collects basically it

143
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:54,290
collects every thing and what it use
what what is the information used for

144
00:19:54,290 --> 00:20:05,639
well it's used for basically anything
that they can imagine and when that is

145
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:10,738
passed through a legal department
through a PR department and through

146
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:16,479
external audit it looks like this we
collect your device information log

147
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:21,789
information location information you
need application numbers that means

148
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:29,989
Google knows google has to write to know
every single application that you had

149
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:37,039
and what you to review your application
if that application has a unique number

150
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:45,239
local storage we used that as Google
says Google use it only to see if you

151
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:55,549
can have more space that you have enough
space to install their applications and

152
00:20:55,549 --> 00:21:06,908
cookies and was this similar to colleges
so what Google does with the information

153
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:20,609
they combined them they combine them how
do they combined we don't know what do

154
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:27,968
they use it we don't know but they
promised that they will ask our consent

155
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:36,070
for the purpose other than set out in
this privacy policy and this Privacy

156
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:43,009
Policy is so broad that when Google ask
you for anything you just say ok

157
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:47,320
anywhere

158
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:57,350
r Google simply says that it can process
your Information other then the country

159
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:05,300
that you are a resident of that means
outside the country where you live so as

160
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:11,899
a Serbian citizens when they give my
data to Google it's gone it's gone to

161
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:17,670
Google Reader we saw that they are
processed there combines somewhere else

162
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:31,290
for the purposes that I have been I gave
consent yes I read this stuff and after

163
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:36,730
reading this I have no idea what are
they doing with my data actually

164
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:45,170
actually and this is how it is written
believe it or not this is copy paste

165
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:49,200
from their terms and conditions

166
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:59,330
this is copy paste identified this what
facebook says you have to find the page

167
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:05,659
and there is this statement and
Thursdays say that our privacy is very

168
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:16,300
important for them and that they
encourage us to this we are encouraged

169
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:22,889
to read the contractual relationship the
terms and conditions of contractual

170
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:34,600
relationships that that we get into I
mean I do understand that law text can

171
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:44,300
be boring but it doesn't mean that it
does not apply ok if you if if if you

172
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:53,049
have law on privacy or if you have a law
on gravity the same thing will apply

173
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:59,059
whether you like it or not with the
region or about it or not so you are

174
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:06,619
encouraged to read the data policy and
to use it to help you make informed

175
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:17,350
decisions what could what phase would
says how they share our content and

176
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:24,549
information basically when we delete
stuff they put it in the recycle bin

177
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:36,629
it also says that it may be used for a
period of time it doesn't say what

178
00:24:36,629 --> 00:24:47,059
period of time certain period of time
when we used Facebook application

179
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:56,379
applications they may ask us for our
permission and when we publish our

180
00:24:56,379 --> 00:25:05,309
content that means that we are allowing
everyone if we have this public setting

181
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:13,489
that we are allowing everyone who has
internet and Facebook connection to have

182
00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:16,669
access to that content

183
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:24,629
well of course it does facebook is made
for that Facebook is tailor-made for our

184
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:28,609
content to be public

185
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:39,119
why would you expect a privacy from a
network that promise is you to be seen

186
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:45,789
worldwide that promises you that the
sole goal that network is to have as

187
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:51,580
many shares likes and comments that you
may have what

188
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:58,320
also facebook says they're able to
deliver their services personalized for

189
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:05,040
personalized content and make
suggestions for you also may use our

190
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,780
information centers marketing
communications and they use the

191
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,530
information they have to help verify
accounts and activity and promote safety

192
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:27,000
and security on and off our services I i
really admire that facebook says that it

193
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,060
will use my private data

194
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:47,370
to promote safety and security of their
service how they know but this this is

195
00:26:47,370 --> 00:27:03,399
this is complete PR I didn't CBS this is
PR let's look at another network who

196
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:11,620
knows what else is 1230 OK hello is
basically a Twitter ok just a little bit

197
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,929
different

198
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:21,170
does not serve advertisements and does
not sell information about its users or

199
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:28,880
jewels on the site and third parties
they will collect non indentify herbal

200
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,350
information about pages general
geographic locations like not the city

201
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:41,080
but not street address the device we are
using an un-named anonymized version of

202
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:50,129
our IP address and addresses of web site
that referred us to their site so

203
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:59,940
if you don't have a corporation that
bases its business on the ring and

204
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:08,060
selling and marketing of and for our
information then you have this then you

205
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:13,950
have a low but clearly states that they
will not sell anything and they don't

206
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:31,480
serve advertisements and the rest sorry
that's my that's my type or so what also

207
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:41,500
they say the table protects lol users
from spam viruses identity theft illegal

208
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,700
or harmful activities and they use
information to understand how people use

209
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:56,260
the site which features words doesn't
and help develop and improve the site

210
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:10,600
features and services I'm like ok
basically people don't collect anything

211
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:19,070
about me is anonymous anonymized and non
identifiable so you actually don't know

212
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:24,850
who I am you don't even tried to know
who I am because you don't care who I am

213
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:31,969
you just want to know how I interact
with your product with your site and

214
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:40,580
want to make it better so it can be done
like that I don't see where the money is

215
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:48,740
in this model but I don't care from a
legal point of view I am perfectly clear

216
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:56,490
to conclude the contract based on this
Terms and Conditions let's goal

217
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,900
shortly to cooperate and intellectual
property

218
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:06,200
ok the definition is the rights remember
what their rights are granted the

219
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:13,790
creators and owners authorities that a
result of human sexual creativity so in

220
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:21,320
general terms that is copyright and
operates our intellectual property is

221
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:29,840
copyrights patents or patents trade
marks design rights and protection of

222
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:38,428
confidential information that is what
intellectual property is various terms

223
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:50,780
means various things for instance
copyrights when when an author has

224
00:30:50,780 --> 00:31:01,720
certain develop something whether it is
a normal or any kind of work doesn't

225
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:08,730
mean it doesn't have to be our artwork
like painting war figure or whatever it

226
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:18,429
just has to be from a human being and to
be original and to have some kind of

227
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:28,530
intellectual creativity or spirituality
in it that operate is granted as soon as

228
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:37,840
the richest is done for cooperate you
don't need to go anywhere to file right

229
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,110
to file anything to file any kind of
notice or anything to be recognized as

230
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:55,219
an author for patents trade marks design
rights jus true there are intellectual

231
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:02,600
property bodies within each country and
that gather data and they grant the

232
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,409
rights

233
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:12,100
patent is the right that or invention
for instance is the right for twenty

234
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:18,159
years when you make a pet Peyton so you
have exclusive rights to collect money

235
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:32,850
of its usage trade mark is right of
certain business to sell its products

236
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:45,000
under certain name or brand or trade
mark so it has a label of quality to it

237
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:55,230
it also has to be registered design
rights also protection of confidential

238
00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:02,670
information does not have to be
registered but it more or less fits into

239
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:09,010
law intellectual property rights so
let's let's let's see the fine print

240
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:16,550
how is how are co-operating intellectual
property dealt with here

241
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:23,409
Facebook we specifically give the
Facebook the permission to subject our

242
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:31,730
subject to our Privacy and applications
settings we grant them non-exclusive

243
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:37,660
transferable sub licensable free
worldwide licenses to use any

244
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:46,120
intellectual property content that we
post or in connection with Facebook that

245
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:57,110
means what ever ever anything you post
on Facebook it's theirs it's there's

246
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:03,429
also it is yours but the players

247
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:10,730
doesn't mean that you don't have certain
moral rights to it

248
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:18,090
certain legislations recognized moral
rights but Facebook doesn't say anything

249
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:23,050
about moral rights to be recognized as
an author etcetera etcetera

250
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:27,870
they're not interested in that they're
interested in

251
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:33,359
royalty-free worldwide license
sublicense double non-exclusive

252
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:45,620
transferable and what they say at the
end this License ends when we delete our

253
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:53,600
IP content or our can count unless our
content has been shared with others and

254
00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:07,160
they have not deleted it does get just
the question does this ever ever come

255
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:14,500
comes to reality is is this even
possible to have can I have your

256
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,550
question

257
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:35,940
know it's another contractual party yeah
Instagram basically says nothing this

258
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:45,970
this is nothing it says it doesn't
mention or what facebook says that we

259
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:53,049
give or we do not give it it cannot be
farmed but we weren't we represent and

260
00:35:53,050 --> 00:36:00,210
warrant that we have the right to post
their content that means that we do not

261
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:10,160
reach anyone else is copyright and that
by doing this we don't violate

262
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:18,450
misappropriated or infringe on the
rights of any third parties and what it

263
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:26,649
says that if we do that we will have to
pay or all royalties fees and any other

264
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:38,900
monies owed by reason of the content you
post on or through the Services and we

265
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:46,790
we basically represent that we have
legal rule out right income capacity to

266
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:55,330
enter into contractual relationship with
them as Facebook Instagram is not for

267
00:36:55,330 --> 00:37:05,310
persons under 13 years of age so let's
say there is a child that is eight or

268
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:12,650
ten years of age and it legally
represents that it has legal capacity

269
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:20,970
and right to enter into these Terms and
Conditions what will happen

270
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:29,819
under their terms and conditions they
dont care its not applicable day just

271
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:36,170
don't go there then they they're not
interested in that they covered

272
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:46,130
themselves with this as we know kids
like 10 year olds cannot have

273
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:54,080
contractual relationships why they are
too young they don't have that right yet

274
00:37:54,080 --> 00:38:02,990
they are represented by their parents
and what this does

275
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:14,979
basically it's a void and it will be
decided from case to case later what is

276
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,420
right to action

277
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:28,109
certain right for instance to file a
lawsuit is not right to action so means

278
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:38,040
that I as a citizen has a right to sue
someone that reaches the contractual

279
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,820
relationship or breaches my rights

280
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:54,619
important thing is to to recognize here
and european-based legislative

281
00:38:54,619 --> 00:39:03,890
legislature there are two types of
Rights absolute rights and relative

282
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:13,310
rights absolute rights are those rise
you cannot give away and rights to file

283
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:18,630
a lawsuit is one of those rights you
cannot

284
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:27,440
waive your right not to be a person you
cannot waive your right to own things

285
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:37,940
you cannot waive your right on your body
or to live in USA for instance you can

286
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:45,059
wave in certain jurisdictions over there
there are there is no distinction

287
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:51,220
between there is no distinction between
absolute and relative rights or rights

288
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:58,259
are relative that means if they're given
to you you can waive them

289
00:39:58,259 --> 00:40:08,279
ok I don't mind and their serbian the
Constitution everyone is entitled to

290
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:12,210
equal protection of his rights and
proceedings before the court of law

291
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:25,460
so you cannot waive your right to file a
lawsuit away and even if you do it's now

292
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:36,000
in void what I because it's an absolute
right let's see you as definition the

293
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:44,000
right to file a lawsuit is the privilege
of is instituting a lawsuit arising from

294
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,640
a particular transaction or state
effects such as that are based on their

295
00:40:51,640 --> 00:41:00,609
contract or torture civil wrong it's a
privilege it's it's it's not given right

296
00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:07,529
what his favour under United States law
intentional relinquishment of a ride

297
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:16,190
claim of privilege the voluntary
surrender of the normal right either by

298
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:31,480
x-press statement or by your conduct
such as not enforcing the right yes

299
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:38,990
the question is can I give someone right
to kill me that right is called

300
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:49,009
euthanasia ok but I can give you I can
donate to my right to say this computer

301
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:58,800
it does not stop me from being the
bearer of the rights of ownership it

302
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:09,580
just stops me from being owner of this
computer so that is big difference that

303
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:16,119
is that that is huge difference so let's
see how the fine print

304
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:24,260
does Google some jurisdiction provides
certain weren't is like implied warranty

305
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,490
of merchantability fitness for a
particular purpose and non-infringement

306
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:36,479
to extent permitted by law we exclude
all warranties all claims arising out of

307
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,650
or relating to these Terms of Service
will be litigated exclusively in the

308
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:48,300
federal state of course of Santa Clara
County California USA and UN Google

309
00:42:48,300 --> 00:43:00,230
consent to personal jurisdiction in
those courts sober like let's say Google

310
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:06,930
has done me wrong has reached my rights
or even has breached its on its own

311
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:14,259
terms and conditions with me what am I
supposed to do you go to Santa Clara

312
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,530
County file a lawsuit

313
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:20,750
let's see the others

314
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:33,620
Facebook if you are a resident of the
United States or Canada you are in

315
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:38,759
agreement with Facebook incorporated
otherwise you are in agreement with

316
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:47,430
Facebook garland limited if they failed
to enforce any of their rights it will

317
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:55,109
not be considered as a waiver so if the
law says what the river is to just say

318
00:43:55,110 --> 00:44:11,020
we do not consider our lack of lawsuits
to be a waiver of the right even if even

319
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:22,590
if it's written and we all agree to
submit to the personal jurisdiction of

320
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:30,680
the laws of state of California and
Northern District of California that is

321
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:37,009
located in San Mateo County so

322
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:46,130
everything they did is also without
regard to conflicts of law provision

323
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:54,880
conflicts of law is how do you settle if
different people have different rights

324
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:06,490
in each country has kind of law on
resolution of conflict of laws ok and

325
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:14,629
they just said Oh resolution of conflict
of laws will just restrict disregard

326
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:24,010
that the jurisdiction as in San Mateo
County and you agree to submit to the

327
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:41,550
personal jurisdiction and a story yes
please

328
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:50,470
question question was if Google wants to
sue me as a resident of serbia what

329
00:45:50,470 --> 00:46:01,049
court is what will apply it applies over
there but they don't they don't sue they

330
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:19,480
adjust your service they terminated the
contract and

331
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:25,050
please find the difference between
criminal actions and the civil actions

332
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:36,690
if you do something criminal through
damn they will file a criminal court

333
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:44,430
action where you live this is just for
contracts this is what we World War on

334
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:56,750
Terror early sign and agreed to without
reading and it still is construed as we

335
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:09,660
agreed to it and read it is still
applicable Twitter

336
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:18,170
the waiver is not waver ok there is no
such thing and that is why they alright

337
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:27,190
but ok and it will be governed by the
laws of state of California located in

338
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:37,420
San Francisco County and we you waive
any objection as to inconvenient forum

339
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:47,680
inconvenient forum means that was this
morning it's so so great

340
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:59,750
inconvenient forum is a place venue that
is in our minds inconvenient for us to

341
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:09,170
have resolution dispute resolution
settled or this dispute resolved and

342
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:18,470
it's not that we agree upon that we will
be under jurisdiction in San Francisco

343
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:31,439
County very clever we waive their rights
to a projected to such jurisdiction

344
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,440
I think

345
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:42,060
so far that Twitter has the most
creative legal team of all these

346
00:48:42,060 --> 00:49:01,490
companies so you do not submit yourself
to waive the right to object type your

347
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:08,689
paid consumers cross co-branded services
we are contracting to Microsoft to

348
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:17,700
Luxembourg for all other services we are
contracting with the Redmond why is this

349
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:32,290
because they bought Skype and it was
easier for them to leave as it is then

350
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:42,270
to change the venue anyway we and they
irrevocably consent to the exclusive

351
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:48,630
jurisdiction and venue to the state or
federal courts in King County Washington

352
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:57,119
for all disputes arising from them and
was this excluding arbitration in small

353
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:05,730
claims court ok another one

354
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:10,400
on to the extent permitted by law

355
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:19,080
LinkedIn shall not be liable to you or
other for any indirect etc etc etc

356
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:24,130
losses opportunities reprimanded
punitive damages whatever they are not

357
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,490
reliable

358
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:32,759
was this some laws do not allow the
limitation or exclusion of liability so

359
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:39,780
these limits may not apply to you for
instance serbia law does not apply does

360
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:47,150
not allow the limitation or exclusion of
liabilities serbia law says whoever you

361
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,310
are

362
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:58,730
are always liable for the damage that
you do voluntarily and knowingly and by

363
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:07,359
your gross negligence in those two cases
you are always liable and they say okay

364
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:16,359
where if the law allows we are not
liable we are just liable if we have to

365
00:51:16,359 --> 00:51:22,990
be liable and again

366
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:29,868
personal jurisdiction in those courts
where is Santa Clara County know this is

367
00:51:29,869 --> 00:51:32,280
very interesting

368
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:42,540
these are terms and conditions for New
Zealand and it is the subject of the law

369
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:51,630
of the Meadowlands and all disputes will
be resolved exclusively by the competent

370
00:51:51,630 --> 00:52:01,200
court in Amsterdam the Netherlands can
you imagine

371
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:12,819
a New Zealand their user of going to the
other ones just to resolve the dispute

372
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:31,100
so you can see that even if you take for
instance for London or for UK

373
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:38,040
terms and conditions those terms and
conditions are also setting the

374
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:50,759
amsterdam has the jurisdiction of for
resolving disputes yes

375
00:52:50,760 --> 00:53:02,550
yes yes yes but the service or
application will be set and settled

376
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:07,780
exclusively by the competent court in
Amsterdam unless we notify over within

377
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:14,330
one month after invoking its rights to
pursue this provisions to commence court

378
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:18,920
proceedings in Amsterdam then they're
the ones that you demand settlements of

379
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:25,810
dispute claim or controversy at hand
before the relevant court of competent

380
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:32,000
by law it took me and this is my job

381
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:40,770
about half an hour to resolve and the
result meant is this as many other cases

382
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:43,620
simply do not

383
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:52,270
Charles they do not come through they
don't become fact ever like if you

384
00:53:52,270 --> 00:54:01,480
delete your website or Facebook content
it will be deleted as as a recycle bin

385
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:10,790
and your intellectual property right is
your respect your revoke the license no

386
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:19,340
problem if it's not shared or viewed or
whatever by anyone else it's basically

387
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,680
the same thing

388
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,850
ok and they are

389
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:32,940
intelligent people that basically
realized this and this morning I had a

390
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:41,600
conversation with then fix and he said
this if it it's free if it is free QR

391
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:58,000
codes so all those services mention or
free well someone is paying for them and

392
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:16,890
that someone r us by our information our
date are our artwork are writes about

393
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,040
rights

394
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:25,580
this is what I mentioned George Carlin
said either we have unlimited rights or

395
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:37,500
no rights at all I personally as he
client that we have rights that are

396
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:49,730
limited by the rights of others and
there is what this has to be put with

397
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:58,060
end this contractual relationship that
is what we have to put in until we reach

398
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:06,049
that balance like no you cannot possibly
deprive me of me as a serbian of my

399
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:12,700
serbia let's call it God given or
constitutional given rights to have a

400
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:22,270
trial to have a public trial I given
that right because I was born here and

401
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:29,380
I'm a national of Serbian I'm additional
of Serbia and just because I click

402
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:34,670
somewhere and say I agree with or
without reading it should not be

403
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:39,700
depriving me of those rights

404
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:48,189
well last year I talked a little bit
about the golden rule

405
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:56,120
who knows who what what the golden rule
is ok for those who don't know the

406
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:04,330
golden rule is who has the gold makes
the rules ok it seems it it just seems

407
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:12,348
that the corporations are the ones with
the goal but

408
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:22,099
we're actually does that gold does that
money comes from that they aren't they

409
00:57:22,099 --> 00:57:33,920
printed well in the United States yes
but how do they become rich we give them

410
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:49,970
we give them nowadays we don't give them
money we give them our rights sometimes

411
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:59,640
irrevocably sometimes but the
legislative power in my humble opinion

412
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:08,788
is still within the people is still
within one way or the other

413
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:15,960
it does not mean that we are going to
choose I don't know 100 or 250

414
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:24,069
parliament members that will be very
wise and that will make the law for the

415
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:25,329
people

416
00:58:25,329 --> 00:58:33,729
justly or whatever I just think that our
legislative power is within the Golden

417
00:58:33,729 --> 00:58:40,618
Rule and ok you want me to give you what
my credit card number my name my

418
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:49,630
complete data my complete life and no
gonna happen I don't use Facebook for

419
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:59,109
many years I used it and I stopped and
it was kind of a relief

420
00:58:59,109 --> 00:59:06,880
first it was very strange like nobody's
poking me nobody is messaging me and

421
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,069
then I saddam I mean I'm just not there
why I don't like your terms and

422
00:59:12,069 --> 00:59:18,380
conditions I don't like to be the
subject of this contractual relationship

423
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,780
and I do have a choice

424
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:33,890
I like mobile phone carriers but mobile
phone carriers are only allowed to make

425
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:41,009
contractual relationship and as any
other corporate corporation read in the

426
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:50,950
law you saw them say where the law if
it's applicable by law if the law allows

427
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:58,790
then we are not liable for any damages
what if there is no such thing what if

428
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:04,660
you are liable for your own these
corporation or not and you cannot ask

429
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:11,319
anyone to read that right and beirut of
that right is Nolan wore it that would

430
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:15,590
bring back the terms and conditions

431
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:24,550
back to benefit of all of us and I still
have no question no answer to the

432
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:33,430
question who will win all I know is that
small battles are being one from tight

433
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:41,009
from time to time in small battles are
being lost from time to time I would

434
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:46,750
like to thank you for the tension and
I'm for you to answer your questions

435
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:56,349
that you may have

436
01:00:56,349 --> 01:01:03,210
yes please

437
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,509
I will repeat the question

438
01:01:05,509 --> 01:01:16,859
didn't want to talk very much about
criminal law but there is one thing

439
01:01:16,859 --> 01:01:20,119
which is very interesting in Germany
right now and I would like to hear your

440
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:25,079
opinion about it because German law says
that if you run a web site like Facebook

441
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:30,609
does our responsibility to remove
certain content if yes inciting racism

442
01:01:30,609 --> 01:01:36,299
hatred these things but Facebook has
their community rules which are very

443
01:01:36,299 --> 01:01:41,038
specific and in Germany there's a lot of
discussion that they will remove any

444
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:46,299
picture with naked skin but not pictures
of other hitler and concentration camps

445
01:01:46,299 --> 01:01:50,739
in these things so the German government
is making very loud noises that they

446
01:01:50,739 --> 01:01:55,169
want to hold Facebook responsible and
even the justice minister of germany has

447
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:56,589
said that tomorrow

448
01:01:56,589 --> 01:02:01,479
unknown on Monday he will meet with
Facebook but what does that mean do you

449
01:02:01,479 --> 01:02:02,799
have an idea what it means

450
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:07,999
can Germany filed a criminal action
against Facebook in Ireland I would like

451
01:02:07,999 --> 01:02:15,808
to hear your opinion it it has many many
many aspects one of them is censorship

452
01:02:15,809 --> 01:02:26,389
do you want to have facebook segregated
by the countries that that that means if

453
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:33,009
there is a face in iran or I don't know
rhodesia or wherever you may not post

454
01:02:33,009 --> 01:02:43,889
that users cannot be female you want
that basically means that Facebook will

455
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:51,659
have facebook for Germany with German
applicable laws and principles embedded

456
01:02:51,659 --> 01:02:56,200
within the service and

457
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:02,500
other rules for other countries that it
is interested in having business with so

458
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:08,910
so that's a first and that is a slippery
slope in my humble opinion is so

459
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:18,810
slippery slope for censorship second
thing I do not see Facebook really

460
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:29,820
Facebook or any other service liable for
the content it did not create I

461
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:38,670
the liability has to live within the
person who posted that content I do not

462
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:48,369
see as I don't see violent movies being
liable for domestic violence I i simply

463
01:03:48,369 --> 01:03:56,160
don't see that the person that we are
going to prosecute is the one who pleads

464
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:07,220
his wife and children not not the movie
maker so saying that basically Facebook

465
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:16,459
makes this happened because platform
people are still going to do all over

466
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:23,450
the buildings or all around the world
because it's the ideologies so is that

467
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:28,700
architect of that Assad liable for the

468
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:40,779
that is sprayed on the facade I don't
think so that I don't think so but what

469
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:50,690
I think that it should do this often
happens in diverse

470
01:04:50,690 --> 01:05:01,290
societies that have a strong feeling of
self regulation on Twitter you can see

471
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:12,470
certain movements and certain
condemnations of certain feeds or tweets

472
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:21,560
just like that just just in the instant
so I think that basically Germany wheel

473
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:33,410
it has enough power to impose its own
regulations to be worldwide because what

474
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:41,259
I see in that particular case that
regulation should be mean denial of the

475
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:49,390
Holocaust should be prosecuted and
Facebook has to make this easier but to

476
01:05:49,390 --> 01:06:01,368
ask for Facebook to delete any or not to
publish any such content is going into

477
01:06:01,369 --> 01:06:07,510
censorship just like that you know I
would never trust a corporation with my

478
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:16,880
right I would never sue me let's go to
criminal court find me I wrote you go to

479
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:25,140
jail just don't make that policy up
front I i dont need that that kind of

480
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:27,680
filter in advance

481
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:41,100
okay thank you I hope this this sensor
was satisfying anymore

482
01:06:41,100 --> 01:07:25,560
and if you want to make it costs nothing
it costs almost nothing to register any

483
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:34,730
creative domain name to find cheap web
hosting to implement some free Wordpress

484
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:43,000
or whatever you have or just to post the
pictures make your own make your own

485
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:50,170
portfolio I don't understand why do you
need Facebook on Facebook is visible so

486
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:57,000
what even if you have to use Facebook
use it with links so you make your

487
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:07,030
portfolio on your hosted website on your
domain that is on your name and wing and

488
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:14,500
it will have more or less the same
impact as today Google search will index

489
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:20,950
everything whether you like it or not
you will be there you will be visible so

490
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:30,929
you don't need there is no need to give
them those rights ok

491
01:08:30,929 --> 01:08:39,469
not sure how to bring the biggest power
companies like Google Twitter Facebook

492
01:08:39,469 --> 01:08:47,109
etc is that they correlate information
essentially dare surveilling you and to

493
01:08:47,109 --> 01:08:50,839
my best knowledge there are two
documents like the European continent of

494
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:57,568
human rights in the UN Declaration of
Human Rights specifically state that our

495
01:08:57,569 --> 01:09:02,639
too shrill people is very much limited
and definitely does not lay by those

496
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:09,479
companies it also says those riser in
1818 double meaning you cannot write

497
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:13,049
them off or sell them which is
essentially what you're doing

498
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:19,528
by agreeing to and how come that
national laws actually allowed is why

499
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:20,759
wow

500
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:30,788
international law forbids it is it it it
it doesn't permit it's it's a simple yes

501
01:09:30,788 --> 01:09:36,749
we are doing surveillance without a
court order but it's not like we are

502
01:09:36,749 --> 01:09:44,599
surveilling you came to our US you came
into contractual relationship with us

503
01:09:44,599 --> 01:09:52,429
you agree that we will do whatever we
are doing with your data and that's the

504
01:09:52,429 --> 01:10:00,499
outcome just it's it's it's just when
when you r us to rise this this legal

505
01:10:00,499 --> 01:10:05,570
relator 22 to the extent that there is

506
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:10,409
million dollars within one thought then
then you can start to think and see and

507
01:10:10,409 --> 01:10:16,730
ask questions like that is this
basically surveillance with adult court

508
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:27,549
or is this contractual relationship that
needs to be enforced by law or is it a

509
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:38,050
breach of other god-given right so there
is also question of economic power and

510
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:53,710
and everything else you're welcome I can
you talk to the Mike please

511
01:10:53,710 --> 01:11:06,130
ok so you give an example of all of us
have signed contract and you get to use

512
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:13,989
a prepaid prepaid phone number yes yes
from our carrier that we implied

513
01:11:13,989 --> 01:11:22,709
contract yet so what kind of contract
and I imply I played implied means

514
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:29,260
non-verbal and it's not in writing

515
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:40,900
applicable means that you by Serbian
language it is called concluded that I

516
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:53,730
did you made a move or any act that can
be interpreted as conclusion or

517
01:11:53,730 --> 01:12:07,599
execution of the contract so if you buy
a prepaid SIM card to use and put it in

518
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:14,340
mobile phone and use it it implies that
you want to use that mobile phone

519
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:20,620
carrier it doesn't mean it simply does
not mean that you want to use the other

520
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:26,970
ok so the rules apply

521
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:35,970
nevertheless there are rules apply in
that case too so this is informal way of

522
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:43,050
completing the contract it is known
season since the Roman law it is way the

523
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:52,900
law works ok but for example when you
sign-up postpaid contract you sign in

524
01:12:52,900 --> 01:13:00,049
for one or more years right but when you
buy a SIM card not have to register to

525
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:07,350
given your data so in which cases in
which case is that a contractor applied

526
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:08,380
for

527
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:13,020
if I mean I can take out my battery of
my phone and I use a prepaid card is

528
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:18,310
that contract still apply to lower it
still applies it still applies because

529
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:22,720
you are the subject of their contract
they don't have to know your name your

530
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:29,150
address your anything goes my sim card
just to be brief

531
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:39,700
when you go to restaurant and does the
waiter nor your name address and if they

532
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:47,280
know is that the contract yes because
you're obliged to pay for the the prices

533
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:54,389
that you're reading the menu so it's it
and they don't need to know your name or

534
01:13:54,390 --> 01:14:00,160
address or anything because you have to
pay first and then use the service they

535
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:06,820
don't care who you are in EU there is a
long but it has anti terrorist

536
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:14,110
background you need to sign your name to
the clerk that sold you a prepaid card

537
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:20,160
so they know give copy of your passport
or I D

538
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:26,720
if you go to Greece you cannot have
domestic card if it's not copied from

539
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:33,510
Europe without a passport photocopy so
in some countries they asked they want

540
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:39,880
to know your identity in some others
they don't care because why did you pay

541
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:44,530
them first and then you can use only
what you paid for it they don't care who

542
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:48,830
you are but their rules still apply

543
01:14:48,830 --> 01:15:01,519
ok otherwise you would not know how much
one minute costs that everything thank

544
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,060
you kindly for your attention
