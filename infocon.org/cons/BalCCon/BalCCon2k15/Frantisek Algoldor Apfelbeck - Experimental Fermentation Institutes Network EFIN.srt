00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,780
hello everyone welcome to the dark about
experimental fermentations center

2
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:34,040
network by Frantisek so please read and
enjoy the doc thank you very much too

3
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:42,650
low thanks for coming because of the
very low level in night yesterday

4
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:52,980
of iraq your side beer I will be relaxed
third try to recover this presentation I

5
00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:00,199
did on the CCC camp this summer and at
MRM CD last week so this is a thirty day

6
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,310
so I hope I'm finally getting to the
shape design is basically about what I

7
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:11,539
want to do you know in the next several
years starting as soon as possible but

8
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:17,140
in the months and you see the title
experiment the fermentation that work

9
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:23,619
but as an introduction for the ones who
don't know me yet

10
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:28,869
my name is fun to shake up the back are
you saw gold or in the computer or so

11
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:35,810
fragile hold up my background check so
former czechoslovak no Czech Republic I

12
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:42,979
have education in biotechnology genetic
engineering and I was working for

13
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:45,070
several years in the economy

14
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:53,080
three departments in the Republic of
Ireland I left leader Aung started to

15
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,460
travel around the world and got involved
with sustainable development and

16
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:03,580
especially the slow food and later on
with fermentation so actually I did

17
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:09,100
order fermentation the economy but later
on I move came back to it again and I

18
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:15,570
focus on food and beverage fermentation
I got involved Hecker's

19
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:22,730
2009 2010 in the San Francisco in
California in his break through

20
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,109
deliveries groups which I was already
kind of you know in touch for several

21
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,760
years on the error in the time preparing
a project of multimedia center actually

22
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:40,120
in a way a small which was very drastic
you know how it was done and I stay

23
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:48,480
since then because I enjoyed a movement
and basically fully involved now

24
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,510
base it's an example busy I would say
introduction also

25
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:02,350
movement you can see on the screen just
the basic points we focus as a group of

26
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:08,510
people who are you to food drinks or
bringing this to the heck was seen

27
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,290
trying to basically gone by

28
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,209
engine knowledge of our ancestors hardy
made firm edition of fruits you know

29
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:22,049
which the design and technology so
trying to move it forward respecting the

30
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:28,950
past into more month to reserve future
we do it through the activities at

31
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:35,149
international conferences like you know
a modern city here so the emergency laws

32
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,090
here you know about

33
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,849
and retry also promoted in the local
spaces trying to set up in all small

34
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,470
indoor

35
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,620
brewing corners make the food you know
for a membership meetings make the

36
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,489
workshops on how to make be overcome
with joy and all your sushi and bringing

37
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:59,879
basically food drinks into the second
movement and trying to use the things

38
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:06,260
which directors you know basically are
known for doing the Linux you know

39
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:12,019
open-source electronics upon this
beautiful and rings because they are big

40
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:17,120
corporations they're basically really
city on most of the knowledge patterns

41
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,930
and everything and I believe that it
will be good for the community also get

42
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,030
involved in this

43
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:31,859
so this would be the basic there are few
examples like you know we are making for

44
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,620
the fermentations building in the
incubator so making the PCB board I have

45
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,750
a prototype Syrian all now doing final
programming so it's kind of character

46
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:46,889
generation probiotic drinks and
everywhere downstairs drink today you

47
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,940
can try some of our company just
providing drinks you actually run close

48
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,310
to 200 litres of providing drinks at the
CCC can and we still have some you know

49
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,099
from the truth of time and some doing so
can come and taste you know I think so I

50
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:05,539
don't so basically kind of building to
community can often or making it happen

51
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:11,969
in the casino now then seek drops its a
group which we do with microphone

52
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,940
recorder basically it's similar thing
but in a career and partly it's also

53
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:25,969
about the business because we are trying
to cover living so we do arise beers

54
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:31,410
beers you know going for market
workshops you know things like that I

55
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,789
have been out there for two and a half
years in Korea now I would be leaving

56
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:39,710
soon because for me

57
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:46,900
environment was not very I would say
friendly concerning doing creative stuff

58
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:56,250
in a breakaway more like open mind relax
not a hero structures today is several

59
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:02,510
decades behind her so she can of
developments and are still very strict

60
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:08,300
about like a really special here are
here now and excited so anyway long

61
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,790
story short for nearly three years
around three years we have been playing

62
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:21,060
basically what I want to do in Europe in
Korea and we got some kind of lets

63
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:29,460
results which I would say that the
knowledge and experience and realizing

64
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,280
that for example for what I want to do
the experiment affirmed addition center

65
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,960
which basically did there and I'll
introduce you need to be involved on

66
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,000
everyday basis

67
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,830
come to a bit later on which means
production things you know has to be

68
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:54,010
done a regular now just what is it
experimentation from addition Center in

69
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,870
a simple way of warts it's something
with this around for thousands of years

70
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,400
since ancient times and people are
fermenting they would be coming together

71
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,620
and drink stuff together that's natural
stuff from making the bread you know in

72
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,570
ancient Egypt in 02 making beer
Mesopotamia and meet you know even

73
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,370
before you know this is something that
has evolved tradition now offers the

74
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,830
firm models for you know for example you
can sing about monasteries I'm not so

75
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,919
sure what disaster for example here in
serbia or former yugoslavia but in check

76
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,690
and Western Europe you have monasteries
which are hundreds years all and had a

77
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,420
ver basically really promoting

78
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:40,680
doping are fermentation which is what I
am really after an amazing way you know

79
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,370
beers yesterday and day before who was
downstairs we have been tasting Belgium

80
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,940
beers you know which are really having
hundreds of years of tradition made by

81
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,950
the monks the recipes were developed

82
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:00,550
they've basically did the education they
spread the knowledge Iran so for me

83
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:06,710
amazing like medieval monastery it take
for example in order staff you know 1124

84
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,370
his brother on 1300 something like you
know your 600 years of tradition

85
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:18,380
basically that's affirmative action
violence and is there is in modern times

86
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,610
you have business base academic
nonprofit are many ways I was involved

87
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,960
Academy so I can just talk a bit about
that very great resources academic

88
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:34,049
research has lots of money is basically
collected by you from your texts so

89
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:39,699
either way it's got a type of crowd
sourcing even if you don't hold it there

90
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:46,120
are some disadvantages alike I put out
let's say 10 years for ten years you

91
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,400
need to be involved I would say minimal
to be able to do something like you know

92
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,930
you will not get really green light
before then you have to work under

93
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,390
someone or some other project so you
have to invest a lot of time and energy

94
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:06,120
to be there on to get the permission to
do something truly that's one second day

95
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,950
here are here

96
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:13,320
Academy has quite also here and there
are so dead actually it's killing a lot

97
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,970
of great scientists they find out
seventy percent of the time for example

98
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,780
later a higher positions day have to
write something for you

99
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,839
grands whatever and they don't
researcher surely I like this with the

100
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,190
second movement

101
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,720
you can do things much faster they are
not so many resources that's true they

102
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,209
are building up you can see that so the
resources our

103
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:45,109
yes but your chance to do something it's
much higher and especially the community

104
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:50,939
places and resources are accumulated so
actually you don't have to be ordered by

105
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:55,740
order infrastructure united to be around
for several years you can actually come

106
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,139
in a few months you can come up with
something and try something and it's ok

107
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:04,509
it's actually a whole must like it so
did something I really enjoy and

108
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:06,459
basically trying to do these things

109
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:13,518
activities in the spaces you know so if
you have your electronic lab space I do

110
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,389
believe you can have a nice kind of
experiment actually can do really cool

111
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:22,220
stuff so this is more or less you know
part of that so just what is it you know

112
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,309
to describe from my point of view

113
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:29,069
experimentation kind of you know from
addition center its physical and virtual

114
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:33,069
to physical you can imagine just kitchen
nice little group picture of it and all

115
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:39,290
that kind of stuff you what you need in
Turkish like you know benches you have

116
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,449
your fire in order to make the stuff you
have fuel low temperature taken or

117
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:49,859
whatever and something soon no extra of
course because you can build then you

118
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,740
will have small by let you know just to
check things like you know if you want

119
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,100
to measure pho you want to see what type
of microbes in you should be able to

120
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,929
check it all so that will be the
experimental kind of you know spot for

121
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:09,449
sure when you like especially have some
room very can invite ten fifteen people

122
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:10,990
and do something

123
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,350
teach learn you know him on that same
thing it can be sure of course you know

124
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,549
to bigger tables away you can get people
together and you teach them for some

125
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:25,589
political you make beer you know you
know the one afternoon they've learned

126
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:29,299
the basics of at home they can kind of
repeated by themselves

127
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:35,939
the virtual part it's basically showing
at all I'm you have some the keys you

128
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:39,949
can have your books you can help of
course some email or mailing list you

129
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:44,689
know you have received general so you
also spread it and you have a center so

130
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:46,540
it's easy for people to come

131
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:52,329
and see what's going on will be
happening and join if UD like now

132
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,500
displaces you know it's basically a
space these things should be done in

133
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,780
phases we like to stay in the movement
they are commuter on sure so that

134
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:08,650
solution stop you should consider the
upkeep of the place and respect others

135
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:15,350
if you have a lovely a stinky cheese
with your friends not everybody enjoy it

136
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:21,530
so keeping an eye on how you respect
other people around it's important

137
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,930
especially with the food and drink
because some of them may be quite

138
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:28,680
aggressive and we had some explosions of
former did ring soon overlapped observer

139
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,219
destroyed and things like that and it
doesn't heed to the spirit of the

140
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:39,770
community so the food and drinks they
bind people to gather the preparation

141
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:44,430
and consumption to gather around the
table it can sort of things it's done on

142
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:49,969
a daily basis if you lie so it really
keeps the committee together and improve

143
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:57,140
the spirit but if it's done wrong way it
can also make a huge issues to report

144
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,110
that people would you like to try to
disassemble kitchen or whatever so its

145
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:06,660
board ways like you know great stuff can
be done but also it can have

146
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:13,560
consequences so this would be the basic
ourselves so kind of you know community

147
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,819
and modern means your mother her space
should survive activities its aborted

148
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:27,970
because otherwise yard drive course now
this is you know the experiment

149
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,690
primitive network because its pasta you
may know

150
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:37,450
spirited away said to cheer on a comic
movie from home is a key here is

151
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,810
basically kind of the code name you know
which I use for the project because I

152
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:46,750
like the name now what I did in the past
hour just run through it quickly so I

153
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:54,170
don't like not too slow I got involved
with taste bridge nose bridge for half

154
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,279
year basically in his wish I think great
start

155
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,660
brewing you know classes every week
preparing you know kind of food forum

156
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,969
member commission meetings every week so
to three days of activities for public

157
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:11,769
we did even like five minutes of talk
knows but it would have one evening once

158
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:17,209
per mom I think first day of the model
Tuesday whatever hundreds of people show

159
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:20,050
up for years they would keep the
tradition

160
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,449
make food and drinks for the people who
come all the nation base you don't have

161
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:28,878
money it's ok just have it you know
somebody else has an industry viacom

162
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,610
related resources for our activities
server basically kind of you know

163
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:38,660
cooking enjoying an all doing personal
stuff from the community resources also

164
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,019
kind of getting the equipment which is
also very important

165
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:50,420
repeated basically same thing in 91 laps
in go away in our lives again half-year

166
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,790
of basically no doing stuff like that

167
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,800
more for in a beer direction they
basically actually by the way they were

168
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:05,449
one of the first spaces who did all
waged it really proper brewing classes

169
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:10,109
later they got in touch you know because
of the history day or the head with us

170
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,259
they got in touch with a local brewing
shot and they were running several

171
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:19,779
months of really high-quality classes
professional classes for two people for

172
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:24,120
really minimal resources like you know
for abuse 420 euros you know it you know

173
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,899
it's very very cheap foot of a stun gun
trees and you make your beer you really

174
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:33,610
learn how to make it you taste it an
already great stop now we asked to do

175
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:39,639
predicting base it was around 2011 most
which was around 2010 11:48 p.m. base of

176
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,589
your running for on five years the
obvious that the most of this basically

177
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:49,910
any CCC major even congress scams yard
there and if you see downstairs that

178
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:55,879
small sport we have expertise in the
kitchen of our show venue bill up we are

179
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:00,199
running civil war every day of workshops
automated want to teach people how to do

180
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:01,949
what to do

181
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,160
and we promote basically trying to
spread around so people get involved in

182
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,839
the movement they improved academic
honors you know and we can start to do

183
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:15,270
more things you can see for example some
would even say not too many you can for

184
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:20,490
example he had already food included
like a modern city if you participate in

185
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:26,590
democracy d you have free access to food
as an example it's a small file for

186
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:30,410
example for bigger events it's harder
because they are from vendors and it's

187
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,270
hard to do something around it so we are
trying to promote it so we can do more

188
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:39,350
and more without problems and its kind
of friendly now and then singled out I

189
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:46,580
mentioned that sorry now quickly
experiment in awaited what should be

190
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,580
doing if you have something you know
like if you think about your electronic

191
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,860
kind of the laboratory space you try to
promote stuff right

192
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,270
you get your TV B Gone with kids you
know recalling all you teach the kids

193
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:04,569
you know how to make it public
interviews done similar things you know

194
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:10,139
terminations you built for example
really experimenting later so you play

195
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:16,339
the electronics you shared data to get
happy and all you get people involved we

196
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:21,669
want you know by the community so trying
to really get the community together

197
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:27,970
because they are sometimes social issues
like us on exactly the most social kind

198
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,880
of other people from time to time so
this kind of being together drinks of

199
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:41,830
two gether its I think very important I
like applied so I like stop being done

200
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:47,230
one thing which I to say about a woman
sometimes I feel that people like to

201
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,049
play a lot but it's more like a bad idea

202
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:58,490
the result is not considered so much in
my case I enjoy playing very much do but

203
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:04,159
I like to do something but as a
practical application so basically when

204
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,649
I'm really going out of something I want
to see it in all happen and do something

205
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:13,590
in the reward which is improving
something knowledge better Kotli

206
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:19,340
basically making the world better space
so I like to have you know the facts on

207
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:25,178
the ground and things happen again and
during the time now covering at least

208
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:31,639
part of the living costs if you want to
do Staff General you have to cover

209
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:36,990
living costs it's very important part
you can have of course you're high paid

210
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:47,120
job somewhere or you working for someone
whatever or you can do what you like and

211
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,610
cover your cost of living by doing that
I believe in that and I'm always trying

212
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,899
to promote it in a way seeing Hager
spaces lowering their membership fee so

213
00:18:56,899 --> 00:19:01,090
people can show the comment to start
even working from a cost basis

214
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:06,480
seeing her residency 0 popping up so
people can go around 40 projects a

215
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,870
low-budget acres they can come and they
can get the Coalition for really cheap

216
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:16,268
so they can stick around and do start so
this is a more thing I want to do this

217
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:19,450
and I want to cover my cost of living by
doing that

218
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,230
Logan nichols' doing to get their
careers and support a similar activities

219
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,480
of the others in this way and excellent

220
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,649
being excellent of each other there's no
British Motor which I like very much so

221
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:37,100
the excellent to each other a second of
the basic stone now

222
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,600
what should be in dimension to community
base so it's a really commuter South not

223
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,770
some private one person you know you
know and the price documentation of your

224
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,789
document how to do that's important

225
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:54,379
like the record here in all presentation
you can check it later on you know to

226
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,010
the keys etc very nice there should be
of course experiment of a new

227
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:04,129
educational needs of our shop and there
should be of course some storage

228
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:09,669
capacity whatever we will jump on that
that's part of the project residents of

229
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:14,600
possible and small-scale production I
would like to be able to make two

230
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:21,340
thousand litres of beer for the CCC
congress of football go on and have a

231
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:21,830
dare

232
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,850
so production is important that supplied
power which I like now there's a picture

233
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,340
just for you to enjoy this is more or
less a holder for the game based look

234
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,850
like the CCC can this outfit on 10 meter
10 so quite prolific will probably take

235
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,780
around half of this you know hall and we
were going non-stop cheese tasting beer

236
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,980
tastings you know you know come watch
out for shopping all you know and

237
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:53,190
commercial whatever 45 days you know ten
fifteen people in the main kind of you

238
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,870
know group people coming from all around
the campground you know enjoying with us

239
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:03,168
you know doing stuff together that's
what we do at the Cannes congress's and

240
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:07,309
there's basically I want to be building
inside to summer in Europe so this

241
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:13,520
presentation is about how I can do
something ideas inside somewhere around

242
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,370
Europe and be involved in that project
some main kind of you know process for

243
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:25,469
four to six years doing what I like and
covering costs of the project and my

244
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,679
one's here it's you know just in the
warts around 14 years experience

245
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,380
combined from the academy and second
movement fermentation so altogether kind

246
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,789
of did I want to do this basically the
other US so not alone I'm looking for

247
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:43,120
people who would be coming and doing
this sort is one of the reasons for the

248
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,379
presentation

249
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,740
I am livid sorry that the presentations
be driving a lot to do really fun

250
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,110
presentation about a fermentation stuff
like that and this is kind of project

251
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:58,120
presentation so I have to go through the
facts to a degree so bear with me we are

252
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:03,590
kind of I would say in a two-thirds
already I want to have to strongly about

253
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:09,240
focus so I want to relist make things to
promote it a-ron saudis things happening

254
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,650
more and more down more from addition
centers didn't hecker movement because I

255
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:20,080
like to stayed hidden movement so Pramod
way and see results like you know but

256
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,929
the technology of commercial production
which you can share for example usual

257
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,080
local Brewers of cum which are so they
cost

258
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,470
are decreasing they can make more profit
and you promote providing drinks and

259
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,490
food through your help

260
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:41,550
movement so now I am up-to-date belief I
need resources I need resources and its

261
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:47,379
people spread the war and I need to find
a place where can I do this if I

262
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,840
postulated this you know what I'm trying
to do in one slight let's I am trying to

263
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,060
establish a community both in the
virtual and physical award very clean

264
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:06,470
come and learn and apply your knowledge
related to the food beverages

265
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:14,580
and Iran dis think I want to make it
into the self-sustaining system so what

266
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:21,580
I come out of it during the years of war
should be covering its own costs so its

267
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,030
resources as a very important that's
actually a home one of the things I

268
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:31,129
really like about it spaces that
measured of them is supported through

269
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:37,289
the community and its independent so
very important now once this is done I

270
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:43,860
have a system doing is basically I want
to promote international international a

271
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,209
boat in the Europe third-world countries
the Iraq and Syria be happening more and

272
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:49,940
more

273
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:58,049
still as much as possible within the
moment no first face if you don't mind a

274
00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:04,490
wrong because to be absolutely honest
now I'm preparing for the first face

275
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:11,140
there will be second tort let's say four
phases you know which mention but

276
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,909
there's not so much point at the moment
to go in detail for the second third

277
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:21,179
fourth place because it will change
depending on how its planned and that's

278
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:26,150
now basically so what's happening now
now I'm to review a bit my girlfriend

279
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,260
talking to the people looking what are
the options what is the economic

280
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,150
situation what would be the best spot to
do it so far

281
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:39,049
marilyn is real high we will see about
other places but probably Berlin would

282
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:41,960
be the place where I would like to
started but not a hundred percent sure

283
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:48,900
yet I need in the first place to sit
somewhere basically four year and a half

284
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:55,059
covering expensive oil my living
expenses and prepare the project because

285
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:59,658
what i'm saying you know kind of I do
for a long time but I need to make

286
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:04,880
business proposals project proposal and
I need to get it out to the foundations

287
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,780
to the people like you know basically

288
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:14,059
supporters you know so I can get
resources it disposed moment the first

289
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:15,590
phase will be about

290
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:21,129
but I mentioned a business proposal
project proposal looking for the place

291
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:27,690
preferably I should be ordered in the
location during all this where I want to

292
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:32,390
do hope project I hopeful that but it
may be that I would be somewhere else

293
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,520
and after work to find a location we'll
see about that

294
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,158
depending what are they of course I
would like to do part of this academic

295
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,679
project so I would like to disappear

296
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,470
partly because it's Henrico senior
status if you want to get access to

297
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:55,159
knowledge around award and being able to
move freely to a degree PhD academic

298
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:59,750
status is a very Hyundai also it's for
me because I'm not the most systematic

299
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:07,620
person in the world and having basically
give out the reports on a regular basis

300
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,969
to the economy is headed for me now
there have to be some newsletters

301
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:18,370
portals things which we already have if
you go for food or you will see most of

302
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:22,260
these things or the kind of you know
starting to be established

303
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,529
vicki's VFR brought you know via our
mailing list we have to see things which

304
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:31,399
are on display something I'll be
establishing put this project as part of

305
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:37,649
the federal base about independent will
be not taking based only really kind of

306
00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:43,529
you know related because I do not want
to to clash two groups one of nonprofit

307
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:48,700
and fun and hope you will ever and one
which will have some basically money for

308
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:56,000
cause because we will need to get
resources so the independence yeah I do

309
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,549
believe in one year one year and a half
I will be done with I need repairing

310
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:07,480
physical resources for the next few
years and I would say twenty to thirty

311
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:13,470
dollars a year and a half if I do not
get any special trains like you know cut

312
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,570
down on accommodation because you are
living with some you know

313
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:21,289
residents etcetera etcetera and you can
have it can be half but it depends what

314
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:27,230
I can find but I can imagine in the
western Iran 1200 1500 euro if you want

315
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,909
to be able to go but around four

316
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:33,509
congresses conferences and to stop that
small as the minimum you know lower than

317
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:39,369
in Germany for example you will run into
troubles this is just things which are

318
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:45,609
already basically mentioned them so I
think we can quickly go over it going

319
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:52,049
around for the conference's you sit on
one place for quite a while to make it

320
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:58,389
and waste of sourcing I should mention
that I like divers of resources so it

321
00:27:58,389 --> 00:28:03,590
should be basically some money from my
personal kind of you know funds which

322
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:09,109
are low but some community supports or
something so serious that definitely

323
00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:16,029
some republicans so I will be looking
for some people who I respect and they

324
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:21,340
are respected concerning their ways how
they good for somebody resources like I

325
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,320
don't want to have for the bond money
from their power some you know army

326
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,139
based in our group our rhetoric
resources and I will combine this now

327
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:36,918
this is the second phase basically this
is the moment when I have the location

328
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:42,049
where I want to make this if you imagine
this fall in a hole I think it's a big

329
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:47,389
too big about something like if I can
get this and make their experiment the

330
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:54,408
kind of creature that's a brewing place
virtual venue and of course production

331
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:58,919
that will be perfect and this is where
this will be the time but I'll be doing

332
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:05,369
that within one year I want to build it
and start to make it happen I have done

333
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:09,399
is basically a different levels for four
times already so that's basically what

334
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:14,820
I'm doing for the last six seven years
in different places so it's possible one

335
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,759
year it's short but verbal unit money of
course you know for the build-up for

336
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:26,580
your running costs and for your own
personal expenses I will need to get in

337
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,759
this time of course have all the
resources for the next few years because

338
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:36,210
this project will take minimum five to
six years I expect for 26 years you know

339
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:42,019
there's will take to make it happen so
days here people built and make the

340
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:47,849
place or the efficient so you can rank
start you can start to your do your

341
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:52,399
workshops you can start to run
experiments decisive for example kind of

342
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,879
developing new ways of cum blowjob USO
beer brewing spreading around so

343
00:29:56,879 --> 00:30:00,978
building and starting to use it because
if you don't start to use it you will

344
00:30:00,979 --> 00:30:06,080
not know if it functions are not so you
have to start to use the spot get a

345
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,918
community get a people in a few more
shots every week

346
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,440
adultery for workshops you know
promotion going for the congresses and

347
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:20,080
make it happen this will be very busy
period this is basically a result of

348
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,240
what I expect

349
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,250
at the end of the second phase that
let's say six year second and a half

350
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:32,510
year to be done its operating in a water
is running a dresser running everything

351
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:37,490
what you need to know storage capacities
there you use it you are running

352
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:43,340
experiments show experiments and you do
to our workshops production facility

353
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,070
completed that's a big one

354
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:50,590
it maybe not possible for the ones who
are into the food or drink production

355
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:56,139
facility may be separated or I may have
to cooperate with someone because making

356
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:02,070
legally food or drinks in you it's
difficult and it may be a killer for the

357
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:07,629
project so I'm may have to wait for
design a bit or cooperate with someone

358
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:12,270
so it together about if I could have
done that in this time to be perfectly

359
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:17,090
beautiful economic report I'll have to
hand it in so I see however moving

360
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:22,500
forward because otherwise I don't myself
and I would like to see if we can assume

361
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,740
hecker residency option this is special
reason for the fermentation people if

362
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:33,570
you do fermentations unique time I
cannot make you be in one day or

363
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:39,110
companies are you know why you need days
or weeks or months so if somebody

364
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:43,300
supposed to come for a project for
example see ok I want to receive no in

365
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:48,639
Central America I know I have a place I
need a knowledge then basically you know

366
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:56,650
I want to make a few drinks and food can
you show me yeah I can i three months or

367
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:00,870
unique three months you know to be there
on the reader in a proper way so I know

368
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:05,530
you come back and you can do it so you
need more time and I think some of it

369
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,550
you know actually hate group projects 20
you don't do think you know they're in

370
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:14,450
24 hours you can but you need to learn
you need to apply so you usually at

371
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:18,520
least weeks or months so hecker as an
insult to be great but again it's not

372
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,210
the core it'll be very handy but

373
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:26,600
yeah we will see I will have to cover of
course the unit budget from different

374
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:33,029
sources that would be interesting to
hear again this is basically results you

375
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:40,710
know thirty 30 days so first face
preparation and project you know kind of

376
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,270
development second face make it happen

377
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:48,260
physically building it into place and
running that starting to run it the

378
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:53,190
third phases basically the running to
three years of war shops of order so

379
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:58,299
that you can imagine around fermentation
going on and on on a daily basis so

380
00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:02,600
you're too realistic Quran and this is
the time when actually you finally can

381
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,289
do what you want it you know this is the
part you know very you really hard

382
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:10,710
because before it's been good build-up
preparation build up to 23 years may

383
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:15,570
take and this is basically two to three
years when you are doing the things and

384
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:19,539
showing ok these wars did you know what
to do next

385
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:23,640
you will be of course running around
Europe for the bigger even so you know

386
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,980
trying to you know did the food in all
today even like this for example in also

387
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,809
there's a free kind of food for example
for even from different resources you

388
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:37,260
know you know things like that of course
you know you will be all what I

389
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,669
mentioning here

390
00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:44,830
international cooperation you are trying
to collaborate because people need to

391
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:50,330
see and also you basically important you
need to see kind of you know ok I'm

392
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,870
doing this they are starting to the
similar thing what works what doesn't

393
00:33:53,870 --> 00:34:00,439
ideas spaces many ideas coming over but
you don't expect that something what is

394
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:06,220
very important I want to have a day off
course if possible take residents to set

395
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:12,720
up and of course continue with the
Academy reports general budget this is

396
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,348
this is basically guess like you know
you take a bigger space in western

397
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:24,169
europe 2250 members let's say you will
be running around 800 to 1,200 euros per

398
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:30,408
month there's a basic issue at least one
person living expenses

399
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:34,460
you know you have your basic you know
$15,000 to $50,000

400
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:39,980
alter day so it's kind of you know we
will see if I get someone for example

401
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:44,480
and our precious somebody can say okay
you can have display for five years

402
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,409
do whatever you like no rain just cover
electricity and water while you know

403
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:57,099
like it's half but it depends so this
was a third phase of our I do staff and

404
00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:02,530
this is the final face this is basically
when I'm closing up so you can see

405
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:10,240
orders basically closest 60625 27 years
you have a mortal you establish model of

406
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,560
where you are doing things we are
getting money from the membership fees

407
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,359
campaigns some production some
international even though you have stuff

408
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,960
and you cannot get a few thousand euros
up from the even you bring in a you cape

409
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,740
your basic budget stable so you know
that you can get that of course there's

410
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:35,779
a variety of funding so it will have to
be flexible like Iran hedges basis so

411
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:40,859
you have sustained a project which has
46,000 year later I can get something

412
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:45,549
like that that's really demolish are
going through I think what used to be

413
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:50,250
honest maybe 20 see you have to have
because we are finishing up their

414
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:55,000
budgets covered so whatever you're doing
you should now find out that you are not

415
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,339
you know you know fifty thousand euros
in my nose but you are basically

416
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:04,880
reaching the level that ok the project
is kind of you know cover and its can go

417
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,750
forward and her future goals said
because he only moving all of 24 26

418
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:16,119
years is a long time you know I would be
around 14 that time so it's time to kind

419
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:21,380
of move on and the future goals of
course should be set this is a small

420
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:26,660
timeline first second third and fourth
phase basically you can see if you just

421
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:32,480
quickly check it out you know one and
one-half years basic preparation one

422
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,800
year make it happen so it actually
exists two to three years running that

423
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,290
and another 12 years together having
your PTZ is done having it you know

424
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,930
online read it properly documented all
comes together

425
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:52,950
the budget maybe 250,000 euros for six
years I can imagine it can be a little

426
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:56,529
more but it will be not hundreds I'm
quite sure about that so it's kind of

427
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:02,770
you know did it will cost and I will
have to find the resources for that

428
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:09,369
video of whoever can so six years two
dozen 16 2021 so next year basically

429
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:15,520
starting or you're already working on
that now the budget is here and of

430
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,869
course the total benefit of the project
is priceless

431
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:24,119
because it's something I want to do I
have been doing this for a long time in

432
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:29,280
a systematic way now like to offer on
the war but now I want to find a spot

433
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,410
the base you can see through the
freaking basis we did together with

434
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:37,618
other people that it's actually
functions to a degree but it has to be

435
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:44,059
improved especially the part which I
need is to get more resources for also

436
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:47,400
lower expenses because as long as you do
not sort this out

437
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,450
don't cover this then you have to do
something else and you are going to

438
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:57,439
waste your time is so doing it to what
you want you to print something else to

439
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:04,309
get the money now this is the last light
I hope you'll have some time for the

440
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:05,700
discussion

441
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,078
still because I was but that really kind
of put middle so sorry for the less

442
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:19,329
energy this context which you can see
later on also you know internet etc I

443
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:23,400
would like to thank to freaking base
group and our project because that's

444
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,240
basically what make my life very happy
in the last several years and also made

445
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,359
it possible to come here and I would
like to also think to him as which is

446
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:39,078
actually a foundation my friend is
working there and he got me to europe

447
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:43,440
and begged my girlfriend covering the
flight tickets because otherwise I may

448
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,730
not be here so I would like to think to
them and everyone who comes interest for

449
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,710
the Cubase

450
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:59,330
I hope to see you at the CCC camps
congress's hope for the 2016 so for

451
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:04,380
whatever forty I think here thank you
thank you for coming and open discussion

452
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,830
for talking about the ideas and the
project ok

453
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:20,790
number one who is the number one has to
be number one

454
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:33,210
how much time do we have five minutes
beautiful number one question

455
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:42,910
I believe you're listening at is one
question to nobody interests

456
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:53,440
fermentation food and drinks ok yes
there's a microphone so everybody hears

457
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:00,230
it's more like a brain fart maybe but
how far do you also want to combine your

458
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:05,860
projects we had some other projects that
may not be so much into fermentation but

459
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:11,550
feeling more ecological kind of projects
because I know to nearby there is

460
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:16,220
actually a place called scripts ecology
in there but for about a year or so

461
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:21,259
there should be a logical center there
are also very much into self sustaining

462
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:27,090
ideas just not to show much into food as
far as I know could be an option to

463
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:31,220
combine your project for instance would
what they are doing there i mean that

464
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:36,560
you could supplied in which they or do
you have any ambitions in that direction

465
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:45,790
where is this place with Carla see it's
about 20 kilometres south from here

466
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:53,529
consenting miss you know basically my
main I want to stay awesome a movement

467
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:58,000
within the movement but I was always
trying too busy to bring the slow food

468
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,790
let's say the sustainable development
that type of people which is very hard

469
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:08,190
sometimes especially the slow food but I
do have a mission in this direction

470
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:13,810
because I don't think all of the
resources should come from the movement

471
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:19,410
and actually logically you know this
project will be a lot like I will be be

472
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,330
somewhere and I talked a lot about
international cooperation but I'll be

473
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,410
educating people who many of them you
know they don't have a clue about

474
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,170
helping move on so kind of but they
would like to make their beer and things

475
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:34,200
like that so you know making also
products because of football operations

476
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:41,520
Ray important for the local community
maybe some higher value stop so big part

477
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,240
of this should be fine you know

478
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,839
through some resources which are not
directly from the second movement you

479
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,750
know because it would be doing boat
it'll be fun but the local kind of feel

480
00:41:55,750 --> 00:42:01,100
appliance ecological centrist are one of
the possibilities so excited I have

481
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:06,650
serious air on but I need to get in
touch with ya place basically and this

482
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,810
is what I need to do within the year
year and a half of preparation see what

483
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:16,460
I can get you know she basically how I
can cooperate but still definitely I

484
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,190
want to keep some independence because I
had been experienced in corrupt

485
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:27,880
activities and I need to see the core
kind of you know not too many strings

486
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,460
attached thats like the Tigers basis but
this is something I hope to cooperate

487
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,030
and get some

488
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:42,750
establish institutions next question
maybe one more because the time is

489
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:49,030
running more questions of course you can
come downstairs microphone the kimbap

490
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:56,480
maybe still there maybe not depends I
hope it is and drinks provided rings are

491
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,869
so we didn't try and you didn't read my
comp enjoy it I will be giving you a job

492
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:09,570
which was made for the CCC can explode
your have not okay thank you very much
