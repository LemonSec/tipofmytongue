1
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,150
thank you all for coming first and
welcome to the third day of the balkan

2
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,340
congress topical this presentation is
going to be about proud communication

3
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,050
with mobile phones to the past no way
around the open-source way so please

4
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:46,849
read the lecture and let's start saying
so many Sharkey everybody not many

5
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:55,140
people know me here so I think I should
introduce myself a little bit I got my

6
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,220
first BC way back down in ninety one and
it turned out it couldn't run anything

7
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,650
by the US so that was a bummer it as I
was a kid and always want to just play

8
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,850
games I was coming from the media and ok
that turned out pretty well because

9
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:16,759
later on I didn't have problems
switching to Linux because when I surged

10
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,720
switch to Linux most stuff you had to do
was in the console you have to take your

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,390
commands after site on some time I got
my bro them two hundred and forty

12
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:38,100
hundred boat motor boat means 300 bytes
per second the police

13
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:46,860
speed way better than from a modem
during my local BB asses explorations I

14
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:54,039
found out reference to the mailing list
call deciphered banks banks are all

15
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,400
dolled mailing list comprised mainly off

16
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:08,259
photographers Packers libertarians
people who believe in privacy and

17
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:14,540
security and they think that think made
such an impression to me I was just a

18
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:24,209
kid then I was exposed to something like
the clipper chip was attempt in the

19
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:32,380
nineties by the NSA to install chips in
mobile forms to be able to intercept

20
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,010
traffic they said ok we'll give you a
strong crypto but we'll keep the keys

21
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:45,130
for ourselves and providers didn't like
that and that problem but must AT&T room

22
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:53,720
6 40 days that was first public
disclosure of government recording

23
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:06,120
emails web browsing history all things
that was done to fight the terrorists

24
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:16,790
but that those things those aren't used
to check the terrorists at all just 40

25
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:26,350
miles because economic commercial
services and South republics this was a

26
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:33,030
quote from 1993 and it's still as valid
today you really cannot allow

27
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:40,900
corporations and government to allow
them to think of your privacy because as

28
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,530
you turned out most of the camper
corporations are Facebook Google

29
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:54,400
Microsoft they all give free services in
return for some kind of data from you

30
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,239
and if you want to defended you cannot
leave do anything to anyone but you and

31
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,910
central banks were

32
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:09,950
Packers they were able to write code and
peace

33
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:22,190
great great example that was one of the
first programs that was released as as a

34
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,910
response to the Echelon program which
was capturing all the email and in the

35
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:34,230
nineties this is what with this is what
I remember it in the nineties strong

36
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:41,420
encryption was considered ammunition
like a weapon and people weren't allowed

37
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:48,150
to export it but books were allowed to
export so filament the greater role BGP

38
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,849
actually wrote the book put all its
source code in a book and said ok you

39
00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:01,720
can bite like that you can scan it like
OCR and compiler pgp without expert with

40
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:09,580
restrictions after seven years of
lawsuits by eff by Electronic Frontier

41
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:20,409
Foundation privacy advocates in the year
2000 they actually managed to abolish

42
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:33,730
that munitions that classification and
political support national ID was the

43
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:42,320
system that was receiving satellite
links in in the nineties goes to the

44
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,430
internet was going over the satellite
over the oceans so they set up listening

45
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:57,260
posts and was thinking like that's maybe
like I don't know they're doing that

46
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,000
some like kind of conspiracy theories I
wasn't sure about it

47
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,950
everybody everybody everybody was
talking about the nineties and I wasn't

48
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:12,820
sure and twenty years later there comes
a guy which dumps these files in these

49
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:21,020
are files from the snow that cash which
actually show that not only they were

50
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:27,070
right about this forum said this is
actually well plus forty satellite

51
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:35,360
listening stations worldwide but much
more large cable interceptions but the

52
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,090
major all those cables that run through
the oceans they have to come out at the

53
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:52,580
station right so the government with
their secret agreements forced or asked

54
00:06:52,580 --> 00:07:00,599
large providers to let them run their
equipment there be any this is credible

55
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,240
and this is all better

56
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,780
this is from Lady 2012 series computer
network exploitation 50,000 implants

57
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:18,960
they have by the time fifty thousand
Internet routers from Cisco from all the

58
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:28,020
way from all the major producers of
interrelate ISP service grade equipment

59
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,500
they have found

60
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:37,180
doors exploits and they're affecting
those routers with their software fifty

61
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,620
thousand of those that was like struck
me the most

62
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,410
so they control every one of those
routers anywhere in the world where they

63
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:51,360
can reroute traffic disabled interested
filter eight block certain sides

64
00:07:51,360 --> 00:08:01,650
intercept communications inject stuff in
communications just because of that and

65
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:10,840
this one third party or liaison 30
countries countries that are operating

66
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:21,409
with and when you go to this list you
can see that you have here but the best

67
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:32,020
I could reach 1000 laboring countries
for people who are not from here and the

68
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:40,010
rest of these black dots they are
blanked by the published this maybe

69
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,140
Guardian Guardian was one of the
company's one of news outlets that was

70
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:55,520
reporting on still in files until they
real exact language greenwald day here

71
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:02,579
they actually consulted with
representatives of the NSE or the UK's

72
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,930
version GCHQ

73
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:09,949
ok is it ok that we publish this and
they said okay but you have to black

74
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:16,850
those sites so more than half of sites
are blocked so you don't know if there's

75
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:24,130
one in Bell great let's say really the
end that is third party liaison that's

76
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:31,160
on the country level that's not what we
say computer networks acini they're not

77
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,889
just affecting some reuter and then they
get ability to

78
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:40,660
change something in a in a in a traffic
this liaison think means that they have

79
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:47,108
their datacenter their computers their
switches there there's players and

80
00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:52,499
they're listening equipment installed in
those countries all around the world

81
00:09:52,499 --> 00:10:00,129
known so it's not just like ok this
spying on Americans there USA does he

82
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:06,259
know they're talking about the entire
world so any time you use from belgrade

83
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:11,579
from whatever from serbia from whatever
the internet you have to cross some of

84
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:18,169
these points so it's not like okay it
doesn't mind me I'm not gonna get to

85
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:31,809
those in their in their crosshairs right
several points members at least came to

86
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:39,339
do to get involving such project which
we which is still used today mostly CC'd

87
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:47,750
its impressive list

88
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:58,390
during that mailing list I was I was
only trying I was only a kid back then I

89
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:06,840
didn't understand the importance of all
this but I was growing up with the

90
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:13,000
notion that something is being done to
the great free internet that we use that

91
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:22,010
we were using in the nineties in the
beginning of the dozens and people baby

92
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:28,430
don't know how things came to be and I'm
saying these things are going from the

93
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:35,939
nineties really not something you this
is not something that's no then this is

94
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:42,620
not which happened something after snow
the release those documents through

95
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:49,590
cheyenne is critical for security expert
and she has a mailing list call

96
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:57,480
cryptogram which I was following for the
number your number of years and when you

97
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,480
follow that list for a long long time
you get to see the better every year

98
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,360
there's another attack

99
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:12,980
there's another removal of privacy
another Liberty reproducing liberties

100
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,589
what you can do what is not being
tracked and this is the great example

101
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:28,450
this post is from 2006 every mobile
phone company in the world has to

102
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:36,040
enable wiretapping of their devices at
their client's at the behest of police

103
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:42,689
or law enforcement or the emergencies
that operate in that country so the

104
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:48,870
central buildings the whole switches are
already wreaked with surveillance

105
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:54,200
software that's not just like something
you go and collect you know the two

106
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:01,270
wires and listen though it's built into
the phone switches as a function and see

107
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:08,689
somebody it's it wasn't find out
somebody managed to detain this is Eric

108
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:16,750
sons service someone managed to hack
into Ericsson's server to disable the

109
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:24,270
palette of all the things to disable the
notifications adaalat or through the

110
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:31,610
toilet and to wiretap 100 greek
ministers prime minister called cabinet

111
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:38,720
what a lot of people and to send those
calls to some undisclosed repeat numbers

112
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,680
using the conference call function of
those same services and that's the

113
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:51,380
problem when you start building in
wiretap functionality in syracuse and

114
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,510
switches in what I were somebody's going
to find out about that you cannot always

115
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:01,790
be sure okay but only we are going to
use wiretapping capability this is the

116
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,819
prime example this is a great example
somebody's going to hack into it

117
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,540
somebody is going to find out how to use
it and to use it for no legal purposes

118
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:17,180
I'm not saying I understand that law
enforcement has legitimate needs to

119
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:24,209
follow criminals groups but that also
have to be technically protected in with

120
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:30,060
illegal flavor framework this is this is
the problem which shows that when you

121
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,500
start putting now the FBI in the
nineties is also now

122
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,660
FBI's always calling we are going dark
we cannot see people using encryption

123
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:50,839
we're not going to be able to find child
abductors and whatever and they argue

124
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,970
against the corruption all these
programs that are talking to be about

125
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:05,920
encryption privacy this is a great
picture this summons the entire

126
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,490
cryptography we always think ok just
used wrong crypto and you're free to go

127
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:19,710
you can do whatever you want nobody is
going to be able to procure coats in

128
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:29,800
reality that can happen that really sums
it up somebody can infect your computer

129
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:36,089
with a Trojan virus infect your phone
with the Trojans who for the whole

130
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:45,370
summer day was use about hacking team
company which got hacked and got their

131
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:54,010
four hundred gigabyte of information
released that was that is software which

132
00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:02,660
countries by mostly country's national
state security agencies by to infect the

133
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:09,709
targets force that is a software which
no antivirus can find and that is a

134
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:16,180
software which cares capabilities to
record audio record needs some

135
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:24,489
screenshots record browsing history
access all the files there is even

136
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:32,800
there's even a function in hacking
software called child porn function and

137
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,569
when it occurs because there there is a
source code for it when hackers

138
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:46,310
opened it it says you can implant a file
on a suspect's computer so if you cannot

139
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:53,959
arrest him without maybe he's doing
really nothing serious really nothing

140
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:00,510
wrong really nothing you can push a
button and child porn file child porn .

141
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:08,260
file on his role on his laptop his
brother and when she goes to the next

142
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,770
time

143
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:14,420
customs inspection whatever when people
find jobs board that I V his file your

144
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:20,280
directly going to jail because in
america that is punishable just by

145
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:29,940
looking at it so you really don't have
to be involved in making it producing it

146
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,730
whatever just the fact that you're
watching it is punishable by serious

147
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:41,790
serious crimes so this is the problem
this is the major problem we can think

148
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:48,920
ok we're doing everything rate but
something like this happen so it's not

149
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,950
for the people who are doing that stuff
we're not for who are not under the

150
00:17:53,950 --> 00:18:02,290
investigations already if you're under
investigation is already the scripted

151
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:07,940
programs are probably not going to save
you much authorities know something if

152
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,580
they are targeted if your targeted they
can always a factor for ancillary

153
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:23,649
equipment is this is this is really
really tough privacy privacy is

154
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,590
something that is very important for me
there is

155
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:37,189
huge amount of YouTube videos where you
can see somebody is singing dancing with

156
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:42,299
you doing whatever in their privacy and
they think nobody's watching them

157
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:45,760
they're like saying they don't know how
to say but I like to see you know it

158
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,750
sounds horrible and they are seen as
somebody walks into the room in there

159
00:18:50,750 --> 00:19:02,230
like 1030 their shame is too great to to
show that is why I say this is something

160
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:07,179
I'm willing to do only someone with no
one else is watching that is one of the

161
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:15,210
definitions of privacy and does that the
whole reason I getting this doc the

162
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,659
whole reason I giving the stock is the
reason is that when we are at the stage

163
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:23,809
where we can be monitored when we can be
watched our behavior changes

164
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:30,960
dramatically that is my problem with all
those issues and I say and it's not just

165
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,380
a let's say we just have slides from the
NSA the russians are doing that the same

166
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,250
Chinese of doing that the same all state
agencies are doing the same idea what

167
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:47,399
our state agency doing the same I will
have any leaders from serbia so we

168
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:54,090
really cannot know this stuff this stuff
is inherently secret you know so well

169
00:19:54,090 --> 00:20:01,230
what would you think every single
psychological analysis will tell you

170
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:07,760
that when people are being watched their
behavior changes this is what I get it

171
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,309
right there talk when you know that
you're being watched and you're being

172
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:18,639
watched the Google Facebook on the email
all the emails until recently were just

173
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,950
level of security of the emails and
unless encrypted by PDP or something is

174
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,120
just like a postcard just like a
postcard anyone who's sitting on the

175
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,879
network between your server and the
recipients of those of the wire without

176
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,430
any problems in this state agencies are
sitting on the backbone of the internet

177
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:43,650
this is not something like we are
getting here we are saving local traffic

178
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:51,630
know their check traffic for all
countries for whole countries and I see

179
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:56,260
United States their partners and they
have a lot of partners in this they are

180
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:02,970
using this great tool we call the
Internet to use them to indiscriminate

181
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:10,240
mass surveillance and there's a problem
because you can have one kind of

182
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:17,310
targeting the citizens the targets
erased the kidnappers the whatever the

183
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:23,919
groups and target them just them and
their contact and another thing is to

184
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,170
target the whole country's the whole
planet actually hope you remember the

185
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:35,660
previous slide and there's no lens said
these programs have never about

186
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:42,810
terrorism all the officials every single
officials especially since 2010 13 /

187
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:47,429
September 11 attacks every single
government official said we need to

188
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,790
catch their ease we cannot find
terrorists we need to have more power

189
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,659
you need to have more programs we need
to have more specific color and it was

190
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:01,290
never bother it was about economics
buying because they get by officials of

191
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:09,260
the company's the United States
companies have negotiations and

192
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:16,999
diplomatic or the Embassy's world
ministries but nowhere

193
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:26,589
people say okay well I'm not important I
have nothing to cry that is really

194
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:30,208
troubling the first thing I can say
today

195
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:36,999
ok I have this special email address and
I'll give it to you and you can send and

196
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:42,359
I'm not using it for anything else just
for you to send me password for your

197
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:50,569
facebook for your Gmail your SkyDrive
for your whatever service you use Inc

198
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:56,369
let me just different look what you're
doing I'm not a government agent I'm not

199
00:22:56,369 --> 00:23:02,379
in a court I'm not going to put you in a
jail I'm going to do anything to you

200
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:08,599
know the people who wants to give up
their passports why because they value

201
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:17,819
their privacy but they say a thing like
cancelled each other in what they can

202
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:25,959
actually say they make themselves so one
threatening so uninteresting to do to

203
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:31,169
the people that may be monitoring self
that I don't have fear from whatever it

204
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:42,049
is doing bigger terrorists sometimes was
very strict definition now you have with

205
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:48,299
each passing year you have wider and
wider interpretations of when somebody a

206
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:49,499
terrorist

207
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:58,349
it's not just like blowing buildings
blowing plains whatever they can now get

208
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:05,009
all sorts of definitions given
definitions secret definitions that they

209
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:06,130
can

210
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:18,760
prosecute somebody take somebody to jail
whatever Mark Zuckerberg they're all

211
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,940
over Facebook like he he's he's not
allowing anybody to talk about privacy

212
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:33,200
but two or three years ago he bought a
house for himself in San Francisco

213
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,910
whatever and not only he bought his
house but he bought four houses around

214
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:47,410
that babes a total of thirty million
dollars because he doesn't like for

215
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:52,780
people to watch what he's doing and he's
asking for all of you do take your

216
00:24:52,780 --> 00:25:03,080
friends to broadcast your information
all the time to be able to to massively

217
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:09,770
massively late mine all your lights all
your friends or your comments or links

218
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:18,840
everything you posed to be able to sell
that as a advertising profile just for

219
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,790
that just the data just advertising
profile but they're collecting enormous

220
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:33,820
amounts of data about everybody even the
UN Special Rapporteur said the

221
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,419
encryption is great and it should be
protected and it should be used

222
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:46,440
I'd like some euros government officials
we're just saying like that all we can

223
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,580
do that

224
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:54,449
british Prime Minister David Cameron as
soon as he's went into power this year

225
00:25:54,450 --> 00:26:01,030
he's always been saying in the news we
can't have option in UK that we can't

226
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:08,420
see so he wants to ban all these strong
encryption that government cannot break

227
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,300
there are breaking just bypassing
exception

228
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:25,399
this is the program in the beginning of
the 2008 2008 2008 lasted by the way I

229
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,810
mean maybe 2003

230
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:34,080
actually called it like that and they
wanted to centralize excess of all the

231
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:44,040
databases from the police FBI CIA sa BNP
health databases I mean I cannot

232
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:51,250
remember whatever they wanted to create
all of that in 2003 we were like great

233
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:58,210
where we were like ecstatic they
actually killed that law

234
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:07,000
killed that program like that actually
excellent you know just to be not just

235
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:14,190
to be confirmed out by clothing styles
that they just renamed as programs and

236
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,390
never ever told public about them
they're just continuing that same

237
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:29,460
program this is the logo for the wealthy
guy watching the whole planet they just

238
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,330
remain renamed it first from the Total
Information Awareness to terrorists

239
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:40,389
Information Awareness Day later related
work whatever they want

240
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:46,200
now every police station in the United
States has but they called fusion

241
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,530
centers like whatever whatever
somebody's stopped and

242
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:59,510
traffic stop gone through the red
whatever barry police problems they are

243
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:05,190
all feeling that into their fusion
database and that goes basis like this

244
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:13,310
so this is for the USS but you see the
whole planet they don't care if you're

245
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:21,899
here or yes you're a target for them
these are somebody some of the links

246
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:32,330
that using to find software which is
trustworthy which is thought to have no

247
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:41,129
big doors which has good crypto and by
good good crypto I mean first you can

248
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:48,250
verify the keys so you cannot be food
that you're talking about somebody with

249
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:57,980
somebody else I'll show you in the in
the in the examples you have to be open

250
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:06,240
source because we had so many from
smoldering fires we had so many examples

251
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,520
of companies supporting their encryption
programs RSA which is like the main

252
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:19,070
company which makes the biggest RSA
encryption you know it's like the main

253
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:27,980
encryption to drive the whole world they
had been supporting their program at the

254
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:33,350
behest of an essay so you really cannot
trust the Microsoft has been doing from

255
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:44,580
the nineties stuff they actually had
been doesn t which was for Windows 2000

256
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:51,360
they actually had filed under the
registry key that was called NSA and

257
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,139
then they they later removed when
somebody some security researchers found

258
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:00,730
where you feel like and crypto crypto
key in the registry key they have the

259
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,430
reference to the group to keep it cold
anything

260
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:08,150
when people ask their butts butts about
it you look at the worry about it at all

261
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:16,720
just flash it with a new service pack
and they respect that think I'm not a

262
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,160
disappeared maybe just applied to
another place where you can find it yet

263
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:28,460
Electronic Frontier Foundation they've
been around for the nineties

264
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:34,180
one of the founding members but was from
central banks right and they are

265
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:40,370
committed to enabling to protecting
people's privacy

266
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:46,959
deja numerous lawsuits against they have
done numerous lawsuits against you as

267
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,280
government on the behalf people that
have been targeted unjustly or whatever

268
00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:04,720
so when you throw with this you can see
these bullets into groups in transit

269
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,860
almost everything encrypt in transit but
that's not enough

270
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:13,530
encrypted so the prior can't keep can
read it where they keep private keys

271
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:19,670
that's very important to you verify the
contact identities it's also important

272
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:23,120
those whom you're not being spooked by
somebody else who's managed to crack

273
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,649
somebody's password perfect forward
secrecy our past communications secure

274
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,929
if your kids are now if somebody

275
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:39,360
steals your phone laptop whatever he has
your keys in a key cannot decrypt

276
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,428
previous communication that he may be
recorded is it open source did you

277
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:50,820
review likely is it properly documented
that is somebody that is something

278
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,590
that's also important

279
00:31:53,590 --> 00:32:00,990
has there been any recent cold or it
like has somebody from the community has

280
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:09,450
some professional code reviewers have
they looking from security security

281
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:15,730
problems in the problem and when you
start scrolling that look for a secure

282
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:24,330
everything you have that for that's for
Android and flyers all the Greens trip

283
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:30,908
to care to resolve the browser looks
like Jack Tretton

284
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:45,980
FaceTime Apple's which we say it's great
great we'll hang out they changed this

285
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:52,690
year they officially turned off and
turned the corruption so until this year

286
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:59,899
you can you you could use XMPP jet audio
chat with Google's accounts and now they

287
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:05,428
are disabled evader moving to another
two other infrastructure and that is not

288
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:13,180
secure by these standards know what I
message also

289
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:26,790
ditsy is open source chat and voice of
the Red Cross messaging engine for

290
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:36,670
winters signal red for we're doing today

291
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:43,220
silent fall is essentially the same as
the red fall silent phone is a

292
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:50,690
commercial offering from the creator of
pgp he was so fed with his relations

293
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:55,320
with these everything is so he managed
to find his own bodies and they created

294
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:01,490
silent circle company which is
commercial companies pay for them for

295
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:06,720
their service fees but they're making
the black phone

296
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:14,110
encrypted file which you can control
pretty much everything on it and the

297
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:18,400
silent fall in the Sun texts are they to
services which you can download on your

298
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:25,290
phone Android full rate paid nearly died

299
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:28,570
simpson was vio what is today

300
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:34,430
salad text also there look at the sky
link sky just great

301
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:39,969
well think again

302
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:47,899
telegram I haven't seen that I haven't
tried that still but will be put back

303
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:53,230
secure which is also a prospectus
library

304
00:34:53,230 --> 00:35:02,810
driver well people serbia's Biber what
also I think that that will be maybe

305
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:08,910
something that will be changed for viber
for what up sorry for what they have

306
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:15,609
been using Boxee Marling spikes
encryption like that secure like OTR but

307
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:20,960
the question remains I know it's going
to be open sources of going to be open

308
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:28,410
sores and what happens with the keys I
don't know if they're using the private

309
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:37,629
keys what happens with private keys of
course was never heard of anything

310
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:49,820
questions over how a continuity so it's
a lot of resources propriety there was

311
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,580
also the they were

312
00:35:52,580 --> 00:36:01,450
last night presentation freedom press
from people that were in their main

313
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:07,810
technologies was involved in the first
helping us know that leaked first cache

314
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:17,160
files of priests make a first sight for
distributing files self the self-serve

315
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:24,129
regular as is the self-serve whalers
defense that's great tight shaved I'm

316
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:30,590
look at it for every kind of device that
you know it has open source software is

317
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:36,970
with which which which can help with
your privacy worry browsing carrying

318
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:43,990
voice call creeping files a greeting
card rise PDP for email they have

319
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:50,390
detailed descriptions and editorials how
can use it that's great site they

320
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:57,120
recently upgraded it to something a
little more water

321
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:11,580
the first program will be talking about
this model so as you can see it's a

322
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,509
group to chat

323
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:19,640
it's a different voice voice chat it's
something that was actually made for

324
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:27,900
gaming users like 300 for games bring
you can have many people on one channel

325
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:35,070
in there but they know they don't need
to check this is interesting program

326
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:41,790
it's not this is the least secure of all
those programs are going to show you

327
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:46,020
today but it's still a yes

328
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:58,620
254 255 6 bit AES encrypted so that is
something that hasn't been back today in

329
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:06,920
any kind of way this can be useful for
when you're having a meeting I drove in

330
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,850
your company or your friends and you
don't want to text of the message

331
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:17,830
exchanges go to any server you want to
create channel and moisture for

332
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:31,009
everybody everybody can speak at the
same time so one thing this program of

333
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:37,390
all doesn't have what we call at twenty
corruption so from my device to device

334
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:41,359
it's not equipped is encrypted from your
device to the server so that's a problem

335
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:48,100
what if you have to you but if you use a
compromise terror what somebody has got

336
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:54,819
you so well I say that really is isn't
the case because you can host your

337
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,900
server at all with these things

338
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:04,350
raspberry PI's these things are really
cheap these draw like 3 watts of

339
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,069
electricity running all day

340
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:11,920
lil Linux server and you can just
install mobile service that's called

341
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,660
rumor you can install your own server

342
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:21,078
this certain that nobody's abusing your
keys nobody's abusing your encryption it

343
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:24,980
any way you can install it in your hole
like I did

344
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:33,170
UK stolid company or whatever you like
or you can use some of the thousands of

345
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:40,480
free servers out in the Internet leader
logos people that organize these are

346
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,880
also hosting their their server who goes
by MoDOT lewis dot org

347
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,640
show you later so when you start the
program you have a list of favorite

348
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:59,750
sellers I register my testicle out or
mobile that locals you don't have to

349
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:07,520
resist account you just type in your
username so there's no passwords to

350
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:13,819
remember there's no anything just
whatever what everyone to be called all

351
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:19,660
description is being done by the
certificates certificates and later the

352
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:26,910
stream is being equipped with a yes this
is what looks like to be taken which

353
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:31,848
channels for whatever this trough or
whatever topic that you like and I

354
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:40,599
joined my two devices at the bottom of
the screen

355
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:44,369
push-to-talk when you push it you're
talking just like that

356
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:52,569
walkie-talkie devices are used like it
you know or you can set it to be voice

357
00:40:52,569 --> 00:40:58,400
activated when you start talking it out
with just hates you can also use it for

358
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:06,230
jackets if you don't want to speak out
by which you can send all messages

359
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:13,150
through to the true let same channel to
channel that you can choose

360
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:22,770
when you go to the information you see
decrypted with 256 bit AES so it's great

361
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:31,799
in terms of encryption voice channel 128
bit AES like and this is the limited

362
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:39,309
bandwidth sent to a lab it's the kodak
is open so it's really like each the

363
00:41:39,309 --> 00:41:44,430
sound like when you put the cap set your
phone

364
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:49,368
the sound is perfect results provide
there's no crackling there's no noise

365
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:50,369
there is no nothing

366
00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:59,109
opus is great this is a screenshot from
the iPhone version of it and you can

367
00:41:59,109 --> 00:42:05,578
verify the fingerprint so you can verify
the fingerprint of the server which are

368
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:11,010
connecting you to so you know you're not
being married milt by somebody's

369
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:18,000
certificate right so you can all the
hardware on the server and if you don't

370
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,789
don't deserve you can always check D
pick up into the server

371
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:32,319
be able to verify our Privacy Act secure
or signal for iPhone the programs that

372
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:39,558
do the same thing they're being produced
by Oprah whisper systems which is being

373
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:45,940
run by Moxie Marlins by hacker who has
done so many great things so you can see

374
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:54,829
people that are supporting the snow that
Laura Poitras the filmmaker that made

375
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:58,299
they introduced know that to the world

376
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:06,059
Bruce Schneier I'll be talking about him
earlier so we see what they write about

377
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:12,809
that software either signal either to
secure its a crypto same thing it's just

378
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:20,330
ridiculous for Android technologies for
iPhone

379
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:24,259
so they

380
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:30,560
described what he used for encryption
that is similar to deal tire to do great

381
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:36,320
off the record messaging protocol they
use all the greatest encryption

382
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:48,300
protocols and here is some more detailed
description of what they do and that is

383
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,590
really great they they provided for the
secrecy is all these programs that we're

384
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:57,420
talking about right for the secrecy
that's really great so even if

385
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:02,180
somebody's recording your encrypted
messages they cannot decrypt it now but

386
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:06,569
maybe they could decrypted later they
find their key this is not the case if

387
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:12,070
you have pulled secrecy sometimes called
perfect forward secrecy encryption even

388
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:18,400
if somebody steals your device structure
key from whatever means they cannot

389
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:29,220
decrypt previous communications that is
great so maybe somebody gets interesting

390
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:33,899
but it's really great great encryption
software and what is great about him

391
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:41,440
that almost all of it is being hidden
from the user and that is the great

392
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,609
thing about program

393
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:51,989
managing keys copying verified keys
that's ok that some they did we people

394
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:56,150
that we doing this for 15 years we can
understand we can do it and it's no

395
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,029
problem but for every age 44 average
user

396
00:45:00,029 --> 00:45:05,920
this is something like it even know what
I keys and these things

397
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,410
hide them almost exclusively you can
check really are key if you want to have

398
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:17,440
an option you can do it but you don't
have to have the software does it for

399
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:24,210
you and that that's the great thing
about this software you can recommend it

400
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:31,259
to anybody know your grandma to
everybody and your grandma house I'll

401
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:37,970
show you when you install it you have to
register your device with your phone

402
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:42,549
number so there's no password to
remember there's no user name is not

403
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:47,400
just your number just like viber does
like what's up

404
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,289
that's why I provide a really popular
here because you don't have to create an

405
00:45:53,289 --> 00:45:58,440
account at least the user's things do
they have to create account you just

406
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,789
type in your number in the system
doesn't for you might have seen in the

407
00:46:03,789 --> 00:46:08,920
previous lives how vibrant but separate
arranged in how is this

408
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,859
ranked you have a list of your users
from your mobile phone this is our

409
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:16,880
phones just right to be there is low

410
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:31,170
emails now I think you have confirmation
that it sent encrypted and this phone

411
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:37,410
that I've been testing it has received
it I haven't activated it long story but

412
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:41,910
when you said it and the guy receives it
you have to take my

413
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:47,529
to check marks here so you know that you
sent it greatly and you know the guy

414
00:46:47,529 --> 00:46:52,529
receded

415
00:46:52,529 --> 00:46:53,970
camera

416
00:46:53,970 --> 00:47:01,459
attachments are very kind I mean ok
that's a nice things to say hello This

417
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:09,000
Is It you have about to say verify your
identity and so you have your key casual

418
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,099
contact key and you say you you take two
devices you look at them together in the

419
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:19,859
same nobody is messing with your traffic
nobody's attacking you nobody's Sookie's

420
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:28,848
nobody's man in the middle or is this is
a mobile phone with camera you have a

421
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:34,869
bar code you can create a QR code
despite present here and it creates a QR

422
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:40,660
code which the other users can just
using scare you don't have to help my

423
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:47,000
team members here you would have to read
all the numbers to be totally sure if

424
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:54,700
nobody nobody's messing with your keys
with QR code it's much much much easier

425
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:04,419
dreadful or signal signal for iPhone
does both messages and voice calls in

426
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,690
the future

427
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:13,359
Android versions will be also emerged in
there for our like 14 text messages

428
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:21,040
twice once from 11 from 44 lokos same
thing same encryption same privacy same

429
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:30,880
everything also connected to your mobile
phone no best words though nothing just

430
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,920
calling

431
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,750
and my friend wasn't available when I
was making this presentation when he

432
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,640
answers

433
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:49,410
verify keys is really really really easy
you can hear the words in english words

434
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:57,259
appear which are something like simply
fight

435
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:05,390
cache of your trip to Key so you read
yours and he reads his they should match

436
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:11,069
they should be evil like two peas
bipartisan cash like like the whole key

437
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:19,030
and you just click OK mark you know so
you verified this is being tempered not

438
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:24,910
be intercepted grafica

439
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:29,509
these are the options that program you
know he can register your full but this

440
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:37,320
this is the options this is really this
is why you can use this to support you

441
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:44,060
can use this for everything like your
grandma is Rd options available proper

442
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:48,420
collaborate that's all the options that
program has now that's why is real and

443
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:57,110
it's privacy-preserving ok so we get to
the final program the judge to cure them

444
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:05,610
both for iPhone for Android when you
open it you see the options what he has

445
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:15,450
only change that second slide you always
trippin for compatibility reasons they

446
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:21,490
leave it to automatically attempt so
when it doesn't work you still have it

447
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:26,759
if it doesn't work you can still chat
with somebody but I say though I don't

448
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:32,130
want to check it out any option that
their daily doesn't work

449
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:37,680
then it sends texts in clear text you
know operation is easy you click new

450
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:48,310
account to use the rain you're hosting
site you can you have maybe tens of

451
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:59,759
thousands of servers for for my
presentation but you can really use any

452
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:10,220
server for for whatever you want there's
there's a huge list just so you see

453
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:15,149
there's a provider's really really
really a lot of providers you know

454
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:23,500
they're all ranked with grades so you
should only get of course those that

455
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:31,920
have green in both cases you can really
choose any kind of and you can see the

456
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:38,040
year that they're being founded so see
this is like 2003 some related right now

457
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:47,880
is really all services will be using it
for 15 years I've been is it that so you

458
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:54,000
can choose really anything you don't
have to use that goes servers but any

459
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:01,210
rate PC using a server password register
an account and with great about this

460
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:06,520
program you have this but incorrect be
at or if you have installed or but on

461
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:12,300
your phone it automatically use tourists
proxy and all your traffic is being

462
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:17,090
routed by tour so also your provider
enterprise there will not be able to

463
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:25,010
know that you're even the fact that
you're even using tor OTR to secure the

464
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:28,790
mere fact that you using

465
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:32,500
that there will ever be able to to see
our traffic of course but even the fact

466
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:37,670
that you're using particularly hidden
when you register a new account

467
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:43,170
you say ok out another account for my
friend send invite to get

468
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:49,260
gettin question they want to this
account ok this is also verify

469
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:56,670
fingerprint this is you take two devices
is this is the same it's ok because also

470
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:02,660
because this is mobile phone you have
can you are a code so we don't have to

471
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:10,040
read all those few lazy and minister to
judge this looks like this

472
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:17,720
ok we're sending for some reason first
ever message was failed didn't it didn't

473
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,759
go there

474
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:24,860
ok so it works and also you have to
check marks it said and it's received

475
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:34,210
when you you can see also voice picture
camera attachment whatever through the

476
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:43,390
same to secure services if you want to
accept yes ok you receive a picture like

477
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:50,580
forever and it stays in his program it
doesn't go to the gallery he doesn't do

478
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:55,770
it automatically to the Droid gallery to
know its secret you have to save it if

479
00:53:55,770 --> 00:54:07,610
you want to say that you have to say it
first you can't use door there's no

480
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:17,240
button 22 correct route or due to some
limitations both by Apple's iOS it goes

481
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:22,979
after 10 minutes in the background and
disconnect is the real problem they have

482
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:30,740
the plan to rename that app to read
built at the apt to be able to like VoIP

483
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:36,459
apps iPad apps don't have these problems
like mumble mumble these don't have

484
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,560
those problems

485
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:44,500
and I don't know how they manage to
probably that's why they initially went

486
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:54,460
to signal rifle because signal is both
VoIP or voice and future probably that's

487
00:54:54,460 --> 00:55:11,170
why they did that will be about it if
there are any questions I can answer

488
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:14,460
actually grow fonder

489
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:34,599
you said that hasn't earned encryption
no option yes why don't you need to or I

490
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:39,800
am I thought that I would had some more
time to explain it

491
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:47,490
these things I wanted to make another
part of the presentation but sadly we

492
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:53,580
don't have to have all these softwares
don't hide the fact that you're using it

493
00:55:53,580 --> 00:56:02,049
hid your destination they hide your
contacts the contents of your country

494
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:08,510
communications so that's totally private
that's totally secure but they don't

495
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:13,200
hide the fact that you using it there
are loads loads of commercial software

496
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:21,060
that classifies traffic that riders use
that services use they know that you're

497
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:27,080
using some kind of XMPP checked but they
don't know who you're sending it to the

498
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,359
euro was the name of your contact they
just know the IP address of your server

499
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:38,310
no communication of that so if you want
to be even more secure you can use

500
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:46,589
either repair or two or so not many
programs have your support in specially

501
00:56:46,589 --> 00:56:52,549
on mobile phones where you cannot easily
change practices that's actually being

502
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:57,990
done when you install door it's a it's
local processor have to use that and

503
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:03,549
this this is one of the rare programs
that allows you to do use to use door to

504
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:11,160
even hide the fact that you're using
XMPP particular software that's the

505
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,279
other part of the that that's the other
part of the

506
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:21,720
problem you're not riding your metadata
when you're communicating and sometimes

507
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:28,899
you're communicating with all that is
weird when I P away which which IP

508
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,260
address you're communicating with
depending on the protocol depending on

509
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:36,240
the software sometimes you're
communicating directly to the server so

510
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,330
there's ok he has communicated surgery
but sometimes but its peer-to-peer

511
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:46,920
communication you communicate with the
IP of your friend so somebody who may be

512
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,350
monitoring the traffic will find out
that you're being that you're using that

513
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:55,549
gripped software to communicate with
somebody and for how long

514
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:06,750
so that's gold medal and VPNs and the
tour enable it to hide or so that any

515
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,820
more questions

516
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:12,900
okay thank you
