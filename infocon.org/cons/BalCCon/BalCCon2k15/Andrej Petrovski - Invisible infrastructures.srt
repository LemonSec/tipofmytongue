1
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:28,939
welcome again this will be the first dog
today is invisible infrastructures by

2
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:42,030
$100 gift from share from this great
read and enjoy the dog hello everybody

3
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:49,370
who here feels comfortable walking in
English I mean just said that I know how

4
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,680
fast and how profound how deep can I go
with what terminology do all speak

5
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,299
English good enough

6
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:03,570
okay great my name is under boutros care
come from share foundation and this is

7
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,799
my colleague planning on also from from
share foundation he's a local hear from

8
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,580
them he said I come from belgrade today
we're going to talk about I hope that

9
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,960
you're all enjoying yourself and that
you like the conference I personally

10
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,169
liked it very much and my talk today are
atop today will be about invisible

11
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:30,720
infrastructures or as this subtitle here
says postcards from Internet each and

12
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,500
every one of us uses internet daily
basis but not as many of us are aware of

13
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,280
how the internet actually works and even
those of us who know because there are

14
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,170
some here as as far as I know even those
who know how the internet works have

15
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,630
some issues with the physical aspect of
the internet they don't really know the

16
00:01:53,630 --> 00:02:00,470
actual points where their traffic that
this is why we share foundation did a

17
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:07,060
research to check all the points or the
places where the serbian the internet

18
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,310
believes I hope that you enjoyed this
this presentation it has amazing

19
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:20,640
visualisations done by my colleague
flooding here and sit back and enjoy

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,519
this is the essence of the Internet is
some of you have done this at some point

21
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,610
it's got race through writing
researching is a special service or at

22
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,030
all which is integrated in most sober
operating systems using using ICMP

23
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:45,830
protocol to to trace the hopes of of
danger and basically it checks were

24
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:51,239
tracked the package from one point in
the internet which is your computer to

25
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:58,489
some server or a website so basically
traceroute this quite useful tool in in

26
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:04,540
network diagnostics but also be used it
as a tool for for research in order to

27
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:11,179
be able to see the entire the entire or
most of the serbian network I just

28
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:17,160
wanted make you aware that if you are
connected to a high-speed internet

29
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,859
service provider in serbia chances are
that during the past year or so

30
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,420
mayor of London have knocked on your
router at some point because we took all

31
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,440
the IP ranges that are publicly
available for for Serbia and trades

32
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:39,370
restarted all of the IP addresses
available so the internet basically

33
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:47,140
works based on packets IP packets which
are structured in in some logical way

34
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:54,958
just a general idea is that it they
contain a header or part with metadata

35
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:02,450
and and content part which contains the
actual content of the packet I don't

36
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:08,459
know how many of you are familiar with
the term metadata metadata are our data

37
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:15,660
about data or data that explain what the
actual data is about you can think of it

38
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,339
as as when you send a letter by by post
nobody does that anymore but I'm sure

39
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:26,210
you remember how it's done basically you
have our letter to try to put it in and

40
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,560
then look and then on the envelope he
writes address is your address the

41
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,950
address of the receiver

42
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:39,409
some stamps etc so think of of D header
of the IP packet SSD envelope or D I'll

43
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,280
take part which contains the dresses and
some other information that make sure

44
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,440
that the letter makes the right address
or in case if it's the receiver doesn't

45
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:57,920
want to receive the letter it comes back
to to you that there are many cool

46
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,280
things about these IP packets but what
we're going to talk about this is it's

47
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,979
where this package goal and where the
suspected stored at on this journey from

48
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:13,760
from serbia to or from the late notice
other ever 22 some server in this case

49
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,740
Facebook server in the USA the first
jump the IP packet makes when it

50
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,060
generated by your browser is your router
at home that's the black or white box

51
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:33,050
that gives you that gives you internet
then it goes to some local let's say

52
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:38,640
center that's set up by your ISP that
gathers sold a traffic from your

53
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,430
neighborhood let see and then it just
two days building in Belgrade it's as

54
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:49,310
baby fell apart this is for a new
high-speed which we base our I mean I'm

55
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,040
in this movie so that's why the new
researches is based on on that provider

56
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:01,040
anyways in this building all the packets
generated by as BB users are our our

57
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,070
collection afterwards

58
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:10,670
packet jumps to this building somewhere
in Germany in in Frankfurt more

59
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,810
precisely in in Europe is it's the
biggest internet exchange point internet

60
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:23,180
exchange point is is a point in tonight
network where many many ISPs

61
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,169
March and all their packets

62
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:34,280
come to this place and then their route
222 to some some other places so

63
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,549
actually this one of the biggest peering
points in in in in Europe its cool

64
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,229
building with a nice park and its
blurred because it's considered a

65
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:49,930
building off of national interest for
Germany's so you can't really see all

66
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,400
the sides of the building new churches
have a picture from a partner for this

67
00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:01,969
search by the way Google Street Google
Street pictures afterwards it goes to

68
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:07,560
Dublin in Ireland in the Republic of
Ireland where it gets copied and just

69
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,050
throw that away there is this cool place
in the UK which back in in today

70
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,630
indicate today's was a really famous
surfing place where people went to serve

71
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:25,909
on on these boards it's called to check
in in its sandy west coast of the United

72
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,060
Kingdom

73
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,880
this is a cool place because this is the
point where European traffic leads

74
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:41,940
Europe or it goes to to dus quite nearby
there is this is the hub HQ jQuery

75
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,740
actually the rotors and the servers are
located

76
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:54,270
this is also a really cool place it's
called GCHQ farm did you see it is I

77
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,349
don't know many of you know the
intelligence agency of the United

78
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:04,560
Kingdom and it's it's a beauty just a
couple of tens of kilometers away from

79
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,669
scrooge XO

80
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:12,240
intelligence agency by chance their
biggest their biggest satellite farm

81
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,180
near the point where the European
traffic leaves lives you know I'm sure

82
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,919
after he dies under the Atlantic goes
into dis this fiber cable is going to do

83
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,139
you this is this is in Tuckerton in New
Jersey

84
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,400
the lending point the lending point of
of the european internet basically if

85
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,260
you we have sched equity owner

86
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:41,620
under on-site that constantly since
packets and receives we have detected

87
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:49,430
turn in on on the east coast of the USA
that receives European traffic this is

88
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:57,589
what's known as the first capital of the
internet it's a connects the first place

89
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:04,210
where huge amount of data was was
gathered but nowadays there even even

90
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,860
bigger ones is it still works I mean
it's it's quite big

91
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:14,740
you can see by the party by the parking
around and it leaves it reaches the

92
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,500
destination which is the facebook data
center in in Forest City North Carolina

93
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,200
in dus something worth those think about
this building is that Facebook cannot

94
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,310
build it fast enough to 20 stalled all
the servers they they use so they

95
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:36,650
constantly by new land and build the
place which on the inside looks like

96
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:42,819
this journal people here they're just
eighty people working in Dec humongous

97
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:49,640
building that basically what they do is
they change batteries and the change

98
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,680
some spare parts it's there's no light
light automatically turns on if there is

99
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,579
a problem that some some some server so
it's practically it quite to ghost city

100
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,210
to humanize the humanities building not
a nice place to be but it does she

101
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:12,470
released her facebook photos and chats
and and statuses are so next time when

102
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,790
you type of status or post a photo you
just bear in mind that it it sleep

103
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,630
somewhere around here and i really
important thing to note is that even

104
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:28,410
when the package died so to speak or
it's it's completed its mission in life

105
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:36,370
and that's to reach from Novi Sad 222222
Facebook data center in dus it doesn't

106
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,520
actually died goes to hibernate maybe
and its further analyzed

107
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:53,240
and cloned into future as well for
purposes of data analytics etc can you

108
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,840
give a voice to London as well

109
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:04,790
22 may be explained in some other way
but under explain now basically

110
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:14,740
happening in less than one second when
you type in www.facebook.com in this

111
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:21,140
moment this tiny little packet go is
going through all of this country's is

112
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:26,910
going through all of these different
great buildings and finishing in this

113
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:33,140
place at the end and what is really
important for us is that like why we are

114
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,960
not aware of this process because it's
so fast and it's an invisible in our

115
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:45,120
golden with its research was to try to
understand what's going on behind so

116
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:52,330
everytime when you type www.facebook.com
this is what is going on and I will

117
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:58,140
continue further to just a couple of
other details that on the way in most of

118
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:03,660
these countries the pack it gets copied
and stored depends on the following the

119
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,900
stricken country it varies from six
months to 2222 years that at least in in

120
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:14,610
the European Union even though the
directive of Deut deal sweet retaining

121
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:21,830
data or more simple words retaining
information about towards some visitor

122
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:27,550
from serbia has promised us on the web
even though they were directed to track

123
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:33,560
least at indy you is is declared tumble
really many countries in the EU that

124
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:41,699
still do that and and the course of the
next step was ok we showed the road to

125
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:47,500
the package from serbia to dus now let's
see what's going on you serbia like

126
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,770
we don't really have a map of our own
country representing older servers and

127
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:57,640
two points in the network of vital
importance we find that we needed to see

128
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:03,860
who has watched part of the market and
found out as its not really super hard

129
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:10,070
to find out you just get the IP ranges
and and see who has so many IP addresses

130
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:17,220
to put things on lower level every
device that is connected to the Internet

131
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,790
IP address ok so this is this

132
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:31,410
180 point how we can know that those ip
addresses belonged to someone in serbia

133
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:38,469
because there is like organization is
distributing by countries range of IP

134
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,560
addresses so they're saying from this
number to that number this is all the

135
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,569
devices that will be assigned to the
different hardware computers or Reuters

136
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:55,650
in serbia and then those number numbers
those ip addresses are separated two

137
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:01,180
different internet service providers
Telekom Serbia get one range as bigoted

138
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,719
another range orion gets through the
range and so on and then at the end when

139
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,450
you are using Internet basically you are
using one of those ip addresses that are

140
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:16,420
assigned to the Internet Service
Provider the to those ip addresses from

141
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:24,540
European register of IP addresses that
way you can maybe you have maybe notice

142
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,390
that are sometimes when you watch
YouTube it says you did video is not

143
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,550
available in your country that's how I
actually did you choose serving knows

144
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,329
that your answer be there also other
ways but basically does the most common

145
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,010
way to to see where you're located

146
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:48,360
Telekom Serbia has the biggest portion
of the IP address space assigned to

147
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,820
serbia denning says BB and some water
some other providers what you're going

148
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,899
to see now

149
00:14:54,899 --> 00:15:02,329
logical maps during physical like land
map but logical maps of the internet off

150
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:08,089
of Serbia and what I want you to think
about as concentration of the points of

151
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:17,949
the host at what we did basically all of
those ip addresses and we created well a

152
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:21,670
little packets that went to your
computer

153
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:27,069
visitor computer computer and told us
through each other points this package

154
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:32,029
came to your computer on the way back we
get information about this dress and

155
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:38,999
then we use different softwares for data
visualization to make a maps and this is

156
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:46,189
going to suck and they're really cool so
this is one provider called absolute ok

157
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:53,368
it's one of the smaller ones this is
already on it looks like space and this

158
00:15:53,369 --> 00:16:05,179
is Telekom Serbia just remember this one
this is the University you use it at

159
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:14,010
your university is part of the Emerson
introduces the post btw

160
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:23,910
Bell tel has been one of the second
largest when basically so this is a map

161
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,900
representing each and every one of them
different color represents another

162
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:35,790
speech so and these points where you
have bigger concentration are there or

163
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:42,130
more points and during the Middle you
can see the points where they are where

164
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:48,680
they connect between the internet and
telecom so but OK except of this like a

165
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:56,380
visual part of the team that it looks
like really cool and the question is

166
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,310
what we can do about that how we can
read those maps the main thing here it's

167
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:10,589
the two can see for example to big big
bowl and that means that in the in the

168
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,619
middle of those both there is like 10 or
fewer IP addresses that means like

169
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:20,829
servers that all the day all the other
Reuters our servers that are connected

170
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:26,690
in Telecom is basically going through
this two points so that means that the

171
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:32,440
network of Telecom is really high list
and centralized what that means that

172
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:39,780
means if Telekom Serbia for example want
to filter or block some of the website

173
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:46,940
or or for example if they want maybe to
read all the traffic and to collect

174
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:53,370
information about the traffic going on
they will need to install two other

175
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,290
machines near to this points and they
will be able just with those two

176
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:04,340
machines to get a lot of traffic is
going on on different networks it's a

177
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:11,850
different situation so for example in in
in because it's not so centralized

178
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:17,699
network if you want to track what's
going on then you will need to track

179
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,110
here

180
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,559
much easier because it's like
centralized yeah I think that there is

181
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,750
already some filtering in in in I'm
resort on a local level so every

182
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,470
university because every faculty
practically has released to websites

183
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,970
that they block for instance I think
that they don't allow you to or

184
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:38,860
something like that

185
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,120
torrent on some of the University

186
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:48,389
what's filtering in general filtering is
controlling what goes to the end user or

187
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:53,730
whether gender user or you at home will
be able to access some website website

188
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,520
on the on the internet it's it's done in
many countries like Turkey and Russia

189
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,030
India Pakistan and and some other
countries as well under the pretext of

190
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:09,940
national security or child pornography
one of the most common excuses but what

191
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,340
do you think of Internet filtering did
it it basically is censorship in a way

192
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:23,709
because government or any government in
the world trying to filter or prevent

193
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:28,330
access to some websites that are
considered inappropriate for the culture

194
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:33,260
political system etc there are many ways
to go around these children's but I'm

195
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,710
not going to get it in debt now

196
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,340
it's important why it's important that
the internet remains decentralize

197
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,918
because if you have a network that is
highly centralized and the central point

198
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,220
or something needs some point near the
center gets corrupt in any way gets

199
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,960
hacked or whatever then turn that reduce
compromise because it it in that point

200
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,770
you have everything all the traffic best
trick that point for example in telecom

201
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:06,510
if you have a decentralized network if
part of the network gets gets corrupt or

202
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:12,340
affect their mean the remaining part of
the network can't can properly so that

203
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,750
is why it's it's highly important that
we fight for for decentralized internet

204
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:22,320
and and neutral internet as opposed to
the balkanization of the internet one of

205
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,510
the most sorry excuse for a term which
means that every country country gets

206
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,940
sovereignty over their own part of the
internet which means that for example if

207
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,820
the russian government decided that no
Twitter for russian citizen date date

208
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:44,370
they have a legitimate right to do that
now that sample so this is the central

209
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:49,928
point where these providers merchants
quote socks or serbian open exchange

210
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:55,820
which is the first and as far as I know
the only successful internet exchange

211
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,970
point in serbia it's operated as as as
an organization and they have their own

212
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:06,760
hierarchy and and way of controlling so
basically you saw the networks

213
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:12,830
individual in our now those like
validation is going to show how those

214
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:18,020
networks are interconnected between each
other so that's basically the internet

215
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:24,179
for example year your friend is on
telecom and your honor's be in order for

216
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:29,510
you to be able to communicate their
natural need to merge at some point this

217
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:38,149
is this is basically dead . this and
other important thing for us was to see

218
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:42,908
what the Serbian citizens actually visit
online there is this website called the

219
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:49,360
Lex it's run by by Amazon it's it's
owned by Amazon which maintains list of

220
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,168
most popular

221
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:55,029
websites for a country so we got the
list for serbia we took the 100 most

222
00:21:55,029 --> 00:22:02,029
most popular websites and we want to see
where do where they hosted where they're

223
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:09,210
actually physically posted so we the
reason for this is that you want to to

224
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:14,960
just make a route like with it for the
Facebook packet in in in the first in

225
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,840
the first story just see which countries
you go when you're sitting at home and

226
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,049
and browsing some some website on the
internet because we sell them think off

227
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:29,149
it's really hard to think of leaving the
country when you're in your own

228
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:33,268
apartment doing something online you you
don't get the feeling that you actually

229
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:37,919
not only get out of your home but you in
most cases leave your country or even

230
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,259
your continent you go to USC and we are
not really aware of that and it's super

231
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:48,320
important to be aware that because
changes in in in in laws in all of these

232
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,220
countries affected us affect us really
really seriously so they yellow line we

233
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:59,809
line which you can see around here is
the national border of serbia old old

234
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:04,690
the websites that are inside the yellow
line are in serbia and all of them that

235
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,999
are outside our outside of it so
basically on the first view you can see

236
00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:15,039
that most of them are outside but let's
just have a couple of couple of things

237
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:15,989
around here

238
00:23:15,989 --> 00:23:23,840
centralization of there is a question to
lesion in couple of points in in in this

239
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,119
picture so first of all most of the
websites are hosted in serbia are at one

240
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:34,149
single provider hosting provider which
is called mainstream its provider from

241
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:41,439
belgrade so also in some other providers
but just a couple of them

242
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,619
unitarian telecom they have H one or two
or three website so most of the let's

243
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:53,059
say the representative number is 800 so
we took the hundred most most visited

244
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:56,610
sites so most of them are outside but

245
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:02,040
those who are inside our most of them
are with main street and another

246
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:08,850
important thing is you CDs don't in here
it's again a centralization point

247
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:13,250
because if you visit any website in
serbia chances are that you're going to

248
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:18,049
pass through to that point which again
talks about centralization of you talked

249
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:25,490
about leaving the country there is also
a point which which is highly

250
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,100
centralized and through each you visit
many web sites like this one or maybe

251
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:35,399
this one here so most of them are
interconnected and and highly

252
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:41,200
centralized which means that at some
point somebody sitting somewhere 1000

253
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,410
what websites are visited by a huge
number of of citizens of Serbia or

254
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:54,190
people's lives in serbia at at at any
point of time so as I said I just a

255
00:24:54,190 --> 00:25:00,230
little bit of Statistics again I
mentioned coping detain storing data in

256
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,740
data retention I hope the church leader
with the term but I'm just gonna repeat

257
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,370
explanation once again so that I'm sure
that you know what it is

258
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:15,159
data retention means that the country
makes the law that as for the ice peace

259
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:20,380
or the telecom operators that the stored
data about your activity online for a

260
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:26,360
certain period so that they can use that
data in case there is a court court

261
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,168
process going on and they need some
evidence most most of the excuses are

262
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:35,970
organized crime smuggling child
pornography and terrorism international

263
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:42,100
terrorism which are quite a poor excuse
for data retention is because studies

264
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:47,689
have shown that data retention is not an
effective fighting terrorism or any

265
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:54,710
other type of crime so to speak so let's
have a closer look at that these blue

266
00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:00,640
points on on the right is your source
computer and on the left the blue points

267
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,260
are the points where the data you

268
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,870
your data practically when the visiting
those website it's it's called peace so

269
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:14,300
we see a huge concentration of of decent
loop and the White Point Sur where the

270
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:21,780
website is actually hosted so we have a
huge frequency of these blue dots in in

271
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:29,190
Budapest Vienna and front so these
points his government's the Austrian and

272
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:34,880
German government can easily see what
interests serbian people have because

273
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:43,180
they have all the data are retained in
their points what we can see is that

274
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:50,810
most or data passes through you and and
into you as just a little bit of

275
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:59,740
statistics which I personally don't like
but it's useful sometimes only 27% of

276
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,029
websites in serbia are so said

277
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:10,989
hosting serbia please only for fourteen
of them are posted with with mainstream

278
00:27:10,989 --> 00:27:19,299
which means that I'll 200 or 14% as it's
quite a high percentage for a single

279
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:26,320
single hosting provider then the entire
you can see it's it's actually 13

280
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:35,029
because I just tried to do that the
entire the number of countries in which

281
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:41,119
you good when when surfing calling
chances are it's thirteen or or less

282
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:49,658
17% of the traffic passes through 17 in
17 cases out of 27 the traffic passes

283
00:27:49,659 --> 00:28:01,799
true salts or serbian open open exchange
65% remains edu 40% is in Germany while

284
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:08,619
11 this is this is a really fun fun fact
not really relevant but quite

285
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:09,379
interesting

286
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:15,789
1111 websites or 11 percent of these
websites are hosted in the Netherlands

287
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:21,789
that the reason for this is that the
Netherlands Holland has quite a liberal

288
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:31,169
laws regarding pornography so these are
mostly internet pornography websites 36

289
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:38,139
percent off all day of 100 most visited
sites in serbia are are indeed you said

290
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:43,309
this is the map so it's it's also quite
centralized because it doesn't leave it

291
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:49,739
it it's only in Europe and and in dus we
don't really go to Russia and Australia

292
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:55,049
Africa South America the serbian
internet or the most popular websites in

293
00:28:55,049 --> 00:29:03,080
serbia can be put in this one box of
Europe and USA countries if not not all

294
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,120
of the European countries but some of
them so

295
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,820
we also can see that the trier quite
centralized and in this way again and

296
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:20,500
now we come to a really really fun story
you have heard the word case you

297
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,590
probably like eating cookies but there
is also another type of cookies there

298
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:31,309
are on the internet cookies are pieces
of data that contains some information

299
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:36,300
that can be related to you in some way
so that the next time you visit your

300
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,659
website you have better better user
experience thats your location

301
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:49,050
your lets a user name in some cases your
posture also so they they contain them

302
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:55,450
stated that gives really really
sensitive and important information that

303
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:03,929
can be related to you most of the
websites use case and it's because it's

304
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:07,950
it's quite convenient because the use
Google Analytics which is a Google

305
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:12,630
service that allows the web
administrators to track the number of

306
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:18,660
visitors see where dear visitors come
from a long day they said on the website

307
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:23,900
owner information how many claims they
had on on certain links and other

308
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,320
information that information to the
quite useful for them but they're really

309
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,389
intruding our privacy so why should
google know how long do I read a single

310
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:39,020
tax or why should google send me
advertisements all because the purpose

311
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:44,550
of these focus is to make a profile of
every user so that they can send them

312
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:50,970
certain type of advertisements when when
they're online you have certainly noted

313
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:57,750
when you google something then after
some time you get on your underside of

314
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,870
your browser

315
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,820
advertisements related related to your
search for instance if you I don't know

316
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:09,610
Google rent an apartment in Novi Sad
then you get booking.com telling you

317
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:13,639
that there is this nice apartment in
Novi Sad or near Novi Sad

318
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:21,039
this is based on on on on on cookies so
the business model of most of the

319
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:26,549
biggest internet companies nowadays is
not making you pay for the service but

320
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:31,309
offering something and getting your data
which is their currency

321
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:38,908
entire amount of the value of data on
European level two years ago was 300

322
00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:47,269
interesting billion GBP pounds and until
2020 there is this estimate that it will

323
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:52,489
that it will reach a trillion which is a
humongous humongous amount of money it's

324
00:31:52,489 --> 00:31:55,999
not the money that you get but its
amount of money that some company gets

325
00:31:55,999 --> 00:32:05,070
for using pure data in most cases these
companies Google it's been deployed in

326
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:12,509
many websites so these are the websites
in serbia that implement Express has the

327
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:17,649
biggest number of cookies then you have
to study telegraphy etcetera

328
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:21,908
so in the middle

329
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:28,859
we have two types of cookies they they
they they have of course the most common

330
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:33,549
one is Google Analytics because of the
reason I already told you that we have

331
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:40,249
facebook facebook cookie doughs in many
different shapes and sizes from sheer

332
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:47,139
button to LIKE button to Google to
Facebook comments and other content they

333
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:49,620
they provide they provide

334
00:32:49,620 --> 00:33:00,739
4344 the website to make again simple
you have those companies Google Facebook

335
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:08,820
and other one really really extremely
rich so they're earning like fifty six

336
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:16,510
billion dollars for example Google every
year that's a lot that's like more than

337
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:23,040
probably serbia or more than a lot of
countries in the world and from where

338
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:30,590
this money is coming from so the only
business model that they have to collect

339
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:39,840
data about your movement on the internet
and to transform this data into some

340
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,649
analytics that means into some profile
and then they're selling those profile

341
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:54,760
to people who want to advertise on their
website so the only business model the

342
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:00,620
Google heavies is that there is nothing
else and every time when they want to

343
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:08,000
have some new service new thing it's
basically to support this business

344
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:18,770
models to have more data about you if
it's for example for homes that can like

345
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:24,759
monitoring your electricity use surgeon
temperature and other things to collect

346
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:32,120
more data about your behavior that means
that you want to call it means that you

347
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:38,330
referred to for example if you're
growing marijuana on the

348
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:44,279
don't do that but if you are doing that
you will spend a lot of electricity no

349
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:50,440
to put the lamps and 22 heat just go on
and tell them how to do that and and

350
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:56,240
basically if someone is able to track
how many electricity to use his able to

351
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:02,450
track you and to find you because of
that basically what Google is doing is

352
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,509
trying to transform this information
about you and to create a profile of you

353
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:14,410
are you like this deal like that and
then to sell those profile store and I

354
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,279
would an Indian South you don't sell
your boat show you some some

355
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,700
advertisements this thing is going to
escalate escalate to some point with the

356
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:29,259
introduction of Internet of Things
because then smart houses it is whatever

357
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:34,410
because then we have many many many
devices that have some different sorts

358
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:39,270
of sensors for example the refrigerator
that has an IP address and some

359
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:45,470
interface that collects data on how much
milk you have so many eggs do it a week

360
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:51,500
etcetera so these teams get more and
more personal by the day it you should

361
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:58,920
take note is Google implements many of
these many of these cookies but in the

362
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:06,260
future this number is gonna grow
exponentially at least my opinion just

363
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:11,210
to have a look at the company's of
course Google Inc is is the one who owns

364
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:16,360
most of these cookies then we have
facebook and genius which is an

365
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,990
interesting an interesting example
because it's company based in Poland a

366
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,709
thing or two about you

367
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:29,210
industry Europe anyway so it's the
company offers marketing services for

368
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:33,840
companies from serbia so it's
interesting for this it's it's really

369
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,070
interesting for this market here because
they have the most personalized data

370
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:43,970
force of serbian the serbian citizens
day did there is so many companies from

371
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:48,990
serbia actually go to Jimmy S&S ok I
have this advertisement here just please

372
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,629
send it to people

373
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:55,130
I dunno teenagers attending high school

374
00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:01,119
interested in sports and then you have
jock or some other sports vision company

375
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:08,849
that sells sneakers because they know
the deeply football just again something

376
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:11,440
and then the numbers

377
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,740
decrease slightly ninety percent of the
websites have integrated at least one

378
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:26,540
Google cokie 46 integrate Facebook cokie
36 jimmy is plenty for Twitter etc

379
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:33,619
seventeen different Google on seventeen
different third-party applications or

380
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:38,579
seventeen different types of services
that keep a cookie on your on your

381
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:43,200
important thing to know is that the
cookie is not on the internet but on

382
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,868
your own computers so they every time
you access the website you send the

383
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:54,150
kooky along with the requests for their
website and that's called a online sit

384
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:59,650
there is a hundred and eighteen in the
50 most popular sites and Serbia

385
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:05,940
integrated Google Google party
applications ninety percent of them are

386
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:13,619
integrated in 45 of 50 out of 50 what it
means that you even you don't use Google

387
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:17,630
and that's probably not possible but
even if you're not using Google in

388
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:23,260
nineteen when you land on ninety percent
of the website there are cookies Delta

389
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:31,390
googled it you are on the web site and
basically that means that once instead

390
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:41,990
of visiting one website you on average
you visit 7.3 other websites so because

391
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:47,759
the average number of integrated cookies
per website is 7.3 which means that you

392
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,369
don't want to visit the website you
actually type the URL address of but you

393
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:58,540
also visit 7.3 are other websites 08
different servers on the Internet

394
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,369
almost more than eight service on the
Internet

395
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:06,680
know that you visited a certain website
a certain type that you're interested in

396
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:13,740
in in in certain think I'm not going to
go too much in detail regarding these

397
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:21,410
just I think we should we could because
this is an interesting one it's it's due

398
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:26,250
proportion of where there's companies
that don't the cookies come from so you

399
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:32,250
can see this big black stripe it's it's
dus course then we have serbia somewhere

400
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:38,450
in here with this small small stripe and
not many other we have poland is because

401
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:47,870
genius is is is in poland so the only be
influential actors in in in serbia

402
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:53,779
regarding cookies to you as because most
of the companies are actually register

403
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:59,680
their so this is something that is going
to talk about mostly I'm just gonna jump

404
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,450
in let me let me try some code to make
some kind of summary of the things

405
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:09,649
before first we understand understood
like when we are visiting some website

406
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:14,500
we are traveling to seven different
countries leaving out of the race and

407
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,810
the way in other countries on the way
can collect the data about us most of

408
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:24,560
those countries that we are visiting our
across the ocean so it's United States

409
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,740
and the rest of the countries in the EU
so our internet is not so big it's

410
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,910
basically serbia

411
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:39,220
United States than we realize when
you're visiting some website there are

412
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:43,770
other people who have information that
you visited that website and then we

413
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,810
realize that this is the main business
model of the biggest internet companies

414
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:53,990
that exist today in the world so they're
able to collect a lot of information

415
00:40:53,990 --> 00:41:02,200
about you so the players who can collect
internet service provider can collect

416
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:07,549
information government can collect
information and companies can collect

417
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,920
information and also their

418
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,070
redistributing this information to other
companies

419
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:20,660
this is some kind of summary of the
things and what we explain now they can

420
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:25,779
collect information of what we which
websites we are visiting how long we are

421
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:29,990
staying but what we are collecting what
we are searching on the internet so on

422
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:33,259
so on and they're using this information
to sell you more thing

423
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:39,460
but this is not the end of the story
because there is a mobile home mobile

424
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:46,060
phone is basically the biggest tracking
device that exists that ever existed so

425
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:58,560
it's the most ultimate surveillance
device has a smartphone so

426
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,180
we will explain why this is the story
number but this is the right number

427
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:13,440
three or so when you are downloading
application York leaking something like

428
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,600
this except yes yes yes I accept accept
accept and more unless you're you're

429
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,290
never reading basically what you are
accepting so we did some kind of

430
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:32,330
research so we started the most popular
applications for mobile phones and try

431
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:37,920
to analyze what kind of information you
gave them permission to collect from

432
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:46,030
your mobile home and so for example
Facebook what we can see here they can

433
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:51,460
collect location as the mass media files
camera microphone life connection

434
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:55,640
DeviceID call information other things
but when you go deeper and more into

435
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:02,069
details you basically understand that
they can collect more or less

436
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:07,140
everything that exists on your phone
maybe they're not collecting this way

437
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:14,040
purpose of tracking you or something but
in any case you gave them a possibility

438
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:23,730
to do so if they want and this is the
same for example with the Google Google

439
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:35,770
it collecting the game like 10 different
permissions but for example being

440
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:42,740
application made from Microsoft for
example that is doing the same thing and

441
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,870
you could see that being is collecting
much less a much less they're gonna

442
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:51,470
think less things then Google so
basically for the same service they're

443
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:56,020
not collecting so many things and then
you have doctor logo is basically like

444
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:02,540
privacy oriented browser they're not
collecting almost entity so then we

445
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,230
start to 22

446
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:10,890
research like some kind of domestic
application like mostly news

447
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:17,750
among the public and so on and then we
found like also interesting things that

448
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:24,770
for example quoted can read sensitive
log data what it means says it is

449
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:32,150
located that means when did you call
someone who did you call how long

450
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:40,580
duration of the call and song song and
career one news website can collect

451
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:45,600
those information about you why they
need that I don't know what they're

452
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:52,009
doing that but what is also like really
scary on this it's that when you are

453
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:59,480
buying from I think the electronic
mobile phone application it's already

454
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:10,020
proving that means that you never gave
them give them approval to do that came

455
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:16,460
with the phone so this is the things
that you should always have in mind when

456
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:22,150
you are installing some application
please do read what is written there

457
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:31,400
because this is the price you're paying
for free so

458
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:39,630
the most intrusive applications that
there are regarding this permissions are

459
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:47,630
of course this fiber but facebook
Messenger song every time when you hear

460
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:55,770
the viper for example it's company that
it's worth of $50,000,000 or sell for

461
00:45:55,770 --> 00:46:03,259
200 million dollars you should ask
yourself based on what they don't

462
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,559
produce they

463
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:11,900
location is free they don't produce an
offer from where those fifty million

464
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,460
dollars came from in most of the cases
coming from the day today they are

465
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:24,779
collecting and selling or marketing
purposes or to some other other

466
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:34,869
companies there is no any other business
model so all of those things with

467
00:46:34,869 --> 00:46:39,829
organizational stuff you can see on its
website that we made for this research

468
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:44,809
is called labs that address so you can
go in in detail and try to understand

469
00:46:44,809 --> 00:46:55,220
all of this but there are like privacy
oriented or anonymity oriented software

470
00:46:55,220 --> 00:47:01,868
applications for example or bought some
kind of mobile version of tour basically

471
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:09,720
not connect collecting anything just
what they really need to do to run at

472
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:14,868
the start up to have whole network
access view network connections and this

473
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:21,180
is the for example if you are installing
application for example a clean master

474
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,580
that should clean your

475
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:34,190
from different kind of dumb things you
can also check what they are what they

476
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:38,520
are doing on the back and you will
understand that they are like collecting

477
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:47,660
lot of different information about you
so this is basically some kind of

478
00:47:47,660 --> 00:48:05,460
summary of our mobile home repair
missions and now we will this is like we

479
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:14,660
try to understand like which of those
permissions are our Privacy can harm

480
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:22,180
your privacy and and basically from here
to here most of those things can be like

481
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:28,379
have a problem with the privacy and all
those likely

482
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:38,510
permissions are you can find more
information about this and this is our

483
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:49,300
last thing it's related to surveillance
and metadata retention infrastructure so

484
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:54,750
it's basically how the mobile phone how
how they are receiving information from

485
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:59,110
your mobile phone and how they're
tracking your method eight so basically

486
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:03,150
you have a mobile phone inside of your
mobile phone have something that it's

487
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:08,690
called him a number email number

488
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:13,840
identifier for the mobile home inside of
the mobile phone you have a SIM cards

489
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:21,120
and most of you to sign some contract
with their sore or so you're giving your

490
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,700
names

491
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:29,950
your street address number of other
phone call away so they have basically

492
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:36,439
information who you are then your mobile
phone he's doing three different things

493
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:42,290
you can do all he can do SMS and he can
do they transfer in all of this is

494
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:50,640
called GSM communication and how things
are going on around you in most of the

495
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,578
cases you're surrounded with the three
different base stations what are the

496
00:49:54,579 --> 00:50:02,700
basic PlayStation PlayStation sold those
gray around the city

497
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:09,118
the fields as a matter and most all the
time your mobile phone is connected to

498
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:19,060
three of them and so when you called
someone this signal is going to to the

499
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:27,980
base station and then from the best base
station it's going to something that

500
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:35,180
it's called mobile switching center and
this is where the magic is starting to

501
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:42,348
happen in this moment which asks enter
the race packet it's the similar to

502
00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:49,750
Internet the packets every call every
data packet content and on the top have

503
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:56,140
a header headers and headers means
you're calling for how long from which

504
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:03,348
base stations also on this is collected
copied to something to some kind of

505
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:13,859
database of metadata in serbia those
companies MPs Telenor and so on

506
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:22,870
they need to collect those metadata and
keep them for twelve months and then

507
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:30,240
so you have like alot alot alot of
metadata about each of us so far they

508
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,439
have every time when you called someone
when you send SMS when you move some do

509
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:41,050
something basically they have some trees
in metadata that you did that and

510
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:45,870
they're keeping this information in some
kind of database base the main question

511
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:54,440
is how and who can access those metadata
by our research there's different ways

512
00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:11,520
that how different agencies can be like
to court so all of them can access those

513
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,940
men metadata two different ways for
example how it should be done is that

514
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:20,980
they are like calling and asking them

515
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:27,370
ok serious a court order can you give me
metadata about this person this is like

516
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:33,160
usual thing but it's not the part of the
reality but the another part of the

517
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:38,649
reality is that they have some kind of
application for direct access to this

518
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:46,720
metadata and so they can search through
the database by the telephone number by

519
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,919
the location of the base station and
songs so what it means for example for

520
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:58,330
example the few that have mobile phone
now you are now connected to base

521
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:04,870
station know if i if i search now
through this database who is connected

522
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:10,060
to base station in this moment I will
know exactly who is sitting in this

523
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:18,370
industry and this is the crowd there how
would they are tracking criminals are

524
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:22,819
attracting doing like lot of political
activist

525
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:27,440
because there is a different illegal
ways how to access this information

526
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:35,130
through these applications and so on so
our research told us that like there is

527
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:41,920
like a huge amount of data that is
analyzed on a legal way that it's not

528
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:50,750
true this court system and so on so you
can see more I think we are now we have

529
00:53:50,750 --> 00:54:00,750
five minutes so this is basically you
can read more on on on on our website

530
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:09,980
and you can find out how those different
way behind other people are accessing to

531
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:15,960
our metadata maybe leave this five
minutes if someone have any kind of

532
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:41,230
questions about anything related to any
questions

533
00:54:41,230 --> 00:55:02,380
guidance on what to do about it so yeah
about your activity on the internet

534
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:05,810
being tracked and what you can do about
it

535
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:10,640
asking from the position of a user how
to protect yourself from

536
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:18,700
so there is this thing called and luck
plus some of you made it's basically a

537
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:25,899
plug-in for your websites that blocks d
ads so by blocking the ads in blocks a

538
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:31,570
huge huge amount of cookies but on the
other hand you can configure your web

539
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:32,400
browser

540
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,060
especially for use Mozilla or or tour
which I strongly recommend you can turn

541
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:42,830
off the dakotas it'll be a little bit
inconvenient in the sense that you will

542
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:48,529
need to sign in everytime you open I
don't know gmail or whatever because you

543
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:54,440
don't store anything your passwords or
or whatever you use so just turn on the

544
00:55:54,440 --> 00:56:01,100
cookies on your website used at luck +
and most preferably used tor tor browser

545
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:06,500
which is super easy to download insult
or project though torque download you

546
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:17,840
said in your pretty much safe I found
out about a nice blacken a similar to

547
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:30,460
block a bit more user friendly flexible
its privacy from the Electronic Frontier

548
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:37,510
Foundation its cool and I would
recommend to turn it on and nice feature

549
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:45,690
of it and you will see the number of
cookies that they detected so you can

550
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:50,080
see for yourself like the things that
you showed us in this in this

551
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:58,009
presentation you can see for yourself
what individual sites are ya how many I

552
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:05,320
encourage you to do so whatever to look
as many kisses as as you can and just

553
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:10,810
one more comment because I am NOT
security expert I'm generic programmer

554
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:12,230
and I just

555
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:23,369
development particularly on Android
finally green so yeah technically if

556
00:57:23,369 --> 00:57:27,760
they are requiring you to do that you
cannot allow something that doesn't mean

557
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:35,119
necessarily that they are doing that i
mean the the plastic example is for

558
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:42,510
example you want to make a flash flood
light that requires you think of the

559
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:50,160
camera axis direction so you see a
flashlight asking the camera for me so

560
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:58,069
yeah things can exploit I give you the
next release some master stuff in there

561
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:02,390
but yeah sometimes it is sometimes it's
not so

562
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:08,859
yeah I mean there is also these good
trend which I'm really glad about going

563
00:58:08,859 --> 00:58:14,000
on that the applications ask for a
permission when they need to do a

564
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,099
certain tests for example you need to
switch on the torch flashlight Danny

565
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:24,099
test shoot these action asked you to
give her permission to use flashlights

566
00:58:24,099 --> 00:58:27,859
camera whatever and then you give it but
it's not a permanent permanent

567
00:58:27,859 --> 00:58:34,269
permission so these event-based
permissions are much better approach

568
00:58:34,269 --> 00:58:39,479
that's something I S had and that's
something and retool have enduring next

569
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:44,490
the next edition so things are getting
better but we still need a strong voice

570
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:48,569
from the community i mean you cannot
blame the developers for asking to use

571
00:58:48,569 --> 00:58:53,950
those permissions you can blame me to
Google on Google India review system

572
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:58,180
because they they need to review the
application really needs to use older

573
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:02,700
this all those things so yeah things
things are getting better hopefully in

574
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,740
in debt in in that way

575
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:17,970
ok questions comments we're kind of
running out of time but maybe one more I

576
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:20,100
personally

577
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:31,000
shows also how many cookies and one more
thing about GSM base stations did you

578
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:40,300
know that we are all base station you
can connect if you choose our network

579
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:51,260
operator on mobile phone we don't keep
metadata please try to break our deal

580
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:58,780
with this research was to try to
understand the map system oK what's

581
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:04,730
going on and what are the different
forms of our behavior and how this

582
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:11,010
network looks like and basically for
every different aspect you have a

583
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:18,550
probably different to how to avoid the
problem for example if you don't want to

584
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:22,610
be tracked locally in your country then
used bpm

585
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:27,940
browse the internet from another country
if this is what you want to do if you

586
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:33,980
want to be anonymous settings like this
store network if you want to understand

587
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:40,790
who is tracking you online use goes to
Rio or or privacy better or something so

588
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:49,090
we just wanted to somehow map different
kind of problems that we see and not to

589
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:55,310
give solution but just to do a very
earnest about the things I hope we will

590
01:00:55,310 --> 01:01:04,060
maybe next year to the solutions we also
have also you can check everything on

591
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:09,019
our website labs or terrace ok one more
thing

592
01:01:09,019 --> 01:01:17,508
did you know that there are two parties
meetings are gathering so you can learn

593
01:01:17,509 --> 01:01:26,319
how to use tools for cryptography tools
for blocking these kind of crackers we

594
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:33,199
will hear a trip to party here after
after the soldiering workshop if anyone

595
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:37,859
is interested in so they're learning how
to organize your encrypted protecting

596
01:01:37,859 --> 01:01:43,598
you have that one's own yes there there
is a book up to throw out so it's super

597
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,309
simple super easy and you should share
it among your friends even though as we

598
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:51,460
had the opportunity to live too

599
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:55,820
here last night ripped apart this or not
the solution but at this point I think

600
01:01:55,820 --> 01:02:02,350
that the only option we have so just try
to educate yourself as much as possible

601
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:09,060
about all of this has once again led the
IRS check it out it's kind of cool and

602
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,000
that's it thank you very much
