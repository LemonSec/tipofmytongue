1
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,020
ok hello everyone

2
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,290
saw the title of this talkies arlen
zombie apocalypse by Alexander please

3
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:34,810
read him in the dark

4
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:41,020
hi and welcome everybody my name is
Alexander Merkel amateur radio call sign

5
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,680
thanking you for seven times we went
from extreme and today I want to talk

6
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,150
about

7
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:53,129
automatically establishment and the
zombie apocalypse first let me ask are

8
00:00:53,130 --> 00:01:01,140
there any ham radio operators in the
audience today no yes it's very from New

9
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:10,570
York nice no Europe your short list the
right ok that's very that's great so

10
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,880
that part of my hobby and I'm very glad
to see you here today of course

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,649
statistics with say that somebody will
be a ham radio operator after order to

12
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,110
millions of us know a little bit of a
small state worldwide I think some

13
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:31,470
700,000 in the us- and I promise to talk
a little bit about in our

14
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,440
interconnection between Meridian the
parking movement

15
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,100
thinking it does have some some
connecting points to but I'm going to be

16
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,030
going to get back to that I promise in
the end of the presentation but let's

17
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,080
start with with this first so the
automatic link establishment of zombie

18
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,649
apocalypse so I didn't want to make it
you know too boring because the usual if

19
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:05,700
you're getting cold when there are some
unusual things happening for example

20
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:12,700
flaws which lies to reach must have laws
here and amateur radio operators give

21
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,290
their best to make communication
interrupted

22
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,959
you know we will do our part when there
are some dangers and Unitech a reliable

23
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,560
means of communication so basically when
you have a zombie apocalypse what

24
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:43,290
happens is that ok so the question of
danger in this hypothetically dangerous

25
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,459
insulation does not come from the
zombies themself it comes from the other

26
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:54,540
people in a slow they're still be there
is instinctively drive and and you know

27
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,790
to watch for the large numbers large
quantities of them in in the groups but

28
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:08,060
the largest threat is from the other
people meaning you can have more orders

29
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:15,359
groups that wants to go to your group
and to take what you have or to pillage

30
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:19,859
and plunder everything that is around
there is no rules there are no laws and

31
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:26,220
you are probably going to be with
weapons dangerous so the first thing you

32
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,540
have to consider is how to protect
yourself your small group was up to kill

33
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:38,409
her family or small group of friends and
you want primarily to defend from the

34
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:46,078
other people also of course you have to
know the rules of the zombies and you

35
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:53,569
know the answer is also presented from
them but mainly from the other people so

36
00:03:53,569 --> 00:04:01,578
the people are the problem and we're
talking about the strategy here I don't

37
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:07,049
mean that by saying that it absorbs
something he does certainly but in this

38
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,270
way I want to mention one of the

39
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:18,350
curious things about the suspenders you
know if you put it through the city but

40
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:23,450
not your ordinary regular sitter from
the kitchen but it's actually going to

41
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,140
be a real threat of something like this

42
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:34,270
silk material separated to a single
cells and what happens then is very

43
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:34,840
interesting

44
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,429
all those things tend to gather together
and to bring back the sponsor again in

45
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,980
the format that it was so I

46
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:51,250
civilization is like that so we have a
sudden impact of something which

47
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,790
disrupted the civilization in entirety
meaning zombies and you know the stuff

48
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,080
to do everything communication
connection between people and everything

49
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,969
you know nothing works but just the
initial wave meaning that it has to

50
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:12,140
settle and then the civilizations going
to present itself is going to try to

51
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:18,890
assemble itself again so your best
strategy would be too many Kevin already

52
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:25,780
have a small group you should try to
conquer all of the other groups and to

53
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:31,440
make europe larger and larger as large
as possible you know and then bring your

54
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,510
old so-called blood see a doctor they
thrown those groups you're not no longer

55
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,900
at War II and you can start rebuilding
the government the civilization and that

56
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,620
the system again so that would happen

57
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:52,950
definitely so you know like this guy I'm
not even going to try to pronounce his

58
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:59,039
name but you know he founded the largest
empire that ever existed if you can't

59
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,660
land mass but it did that by conquering
small groups by another one by another

60
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,530
and in the end he created largest empire
largest them prominent part of the 10

61
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,270
imparted ever existed

62
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,340
other questions call to retain that and
how to govern that's a separate question

63
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,080
but that is what you want you want to be
like like him in the case of zombie

64
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:32,240
apocalypse so let's talk about in that
event of the zombie apocalypse or any

65
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:41,120
unforeseen event you want to hear
communication which is reliable that is

66
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,500
the top priority so you want to care for
example if you order a new groups like

67
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:56,670
if you make them like you care of your
troops viewer generals whatever you have

68
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,570
to control them and you can't to convey
the information about commands but they

69
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:08,700
have to do to them and this is actually
tactical operation tactical sorry

70
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,840
tactical communication meaning that you
have to be able to send the data to them

71
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,679
but let's consider for the theater of
the zombie apocalypse for this case just

72
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,220
to be there in europe not some small
regional something like that not entire

73
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,730
world problems going to happen in Cairo
but let's consider youre so you have to

74
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,690
communicate

75
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:38,620
large businesses meaning at least 1,000
kilometres more couple thousand

76
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,980
kilometres and you have to have a
reliable real communication of conveyor

77
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:49,640
orders to troops will do that for
operational communications of course if

78
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,979
you want to run was the best with
communication at all of course it is

79
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:00,849
shortwave radio 2 Way Radio talk about
key or do we call it also

80
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:05,748
if you want simplicity for example
tomorrow the guys from my comedy clubs

81
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:10,559
are going to be here we go to be a
little bit of a horse open you know just

82
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:14,669
retreating about anything that you want
to know about it we're going to bring

83
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:22,109
couple of radio stations and do the
digital come radio operation modes if

84
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,520
you want something simple you can't or
more Scott you know because you can

85
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,859
build transmitter for more cool Morse
code which can be heard

86
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,839
15 kilometres something like ten miles
away by just using five elements in 02

87
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:43,149
of resistors and resistor with general
purpose transistor and remember one

88
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:47,329
capacity or something like that so five
elements and you can be online you can

89
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:52,329
just meet you can call for help you can
scavenge for example if your plane

90
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:57,810
crashes you can skip those parts are
very commonly founded in any kind of

91
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:06,949
authority can make it through sleater so
but what today is not an operational

92
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:10,500
communications but on the tactical
communications meaning on the

93
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:20,089
communication for a long range so let's
talk about that automatically link

94
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:25,149
establishment automatically establishes
what it is and what it does is basically

95
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:31,029
started as a us- government and military
standard so it is you know it is open

96
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:35,759
you can read it you can implement your
own versions and I'm going to take this

97
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:42,490
opportunity because it's a lot of young
and smart people here so far software

98
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,939
for our government to talk about so
after a little bit later but only for

99
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:51,889
Windows operating system there is a
fortunately no implementation of four

100
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:57,130
leanings of our controller so 3
controller so if anybody's interested

101
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,329
you know everything is open you can read
the specification you can read

102
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:11,599
you can help you know always actually
something which American military and

103
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,259
government use their for example
separate implementation for a marine

104
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:23,579
corps' Marcella and what it does I know
how much you probably don't know about

105
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:32,429
radio waves you know how they travel the
problem with a jeffrey delays for high

106
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:38,980
frequency radio waves is that while they
cannot they can travel large distances

107
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:44,540
for example my local club here the
connection directly nor direct to a

108
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,309
connection

109
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:51,949
expedition on the South Pole director
election from some god forsaken city in

110
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:57,878
this region with the South Pole
expedition without any you know without

111
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:04,439
any relays without any anything in
between so it can go very very long

112
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:13,179
signals can travel in two ways so you
hear one component of the syllabus goes

113
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:20,959
almost straight line and is going to get
you probably some couple of Conduct

114
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,809
record kilometers but what is
interesting is the second component of

115
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:29,540
the HSE

116
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:37,389
actually goes toward the space and then
bounces off the youngster so it bounces

117
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:45,829
maybe a couple of times and it can reach
very very distant lands so easily

118
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:51,449
the problem with this is that it is very
unstable meaning that it is not like a

119
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:56,269
telephone you know it depends so many
things and this is what makes a good

120
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:00,709
home radio operator you know you have to
know all these things to be able to

121
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:04,279
switch for example the frequencies for
example some of the frequencies that do

122
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:10,569
not work at night or some of the free
classes for example 21 murders is very

123
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:16,429
dependent on the solar flares so when
you hear a large number of spots every

124
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:21,689
11 30 years you have a solar maximum and
then you can talk with Japan using 21

125
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:27,439
murder hurts like you're talking with my
phone is very very good quality is high

126
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:32,939
but when it starts decreasing then you
cannot do anything you cannot hear you

127
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:37,919
just pack your antenna for twenty-five
medical school next 11 years and

128
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,699
remember you could always the problem
the american government wanted to solve

129
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:51,868
is they didn't want to have highly
skilled operators to depend on them they

130
00:12:51,869 --> 00:13:01,019
wanted to just the media operators and
to empower them to use HFE no reliable

131
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:06,269
Mandir so if you don't have a reliable
communication however you can you can

132
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:09,649
communicate over large distances but if
you can do it

133
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:17,449
reliable than it is so so we're going to
talk a little bit more about how it

134
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:28,160
solves that the terms but you can of
course be there is we can operate by

135
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,999
voice or text messages or even you know
you hear something which is called pilot

136
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:39,610
stations which you install some BBS
author and then you can leave messages

137
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:45,739
for somebody else who use the station
for example nice nice application of

138
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:54,789
alan was in Sandy's storm and one of the
when everything goes down you know

139
00:13:54,789 --> 00:14:01,869
civilization of fragile very fragile so
when something unforeseen happens on a

140
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:04,649
large scale you're going to lose your
fault you're going to lose your

141
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:09,100
connectivity interest in going to lose
everything that you take for granted and

142
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:16,199
what is left is this you know you can
take your stay connected to the car

143
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:21,609
battery and operated straightaway you
can move it you can do whatever you can

144
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:33,049
to communications so yes I'm not going
to go too deep into the tools there is

145
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:38,049
no time for that but as I say you're
smart people and they're plenty of

146
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:43,379
information about this just to notify
you that this exists if you don't know

147
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:48,759
you know it's interesting thing it is
usable and it has a community which

148
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:55,569
growth meaning in seven years ago there
was a network of global our network is

149
00:14:55,569 --> 00:15:01,939
called a href link it if the target
thing but i think in the end of the

150
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:10,490
presentation so let's talk about how it
works you have a couple of antennas for

151
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:17,369
example of per device for example for
714 three and a half and 21 mayor and

152
00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:27,189
the other guy also couple of an illness
and what happens is the software and the

153
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:32,099
hardware devices for its cold out of
control or if you have a softer

154
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:38,669
controller it is embedded in the station
itself those very expensive for us from

155
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:43,749
radio operators prices went down but
still there are not too you know

156
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:49,029
available usually the government or the
military use them and then you don't

157
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:52,769
have to worry or you can use and what it
does is this

158
00:15:52,769 --> 00:16:00,720
periodically your station scans all of
the available frequencies and just

159
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,899
leases if there for example I have to
mention this first all of the radio

160
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:15,040
operators have their cool science my
from textfree and my oldest patient with

161
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:23,269
Michael sign over the same day as my
station in everyone who wants to contact

162
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:27,559
their thing and it works like this

163
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:35,799
my station for example and if for
example your status which could be

164
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:43,549
killed on 9 November November what it's
just going to remember the frequencies

165
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:49,279
it was first for example you tell us 43
is going to record in a local database

166
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:59,660
ok I heard that station on three makers
the nice to see this error issue and I'm

167
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,379
going to determine that was the best
channel to communicate with you just

168
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:09,419
remember that and just cancel every 10
seconds something like that it does make

169
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:17,020
contact yet he just makes the basal you
know who is around here and when you

170
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,349
want to call the other station goes like
this for example she wants to call my

171
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,279
radio station just centers

172
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:34,840
specific types of my callsign side of
the radio station if her computer

173
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,168
connected to the registration and
connected via the soundcard basically

174
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:45,130
and then she talks in michael c what
happens next

175
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:56,900
of radio ways and actually going to call
my name my station still scarce

176
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:05,120
all non-free Chris's and sees the first
two letters from my callsign and then it

177
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:13,919
stops Kenny and then all of the other
letters are like mark Michael side and

178
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:23,340
is going to know that some stations ok
let me stop and then is going to because

179
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,399
that her station is going to sound is
called sounding when you win the trust

180
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,200
me so it's going to sound her call
saying also and the stages are going to

181
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,280
automatically do the handshake protocol
established in either operator

182
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:46,160
even Beshear is going to building and
she can send me message for example

183
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,420
there is a disaster situation and they
have to fight with my crossbow actually

184
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:57,790
do have a couple of both but not the
crucible and violent fighting them that

185
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,879
message is here with me for me and I
come back I can read it so the stations

186
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,010
are linked and in the end of the
communication when she wants to

187
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:13,560
terminate that link that communications
and all she has is that so it is not

188
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,520
automatically sending out the former
something you have to click on certain

189
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:24,639
but so my station is free again for the
other station but it's interesting here

190
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,840
is for example shit is intense I have
three intense for different free classes

191
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:37,100
and what happens if for example 3 makers
goes down it is very bad reputation for

192
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,139
teenagers to the given time
automatically our system is going to you

193
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:48,260
know always assess the quality of doing
is going to say ok this is not good

194
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:56,360
letters disconnect from this dream a
first and let us connect that works that

195
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,399
episode so I don't have to worry about
you know

196
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:03,820
communications sustaining the connection
that's very important because when

197
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,299
you're doing that LIKE operator manually

198
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:14,309
you know you always have to agree with
let's go on other cured Ryu other

199
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:19,519
frequency let's let's let's schedule you
know this for you don't have to worry

200
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:31,239
about that at all so this allows
operators to do much more things much

201
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:37,719
more we could you know just manually
this just makes us better meaning that

202
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:43,289
we can single operator can handle
multiple networks because you can also

203
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:50,559
make using our that's very important
because of a massive network you have

204
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,399
announced and every node can speak to
each other in if I don't see him for

205
00:20:56,399 --> 00:21:05,629
example through this you know it's very
reserved

206
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:12,369
resultant rhetoric so it is very usable
in emergency situation and it is used in

207
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:19,939
emergency situation but this is how it
works and this short diagram showing you

208
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:27,460
know that you can hear a mobile station
UK stationary station or whatever they

209
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:35,659
are they all are equal but there are
some of the specific station that they

210
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:40,809
mentioned already called the pilot
station they have a specific software

211
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:43,879
install of them on them

212
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:51,349
which station there are available 24 7
all around the year so you can use them

213
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:56,599
like you know like you would use any
other node but you can also use them as

214
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:02,289
a relay race or whatever or the usually
something which is called BBS link

215
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:07,899
software installed on them so you can
you know you can connect SMS messaging

216
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:12,439
to them you can send emails by pilot
station even if you don't have the

217
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:19,099
activity you can say for example jungle
whatever you need to email for whatever

218
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:24,689
reason and you can do that you can
actually send the information to the

219
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:31,429
palace station is going to transfer
emails to whoever it has to be just

220
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:37,199
regular email is not nothing special
just SMTP errors sending something of

221
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:40,419
course if used that you cannot use it
for spam

222
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:45,869
is going to be too slow and the other
thing is you cannot use it for

223
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:48,119
commercial purposes

224
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:53,789
there is something which is called
products for example of you cannot there

225
00:22:53,789 --> 00:23:01,749
is very interesting presentation from
think it is connected to some digital

226
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:08,579
modes of communication for home radio
and he's actually just be there it is

227
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:14,219
interesting but what I wanted to tell to
you is that think about that

228
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:20,409
products which says you're not allowed
to communicate in cryptography

229
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:27,019
everything is a plain text and we cannot
encrypt everything so this is the

230
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:31,450
context of course in the case of zombie
apocalypse

231
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:43,260
probably bend the rules a little bit ok
so yes this hardware for so is it reads

232
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:51,490
the most of the radio operators use this
PCR assaulter and it is coupled with the

233
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,700
SSB transceiver

234
00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:00,409
by the sound card meaning the only
interface is you know output input just

235
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:07,159
sound waves and you connect the mic to
the 22 computer and you connect the

236
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:13,000
output of the station to computer and
recording and codes and related to it of

237
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,950
course it helps if you have a computer
could get the beach is something which

238
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:23,549
controls automatically station you know
you can buy click on the button on the

239
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:30,980
softer that's usually how it works so
here and we which is if you look at

240
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:38,000
either of the heaviest rain suit for it
it looks very old dated it is in terms

241
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,929
of you know but this multi PSK is even
worse you know you you came as House of

242
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:56,899
controls and it's very it scales so yes
there are commercial HOF radios Ali

243
00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:03,110
controller already built in it so you
can buy those they're not that expensive

244
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:09,799
as there are you just started maybe ten
years ago so you don't need to hear the

245
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:16,899
computer if you have those but you do
like I know one point five thousand

246
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:23,159
dollars something like that so for
example

247
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:34,690
one of them those stations i cum 7,000
which is it is I don't think solving in

248
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:39,670
this case but this waterproof cases
ideal for a case of zombie apocalypse

249
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,990
you know you hear you hear of the
display only thing you hear them

250
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:48,480
keyboard where you can type in the
messages don't need to have the you know

251
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,920
the computer it is not there so with
this station but of course computer did

252
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,560
so much more freedom and much more
things you can do with it

253
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:04,940
meaning you can send files for example
during the storm actually one of the

254
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:12,140
operators communicated across 19 states
with with the families of the people who

255
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:17,220
are trapped and you know send the list
of the people who are missing or found

256
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:24,240
in the truth that was the only
communication in the United States

257
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,660
shared for maybe they'll to something
like that and all that is required is

258
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,670
something like this

259
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:41,770
a little bit of fire maybe I know maybe
twenty metres but it can be anywhere and

260
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:50,590
you just throw it out the window and
you're good to go to go so just some

261
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:57,810
agreed frequency going to that much but
just wanted to show that their

262
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:07,690
agreements on you know you can operate
what you can do and that is also agreed

263
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:18,169
with the International through unions
you know all sorted out

264
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:33,639
so this description of our stations are
communicating between there and let us

265
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:40,408
mention this is maybe the most important
link for our communication it is a chick

266
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:46,710
flick dot com which represents the
highest reconciling the organization of

267
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:54,220
all the people using away so it is a
chip network it is I think in USA here's

268
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:01,309
some maybe fifty to seventy stations in
the region here we do have our network

269
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:09,720
creation for example in here for some
reason they are not too keen they did

270
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:16,019
not see the value in there but you know
the neighbors European users so we do

271
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:26,470
have always station our power station I
think another city he's going to make

272
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,549
power station very soon we thought that
we're going to make it in time for this

273
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:35,590
conference but not yet what's going to
be operational very solid is going to be

274
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:42,428
on 10 megahertz and you're welcome to
join in too to see somebody is

275
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:50,249
interesting from radio is open for
everybody and just to end up going back

276
00:28:50,249 --> 00:28:54,499
to what they promise to you you know
what's the connection between packing

277
00:28:54,499 --> 00:29:00,669
thinking in the ham radio and a little
bit more over history of going going to

278
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:02,260
take too long you know

279
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:11,590
well on both sides so lets a subculture
subculture subculture

280
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:18,959
intelligent people which are driven by
the first thing and on the both sides

281
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,820
have people who are trying to excel and
trying to extend assistance that they

282
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:30,590
use to make it better to find novel ways
of communication you're very interesting

283
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:38,570
Communication Workers also interesting
application there is I think / broadband

284
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:45,550
there is in dire broadband network of
ham radio station connected to Reuters

285
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:51,970
United States and Europe I'm not sure
but they are in the United States there

286
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:57,060
is a network of station since meeting
everything over the IP protocols

287
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:06,649
everything like it should you know just
using the radio stations and so people

288
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:11,060
who are experimenting who like mystery
for example may be of some of your

289
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:15,659
current for a number of stations that
something which is not cracked yet you

290
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:24,290
know there they started cold war-era you
head soviet you hear the German and this

291
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:35,980
is a test third but if you ask for
details just say something and

292
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:43,010
moderators what they do is that certain
fratricide certain time over there they

293
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:48,980
trust me some of those those are voiced
some of those using Morse code and they

294
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:59,980
do something like this in 0533 2011 stop
maybe 3 33 trust of those and his goals

295
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,620
Lions until tomorrow the other bedroom
number of years nobody knows what they

296
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:12,409
are you know so there is a mystery there
is a passion for technology for you know

297
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:20,250
of course we're not most of us rich
people and we have to you know do with

298
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:27,870
what we have so here you can make your
own just trying to cut the costs you can

299
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:36,070
make your own and tell us what is good
is that it is interchangeable can be

300
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:41,370
crossed with all of the other so for
example of a computer scientist and

301
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:46,669
author programmers who are some radio
operators and they also help you know

302
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:54,810
this is all so interconnected with the
debt and just going to end with a little

303
00:31:54,810 --> 00:32:07,110
bit of history just bear with me so what
happened is that you know how it became

304
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:15,120
to be there to stories like a bandit I
don't like that much and one that I like

305
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:23,399
is it just the first time radio
operators build their stations and they

306
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,960
just the first thing that they found
that was boxer who come which was

307
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,020
usually

308
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:38,760
box at the times there's the first and
probably unlikely scenario and more

309
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:46,200
scenario is that a regional telegraph
operators which were fired

310
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,230
telegraphy

311
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:51,630
just for you know a little bit
professional and the they head towards

312
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:56,390
the violence operators and they said
those guys did they don't even know

313
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:04,429
about it called correctly they have a
chance they're good coordination that is

314
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:12,860
the name radio and to end this also
connected one development of a

315
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:19,260
disconnect one of the greatest tragedies
in the world which is sinking of Titanic

316
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:25,700
after the nineteen well before that you
could do whatever you want on the

317
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,559
Terrebonne the 2012 can use whatever
after that

318
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:37,168
this is going to be a problem people
started to interfere with the

319
00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:42,379
transmission of the other boats of the
government systems everything so they

320
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:49,418
wanted to know to put the radio matters
aside so they said okay you can use

321
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:58,259
whatever free courtesy of wavelength 200
metres or less which was considered you

322
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:04,269
know so they're just going to play and
what happened is that because of him

323
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:08,239
radio movement exploration of debt

324
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:18,209
part of the radio spectrum I would like
to think is speeded up and save fifty

325
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:25,460
years of research in that field because
we do have three million people and who

326
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:30,699
knows maybe some of you will join the
board thank you guys

327
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:36,750
any question with us tomorrow villages
be there with the stations and you're

328
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:42,079
free to work with us to you cannot but
you can see how it goes

329
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,179
all right thank you

330
00:34:47,179 --> 00:35:06,780
my my first question this seems very end
to end you're talking to one of the

331
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:16,720
stations is there a routing and if not
my other question is what happened to

332
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:25,009
packet radio I mean operated by using a
packet radio a twenty-five years to

333
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:31,720
build communication networks including
routing what happened to them so I can

334
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:39,970
still alive and kicking so people are
using it but the last couple of years is

335
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:49,129
something which is called 3131 both
speed and BPSK for phase shifting K

336
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:55,160
you have interesting lecture about that
actually in the sense that they said

337
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:03,720
about the god speed so yes packet radio
is not that much about the routing

338
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:11,379
chretien those pilots stations are
something like a Reuters for the network

339
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,089
so they actually build a network so it
is

340
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:24,099
point-to-point but you can also route
information by those files stations so

341
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:32,690
this is my best knowledge of course not
work that much but we are just starting

342
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,849
with our club to use that I hope

343
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:54,849
at least a little bit of information
that is so how can I become operator in

344
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:56,319
the city

345
00:36:56,319 --> 00:37:06,920
you're from sorry from the side pocket
so there is a travel partner Rebecca I

346
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:14,029
think it's called club you know that
restaurant just you know there you know

347
00:37:14,029 --> 00:37:20,999
it is there's so I think they're close
to that I'm not in that club but you can

348
00:37:20,999 --> 00:37:26,009
go and talk to the people I'm going to
connect with later on early stage just

349
00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:36,349
for a moment you just go there and then
there is some basic you know that you

350
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:41,890
prepare and then when you pass the test
you become a licensed ham radio operator

351
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:46,598
before that you can also enjoy the hobby
meaning you can listen to the broadcast

352
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:52,619
but you don't have the license to
broadcast yourself so there are some

353
00:37:52,619 --> 00:38:01,029
radio clubs in almost every city a
member of the pop overages Training Club

354
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:05,499
I'm not member of this club so I don't
know where they're exactly but I'm going

355
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:14,368
to make inquiries so please by jay-c
uniforms for school Papa deltacom you

356
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:19,400
should have any from issues become a
member of our club it is not connected

357
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:25,269
to the city you can be member of
multiple clubs so it is just going talk

358
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:34,649
to the people and make friends make new
you know point of use anymore sorry yes

359
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:48,480
way to communicate during disasters
maybe description is not directly right

360
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:58,230
radio but in the example seal what did
they use for power source yes yes of

361
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:08,800
course you can use your hand it some of
the stations are very you know you can

362
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:15,670
vary for example did I mention you're
going to build tomorrow that just may 24

363
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:23,100
Morris called it can take anything from
one and a half battery to maybe 12 walls

364
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:30,250
but through something like this I hear
station which I connect to the car

365
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:35,340
battery so you can use care about the
actual did that you know just connected

366
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:45,500
to the led to Quran and there is also
some movement inside of the moment is

367
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:52,280
called cure P which is master of our
commitment so meaning I'm not going to

368
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:59,240
do one killer to power because you know
I can I'm going to try to use as little

369
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:04,990
as possible cure appeals five months or
less so with with five votes

370
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:11,799
all of the European tell us what's up
with this and all of the digital most

371
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:18,310
use usually about 20 to 30 per hour and
20 volts of power we communicated in

372
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:34,380
Japan you know light bulb there are no
lie anymore

373
00:40:34,380 --> 00:41:10,400
to because
