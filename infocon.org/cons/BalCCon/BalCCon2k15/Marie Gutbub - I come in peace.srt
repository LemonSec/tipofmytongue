1
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:26,990
hello over it I think this is all and
thats lecture will be from Marian good

2
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:33,699
book from the name i cum and piss and
lets sheilas hear what she has to say

3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,760
about it

4
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:46,150
one big applause for her and her
attacker's face I was wearing a pink

5
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:51,489
really long skirt with glitter I didn't
plan to go to hackers based on that

6
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:56,078
night but some are kind of forced me
because he said it was a shame that I

7
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,820
hadn't been there yet when I entered the
hackerspace looked amazing there were

8
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:08,500
all these lights blinking object these
weird things and devices there was music

9
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,680
and there was a bunch of really drunk
white men in the middle of the room I

10
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:27,590
thought to give me a tour of the space
around the workshops or the devices and

11
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,690
the members area which is probably the
most amazing room in the world for me

12
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:37,000
when i saw this room is pretty sure I
want to stay here I want to use this

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,250
room to work I wanna hang out there was
a dark room with lots of really small

14
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,110
LEDs everywhere

15
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:50,520
parts of computers on the walls and lots
of stickers I decided

16
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,460
I want to be a member of the space the
guy who gave me the tour took me to his

17
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,169
workshop with the group of people who
had a tour and these people we're almost

18
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,380
all men there was one other girl but I
think someone's girlfriend so she was

19
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,769
not really interesting for the guy who
gave me the tour and he started to talk

20
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:16,970
to me only to me kind of ignoring the
rest of the group and he talked to me a

21
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,569
lot and I was really curious asking a
lot of questions and how could have

22
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:24,849
become a member for example but at some
point I felt like I was a little bit

23
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:29,390
creepy that he would just like to talk
to me look at me all the time so I

24
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:35,069
decided to go back find my friend and I
didn't find them so I was left alone in

25
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:41,480
that space with all these drunk guys I
went to the bar and at the bar there was

26
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,298
this other guy was like kind of weird
guy with a really intense look and he

27
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:52,040
was leaning on the bar with one shoulder
and when our drinks you just raised his

28
00:02:52,040 --> 00:03:00,819
glass me and said so how do to women
have sex together I was like what why

29
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:04,819
would you ask me this I'm not I'm not
even looking like a lesbian I have like

30
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:09,230
this occurred with all this glittering
looking super girly what's on your mind

31
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,230
why are you doing this and you explain
me well you like lesbian and there's not

32
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,340
a lot of women here so we thought he
asked me and started trolling him not

33
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:25,340
because what else could I do and I asked
him about two men having sex he said no

34
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,500
no I'm conservative but this is not good
but I like watching lesbians having sex

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,109
so please explain to me your woman you
probably know how to do that at that

36
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:39,560
point the first guy the one who gave me
the tour the creepy one just a few

37
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,430
metres away from us and he was like kind
of watching us but not approaching us

38
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,910
now felt there was really where it's
like was sticking to the lesbian friend

39
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,380
because he looked less creepy even if
what he was doing was quite creeps to

40
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,680
actually and when the lessons and left

41
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,260
to get another beer because obviously
wasn't drunk enough the first guy came

42
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:10,858
back to me sat next to me and said now
it's my turn I left the place and I

43
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:15,629
thought a lot I didn't know what to do
because I really wanted to become a

44
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:20,259
member I really wanted to stay in this
place I wanted to use it I wanted to be

45
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:24,880
part of it I wanted to work with these
people but also I didn't want to accept

46
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,659
this behavior I didn't feel like I could
deal with that on a daily basis so I've

47
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,830
heard a lot and I decided that I'm going
back because I have the right to use

48
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,099
this faith even if if I'ma woman and I
had done nothing wrong

49
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:46,620
the person who did something wrong we're
obviously these two guys should I punish

50
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:53,900
myself for being a woman so I decided to
be one of these persons who stay in the

51
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,609
hackers face even if they're not totally
welcome for some people and who may be

52
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:06,820
will change things at some point because
they stayed when I tell this story

53
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,240
some people say yes it's an exception
these guys were drunk and you just had

54
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:19,199
bad luck but then why do such things
happen so often last year I went to

55
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,389
Bulgaria to give free workshops on
encryption into her spaces in the first

56
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,740
hackerspace ahead an amazing experience
really respectful in the tech space

57
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:37,180
everything went wrong first before I
even arrived people ask his girlfriend I

58
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:43,180
was because obviously three guys and a
woman traveling to teach and corruption

59
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,870
that can't be four people teaching and
corruption that's three guys teaching

60
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:52,759
encryption and some government hanging
out around with them when I arrived

61
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:58,090
there was started organizing the
workshop and they simply didn't listen

62
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:03,820
to me it was really obvious and I'm not
the person we noticed that the guys who

63
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,219
are traveling with me noticed that first
I left

64
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,770
the party organisation part I thought I
just helped the workshop another

65
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:18,340
workshop I think fifty percent of women
entered songs like this is actually good

66
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,669
maybe some guys in the space are not
okay but people are coming and women are

67
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:29,710
coming so we teach women and then I
noticed that no woman had brought a

68
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,780
computer men came with their computers
to learn encryption and they brought

69
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,789
their girlfriends were supposed to wait
there so I spend the whole workshop

70
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:43,250
talking with the girlfriends trying to
explain them encryption and why they

71
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,170
should do it too

72
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:49,140
why it's not only for the hecker by
friends I'm not the only one who has

73
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,469
experienced such things

74
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:59,520
another workshop a woman came in she was
really tiny woman and she taught herself

75
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,520
email encryption encryption and are
alone in a room she had even read the

76
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,990
crypto party Handbook which I as a trip
to our party organizer haven't done she

77
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:16,640
was really amazing and we convince her
that she had the rights to teach too so

78
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,620
I saw her she was mastering the art of
teaching PDP to a bunch of men who are

79
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:28,410
respectfully listening to her everything
looked great until one man entered the

80
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,070
room he arrived too late and just
decided oh here there's a table that's

81
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:37,479
led by women that's not OK and you took
over the table and later he told me he

82
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:43,880
saved the table because she was not able
to explain encryption how can we expect

83
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:50,560
women to join the tech scene if this is
their first experience to go back to my

84
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,100
hunger space experience when I decided
to be to refuse to be one of these women

85
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,479
who want to be part of the scene but
feel like it's not a place for them

86
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,820
because they're women when I decided to
be there every day

87
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:10,040
became normal at some point but I could
still noticed differences for example I

88
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,750
really like playing with clothes like
one day outlook may be a really girly

89
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,080
and the other day I have friends and I
couldn't notice

90
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,680
how the guys would react differently to
me for example if I come wearing leather

91
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,860
starts when I entered this kind of work
when I entered and like 10 guys doing

92
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,979
that makes a lot of nice weather when I
just come like this that like hi how are

93
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:45,670
you doing what are you working on it
later that there's a big debate about me

94
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:53,490
at this hackerspace lesbian or not
because if I wear this but on the next

95
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:59,589
day I wear a mini skirt I'm not so I
don't stick to their roles and I'm

96
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:03,260
supposed to stick to one of them so they
know if they can flirt with me or not

97
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,890
because there's not a lot of women and
hackers faith so they should know

98
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:14,790
noticed that people act differently
around you based on your clothes if

99
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:21,149
you're barely the conversation level
would be less technical for example the

100
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:28,110
day I became a member I got my password
and then they show me how to plug in the

101
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,050
internet there because they have a
special network and how they showed to

102
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:37,630
me was like oh so there is some kind of
certificate thing you should have it to

103
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:43,740
log in but try without it just type in
your password and we'll see and it

104
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:52,640
worked so they're like hahaha computer
that works without CI cert amazing and a

105
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,640
few weeks later I helped a male friend
of mine to become a member and he

106
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,310
doesn't particularly look like he's a
nerd is also a really young but they

107
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,229
started talking to him like this so
there is a CA SERT they should download

108
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,810
it from there and we know how to do that
and blah blah blah explaining everything

109
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:18,290
and then let him do it alone that's the
difference between men and women how

110
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:23,410
you're treated there is another thing
that's really interesting as a woman is

111
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,620
when you give a talk I've been playing
with clothes a lot and i notice

112
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:34,300
the different behaviors I started
wondering I'm going to be taken

113
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,640
seriously if I haven't talked in a
miniskirt or maybe I just need to dress

114
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,000
like a nerd like I'm part of it

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,930
friends mostly encouraged me to come
with pants because they want me to be

116
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,760
taken seriously I'm not sure this is the
right thing to do I'm not sure because

117
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,439
this really matter when I'm on stage I
want people to take me seriously as a

118
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,820
human being because I have something to
say and you can hate what I say if you

119
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:09,380
want but not my gender the way I dress
shouldn't have any influence on your

120
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:18,300
opinion on me I guess rationally a lot
of you probably agree but we do have

121
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:39,680
taken me seriously if I would come up on
stage dressed like this

122
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,130
imagine a woman coming to do until a dog
and take on this would you honestly

123
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:52,430
think you should we do you have listened
to the stories I told you in the same

124
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:57,160
way about the guys talking to me if I
would have shown up like this or would

125
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,449
you have said she was looking for it
would you ask questions about about

126
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:09,750
encryption tools and where is this I
have not been part of this scene for a

127
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:14,890
very long time less than two years my
technical skills are not the best I

128
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:21,449
can't program but I don't want to hear
that this is okay when the same people

129
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,649
who say this is OK

130
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:28,279
make jokes about their male friends who
can program I don't want people to

131
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:35,709
expect less from me because I'm a woman
I want a really stupid thing I was

132
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:41,810
really tired and I played around with
gparted and I can offer raised my main

133
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:47,979
encrypted partition I had a backup it
was not a big problem the only thing I

134
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:53,850
lost was the state filed for an
encryption a communication software

135
00:12:53,850 --> 00:13:00,610
called pond you can't restore that
because the keys keep changing and I

136
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:05,180
don't have to tell my friends I had lost
their contact and I told that to one guy

137
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:11,329
who is using parking lots and I told him
why and how I'd lost it and you looked

138
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:16,320
at me and he said oh my god you're the
first woman who could explain this to me

139
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:24,370
this company month i dont wanted there
is no Dec four men and four women I want

140
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,750
people to expect me to know as much as
they do and if I don't understand

141
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,579
something it is because I studied
journalism and language and literature

142
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:38,109
and not computer science not because of
women and that is not written on my

143
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:45,060
faith are you going to say but your talk
is called I come in peace and now you're

144
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,739
just accusing us again

145
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:56,149
I do come in peace I don't want war with
men and i know im not saying all men and

146
00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:00,990
I don't think aggressive attacks from
some feminist groups towards men will

147
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:08,970
make things better I have a friend who
writes a new social media that wouldn't

148
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:15,310
sell that he wrote a manifesto about it
and the big part of the bullshit he gets

149
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:20,020
on Twitter is for not having included a
statement that he supports women then

150
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:27,160
queer people in his manifesto about tech
this is not okay there is a necessity to

151
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,649
acknowledge the problem I described to
you before but we don't need to attack

152
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:36,620
people when we don't know if they're
doing something wrong

153
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:43,020
not I once participated in something
that you might have seen on Twitter

154
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:50,529
there was this picture there were 80
photos of men white men during an

155
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:56,700
assault Jacob Appelbaum barrett Brown
Chelsea Manning as Bradley and in the

156
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,870
middle of there was written courage is
contagious and I participated in

157
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:06,630
something that my friend genuine York
started she asked me to replace these

158
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:14,470
eight pictures of men with a pictures of
women with different skin colors I

159
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:22,579
agreed because it made sense to show
that these were on the men but now I

160
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:26,959
think this is wrong and I'm really sorry
for doing that I think that we shouldn't

161
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:32,119
have replaced the pictures we should
have added them and make them because

162
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,120
her thinker edge has many faces with
which replaced courage is contagious

163
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,329
has meant faith as well the only
pictures picture I would actually have

164
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:47,109
arise from a man is Bradley Manning's
picture that I would have replaced with

165
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:52,709
such as many picture because that was
really wrong has many faces and white

166
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:55,270
men are part of it too

167
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,410
hi guys

168
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:03,800
I come in peace if you acknowledge the
problems they described earlier I come

169
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:11,229
in peace if you are on an equal basis
I'd rather work with you then against

170
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:19,410
you we have enough problems in off other
problems to solve let's not fight it is

171
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:27,399
necessary to say that hackers space that
her space people can be not ok to women

172
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:35,529
when I rode an article about women in
tech for a major German newspaper I was

173
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:38,910
writing that in a hackerspace and the
guys off me what are you writing on

174
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,199
about us

175
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,370
obviously wearing baggy pants because
they wouldn't have asked me if I was

176
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:48,100
wearing a mini-skirt and some other guys
got really scared when I said I'm

177
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,199
writing about women in tech because
these guys had been attacked so often as

178
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,219
a hackerspace space has been at that so
many times because of drawings on the

179
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,880
walls because of whatever that they're
scared and then they become aggressive

180
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:11,510
because sometimes we women are the one
who are aggressive I want organized an

181
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:16,929
encryption workshop for women I normally
don't do that I hated I think we

182
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:21,600
shouldn't never never separate woman
from men four men in tech let's work

183
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,750
together a wide and also maybe 12
journalists woman who wanted to learn

184
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:33,120
encryption and they got this location
there was a woman spar and a guy

185
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,678
organized a workshop with me so we
thought they knew some guys will come

186
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:42,350
when the first guy entered the place he
was kicked out he was shot it up in a

187
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:47,889
really aggressive way by women even if
he was there to empower women by trying

188
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:54,860
to help them to use encryption teach
them something this is as wrong as the

189
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:00,969
aggressivity from mentors woman has as a
woman I can tell you

190
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:07,320
at being in the tech scene is not always
some things really need to change and

191
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,600
these changes will not be accomplished
through water what we need is an

192
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,399
in-depth social social change a change
on which we all need to work together

193
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,299
and change that needs and deserves it
farther from us all to be accomplished

194
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:26,780
and this change I can already see it
happening because the first story of my

195
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:33,389
first day in the hackerspace that I told
you is not as bad as the songs these

196
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,020
guys are two guys when I told the other
guys this story

197
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:41,730
most of them reacted in a really good
way one of them told me he had been

198
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,309
watching me all the times when I was
with these guys and you thought I was

199
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:50,070
doing really well so I was just watching
in case something bad happens he would

200
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,770
have protected me but he felt like
seeing me trolling these guys was better

201
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:02,580
than defending me like I would need help
other guys just told me please inform us

202
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,730
when something happens we want to know
and if ever ever something happens like

203
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,320
this again

204
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:18,990
well do something about it just inform
us I have also noticed how relieved some

205
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:24,320
men are but I didn't hate them because
of what their friends did the program in

206
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,870
the Texan is not all men the program in
the text is a few men and feminists

207
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:33,600
should understand that I have been
working in the last month with amazing

208
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,809
men understood better than anyone else

209
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:42,418
the need for women to be revisited
visible part of the text for example I

210
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:47,380
worked on this nets politics thing the
case were two journalists have been

211
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:55,429
accused of high treason in Germany and
we're about to be judged for that and I

212
00:19:55,429 --> 00:20:00,770
set up a campaign for that with the man
was reef a mass and he made sure my name

213
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:06,900
is written always first because he
wanted it to look like the campaign is

214
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,660
led by a woman he also refused me to get
other men engaged in our group

215
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:18,960
because he didn't want the male
dominated group another guy I've been

216
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,880
working with for security trainings with
a professional stalker at conference

217
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:31,170
speaker at conferences are friendly to
give up talks so I just went on stage

218
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:38,280
because he wanted women to teach
encryption and security two men these

219
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,170
are men I love to work with and I'm
pretty sure that there are no exception

220
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:49,160
I hope they're not because this kind of
caliber collaborations as human beings

221
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:56,220
and others male or female is how we will
be able to change things people I come

222
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,810
in peace

223
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:07,740
let's work together thank you

224
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:14,360
I don't know if you want to do so

225
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,850
women were in the room to join an answer
with me if you want or if anyone wants

226
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:27,389
to share a story I'm not the only few my
experience in that room and you want a

227
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:52,080
woman if you have questions I can enter

228
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,750
thank you

229
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,090
there too

230
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:07,510
would go high-tech industry classroom
lesson what are your thoughts about it

231
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,480
if classroom boardwalk sorry I've just

232
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:18,860
classroom would you for example you
don't hear much met on tables something

233
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:34,570
like that if there would be less I don't
like if there would be less classroom

234
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:46,889
example less geeky stuff either comics
something like some study I think there

235
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:52,760
is a real need to change education but
more about adding computer science for

236
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,280
everyone and then it's the source social
change where women shouldn't hear when

237
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,940
they want to study computer science
which happened to friends of me that

238
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,020
they just heard no no that's from N Go
study something else for example history

239
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,660
or literature i think is more about that
