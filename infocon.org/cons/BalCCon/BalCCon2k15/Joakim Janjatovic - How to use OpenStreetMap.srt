1
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:28,849
so my name is your which will tell you
something about the opposite map so I'd

2
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:41,040
like to know how many of you have heard
about it and how many have used that ok

3
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:49,540
so I'll skip this part and I'll quickly
just run for it so it's open free world

4
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:56,059
map its licensed under open their biz
license and everyone is allowed to do

5
00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:03,369
anything with it as long as you respect
the community and put the sign at the

6
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:10,000
bottom of your display or the picture
that displays the data from this

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,540
Community its roots say that copyright
belongs to OpenStreetMap contributors

8
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:23,439
why would anyone use OpenStreetMap
because of legal or technical

9
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:32,179
restrictions or the lack of them because
any organization any government anyone

10
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:38,810
can use it without paying any licenses
without renewing them or having to

11
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:46,670
respect any other clauses that following
the licenses second reason or it will

12
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,940
actually be the first one is that it's
crowdsourced so it's always up to date

13
00:01:51,940 --> 00:02:00,240
and it doesn't rely on you individuals
to keep the databases running

14
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,470
some real-world examples of give you
some and i'd like to ask you if you have

15
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:16,380
seen them not on phones or tablets or
any kind of devices but public buildings

16
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:45,450
railway stations has anyone seen that
yeah so this is one example would say

17
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:56,518
that this is actually the future maps
are some individual used to draw the

18
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,080
maps themselves and

19
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:06,150
displayed those maps or copy them
individually that's behind us and we are

20
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:14,630
moving into this you world of open data
so this is one example I think it's a

21
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:22,530
railway station because it has a small
sign over here this is such a ban so

22
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:29,750
they use it in public buildings because
why would they paralyzes for something

23
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:37,730
they can use for free and many railway
station many bus stations and it would

24
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:44,350
be ridiculous to pay that large amount
of money for something that is not

25
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:53,620
better than this this is the second
example of commercial triumph I'm not

26
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:00,160
sure where is this but this time goes to
Victoria Park somewhere in the world

27
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:07,170
the point is that this car dealership is
promoting themselves and saying you can

28
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:14,089
buy this car over here and there doesn't
get map that comes from OpenStreetMap

29
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:25,880
database so this is this year when I
held the previous presentation so you

30
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:33,100
can see it's pretty detailed from this
point of view and here you can see it

31
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:43,009
from september or yesterday you consider
the grass is growing

32
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:58,979
and this road over here is also green I
don't know exactly how do they updated

33
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:06,449
so that road is actually burn motorway
and it has some different restrictions

34
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:13,300
than normal roads in the city so someone
in the meantime text that around the map

35
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:41,070
and now it's available for anyone to to
see this one

36
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:59,240
so this is not as the city centre the
whole city has data house numbers and

37
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:08,970
many local shops and any kind of
interesting places to be made the

38
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:18,320
difference with the current version is
that peace signs for example for

39
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,330
bookstores are different

40
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:32,270
they've updated version of software they
use on servers to display maps and many

41
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:37,430
other things like minor things have
improved which means that the system is

42
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:43,920
constantly proving it does not rely on a
single person to keep track of

43
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:56,150
everything its community-based this is
now this is a different kind of layer

44
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:04,710
that you can see it shows these lines
that are present site of terrain here it

45
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:12,049
says 150 and here it says hundred and
their four lines in between so that you

46
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:21,320
can concludes what's the difference in
height during a mystery for cyclists

47
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,250
because they know when they're going
uphill or downhill so they can plan

48
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:33,840
their routes I forgot to explain the
parts of it because you'll notice the

49
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,950
parts of interface this current loved
one

50
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:45,010
you can first you see is the search bar
the part for routing directions its

51
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:51,380
wasn't there all the time its new
feature you can edit the map you can

52
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:59,980
view the previous said it's time you can
export factor data you can see GPS

53
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:06,050
traces of people who uploaded their
trips online so you can see where they

54
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:15,690
went and later in the editing part you
can trace those GPS trips and draw maps

55
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:24,480
on top of them for example go to the
Help Area

56
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:32,310
some beginners inform how to start
contributing were using the data consist

57
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:41,109
several different layers you have map
key you have the share button to export

58
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:48,470
picture or link to this particular view

59
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:57,540
embedded HTML website here you can see
the map notes if you take this you'll

60
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,480
see other people have left on the map
and you don't have to be logged in in

61
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:12,340
order to to leave notes here this is an
experimental map it's called a former

62
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:19,180
against you can recognize this place
we're here

63
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:25,709
currently doesn't look like this museum
but actually and

64
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:32,160
the screenshot was taken yesterday and
you can see this white lines on top of

65
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,480
it when you consider its dark so it
represents the current weather time of

66
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:48,180
day on top of the map so yes it was
raining so this white lines were

67
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,180
actually going down so represented
what's the weather like at a place for

68
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:02,060
example if I want to New York then I
will see what's the weather like this is

69
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:11,380
a map of Berlin's oh it's often given as
an example of how detailed map could be

70
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:21,960
so you can plan the trip with her kids
are and I intentionally left out one

71
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:30,940
part time anyone see what is it the part
in the top in the bottom right corner

72
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:39,040
that's where the data comes from should
not be limited so this is an example of

73
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:48,140
wrong practice so for beginners I'm not
sure how many of those are here but

74
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:56,330
let's just say that you have to gather
data uploaded it is somehow and under

75
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:03,590
the maps from the beta and OpenStreetMap
is not just this web interface its

76
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:12,640
database that contains vector data can
be exported by anyone it's free and it

77
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,860
can be used in

78
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:22,079
many different applications and you
don't have to display the roads the way

79
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,410
they're displayed here you can imagine
your own way to display them so here are

80
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:34,290
few links for wiki pages for this or
something

81
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:43,250
Logan stork is poorly designed website
but it contains a few useful links for

82
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:51,829
serbian community and learn about some
things like instructions on how to begin

83
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:59,199
with these are few agreements is serving
community

84
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:16,030
this name calling us or is obligatory
field Serbian Cyrillic the other special

85
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:29,750
item which is too easy for other
developers and people who use the maps

86
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:35,790
not to have to translate to rate each
time they load them up so they can just

87
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,949
load both scripts display them at the
same time without thinking about grammar

88
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:47,830
or exceptions or any other things while
you are editing maps you can use this

89
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:56,330
Serbian translator eight er which is a
plugin for Jos Sam its best way to use

90
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:02,110
it is to enter the name incirlik and
then transliterated to Latin because

91
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,760
there are no exceptions that way if you
do it in reverse

92
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:13,710
you might get some exceptions that are
not already programmed into this trust

93
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:19,279
literature so you would have to be a
local to speak Serbian in order to

94
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:29,310
avatar right name in the database this
is just ways to display roads and

95
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:37,819
we have highways motorways and other
roads are named like in serbian really

96
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:44,600
put a barrier which is why translated as
ordered but it's just free translation

97
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,790
these are marks I'm not sure if they're
displayed on actual roads are just used

98
00:13:51,790 --> 00:14:03,150
in government papers to be sure which
road they're talking about so are there

99
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:11,699
any questions about this part does show
a few apps from the phone and how to use

100
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:45,910
this data ok

101
00:14:45,910 --> 00:15:01,069
used a few months ago and I liked it
because it was it worked it did the job

102
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,640
so its

103
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,470
translated into service and

104
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:21,890
maybe I should switch to English this
presentation it has separate settings

105
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:29,699
for the language of the map and for the
language of the application switching

106
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:46,730
application language too so if you take
the map you will have for example

107
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:52,210
something like this

108
00:15:52,210 --> 00:16:04,040
this full screen so you can view the
factor is rendered inside the

109
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:13,880
application so I don't know why but they
chose not represent grass probably

110
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:22,030
because it's just hard on the CPU and
doesn't carry much they are so if you

111
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,750
see

112
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:33,440
house numbers and other interesting
locations that you can seen any other

113
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:41,000
map application for example Google Maps
only difference is that the whole map is

114
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:50,899
inside this phone its all flying and
reload the map ones and that's it

115
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:54,129
because this is community

116
00:16:54,129 --> 00:17:01,350
crowdsourced data once in a while you
get offered with an update for the whole

117
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:09,429
map so you up the whole country for
example one summer and you always have

118
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:20,209
the most up-to-date maps which are
continually drawn in by volunteers from

119
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:28,429
around the world it depends on the
application they're compiling the files

120
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:34,159
themselves so they expert the map data
to some kind of their server and then

121
00:17:34,159 --> 00:18:16,850
they process it for their application I
can check it inside up so

122
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:39,679
Europe 13 megafight so it's pretty
compiled its pretty dense but on the

123
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:49,040
contrary if you go to germany you will
see that it's eight hundred megabytes

124
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:55,860
and the suggest you download files
individually for example parts of the

125
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:03,750
country because it's too large and too
detailed for one download so this is the

126
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:12,270
way they design it they have routing so
you can use it as a navigation device

127
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:23,490
instead of this dedicated device in your
car simulation of navigation so you can

128
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:30,370
see where you're going to go without
actually going there you can set

129
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:49,000
startin' destination locations so this
is one application online belgrade

130
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,570
because it contains proprietary beta but
its overlaid on top of OpenStreetMap

131
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:06,790
data so this is just another way to use
it so you can see my search interface

132
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:18,280
and this one contains all the house
numbers in belgrade for example the real

133
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:25,899
estate my database doesn't have these so
the boat license to use the house

134
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,570
numbers and the integrated in that
without contributing back to

135
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:37,820
OpenStreetMap database so if you go to
belgrade you should use this one and the

136
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:47,309
other ones don't contain all the Taylor

137
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:55,769
it's named in foreground they have a
website for granted US application for

138
00:20:55,769 --> 00:21:01,139
accessing that they don't and it doesn't
store offline you have to be online to

139
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:11,229
use this so here's one application
always say it's open source application

140
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:19,340
and it allows for all kinds of editing
and you can actually comport compile an

141
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:26,490
expert your own map and important in
this application so it doesn't have to

142
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:31,899
be downloaded through this app you can
do any map you can imagine your own map

143
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:41,860
void then inserted into this application
so we are here you can see this place

144
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:58,799
all the data you can have the shop also
the routing for cars bicycles changed to

145
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:06,850
night mode I guess automatically because
of the driving so does have a lot of

146
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:12,908
add-ons for example contour lines and
bunch of other things that can be

147
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:14,870
developed

148
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:23,469
by other programmers because it's open
sourced so we go to the mountain part

149
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:32,270
you can see me maybe you can see the
shading that represents the mountain and

150
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:37,720
then sharing is not part of the
OpenStreetMap it's another database but

151
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:49,340
all the data is processed so you get
this much better map and

152
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:58,360
last app displays maps is the one I use
the month ago and I think it's the best

153
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:10,070
user experience so far because it just
works it's the most affluent just closed

154
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,510
there's no lack in rendering maps

155
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:27,360
just flies there's also options to
download their own maps and this one has

156
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:39,189
a bit not so many settings available
because you can just set a few things

157
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:45,820
like you can choose to want have resumed
bottles were looking pinch-to-zoom

158
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:54,149
and measurement units can choose where
to store the maps I think all of these

159
00:23:54,150 --> 00:24:01,570
apps have something like this and what's
interesting about it and other apps that

160
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:12,470
they can use the map language and they
can choose it so this map has names

161
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,880
entered both incirlik and Latin script
and they can show it if they want to

162
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:24,350
this phone is set to use English
language as the default so recognizes it

163
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:29,969
and says okay you probably don't know
how to read Cyrillic but will displace

164
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:36,240
other side so that you can compare it if
you see a plate on some building so you

165
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:45,730
can find your way quickly if for example
your phone is I don't know german bitch

166
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:51,660
if there are street names in German
German or in any other language of the

167
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:59,180
data is available so this doesn't allow
you to switch it manually but others do

168
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:09,600
so its choice of the program is that
make their this one is currently offline

169
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:30,189
I think they can render it online to
check the size of the map serbia here is

170
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:37,320
41 megabytes so it's four times larger
than just depends on the format the

171
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:45,720
programme's chose to use for example
Italy is about 500 megabytes or even

172
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:53,120
more so it's a bit complicated to
download it and one chance so you can

173
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:03,590
see sizes different countries and the
problem with this app that I had was if

174
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:10,840
you want to update the map they download
the whole map and then delete the old

175
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:17,110
data so if the map there is six hundred
megabytes for a certain country you have

176
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:26,419
to have 500 megabytes available for what
you have to have twice the data only

177
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,200
plan is the previous data related but

178
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,250
you can become the first deliver data
and then download the new one so it

179
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:43,130
works that way to the interesting thing
the maps is that you can for example

180
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:56,250
mark place displays information you can
see the coordinates in different ways

181
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,770
different standards

182
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:07,860
you can choose to go to have routing
options you can book market you can add

183
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:17,840
notes for it you can change the color
for example and it's the simplest I have

184
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,580
used with OpenStreetMap so it's mark
commendation for anyone having a hundred

185
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:31,870
device and I think this one is also
available for iPhones I'm not sure which

186
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:41,330
is available for Windows devices cuz I
haven't used them here's one that is

187
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:51,439
supposed to help contributors but it
works only with GPS it's made for the

188
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,000
people who are entering house numbers so
you're walking on the street you turn on

189
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,300
and you just say this number this number
that number and it automatically saves

190
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:07,870
the location so it makes putting numbers
on the map

191
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:16,629
much easier and here's an example of
other services can benefit from

192
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:26,250
OpenStreetMap the service is called a
pillory and I tried it on the way here

193
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:31,830
but it didn't work as well as it should
because of the weather the bed GPS

194
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:38,590
reception so I go to review it will say
I have

195
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:48,289
several photos available that have taken
while driving here so you can see the

196
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:55,230
pictures

197
00:28:55,230 --> 00:29:02,950
case when clicking this ok sign
approving the pictures that they can be

198
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:11,679
uploaded to the server and probably
heard of Google Street View

199
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:20,640
so this is crowd-sourced version of it
when it gets uploaded to the server they

200
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,549
process the images they smudge the
number plates on cars this much faces

201
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:36,918
from workers from passers-by and then
they make it available for public to to

202
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:52,740
use and to view so maybe I'll be able to

203
00:29:52,740 --> 00:30:09,170
this is how you take pictures says GPS
is not available so you're and I think

204
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:18,820
it has options for walking so it allows
you to have smaller distance between

205
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:25,770
pictures and to just walking the street
and take pictures of the city and then

206
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:34,280
uploaded to the server and do it just
like Google Street View others so you

207
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:39,889
have the Explorer Sport

208
00:30:39,890 --> 00:31:16,650
browser try

209
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:42,740
represent parts where they have the data
were someone actually took pictures and

210
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:55,070
choose part of it

211
00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:05,320
other people's what are people taking
pictures of the travel so it so there is

212
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,559
kind of slow now but if you have many
pictures from different angles they

213
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:17,899
combine all the pictures in 13 team and
so you kind of get the impression that

214
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:32,120
your sphere of pictures around you so
this is an example of how other services

215
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,840
other businesses can benefit from
OpenStreetMap data because these maps in

216
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:44,769
the background that you see our
OpenStreetMap so if they wanted to

217
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:50,169
display these pictures on any other map
they will have to pay for the license

218
00:32:50,169 --> 00:33:00,039
and this way they have cheap start-up
business so if you have any other ideas

219
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:08,710
how to use the opposite number please
save us now or keep it for yourself and

220
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:18,960
earn money from it so that these apps if
you know any other arab to like me to

221
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:38,800
review here say or questions or anything
else

222
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:52,570
yes

223
00:33:52,570 --> 00:34:14,449
it was a bit complicated for us to start
from the beginning it's a great idea for

224
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:18,569
example you could drive the cart in the
city

225
00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:23,179
aside for example borrows your own
streets maybe learn something new about

226
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:35,940
the city so it's interesting thanks
anyone else better thank you very much
