1
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:31,010
ok as you can see my name is Peter I'm
starting in traumatic or computer

2
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:37,320
science mathematics a member of our club
felt great

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:45,430
also writing for a reliever for that
matters involved free labor open source

4
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:53,390
software writing mostly about corruption
privacy security stuff online and

5
00:00:53,390 --> 00:01:02,890
offline so this talk is gonna be about
few things but stress passport and pass

6
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:11,830
phases so the differences differences
between and also what is bad her right

7
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,750
measuring passwords friend South Pass
for the past three strengths are

8
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:26,969
actually measured and how server like
Google Facebook whatever candle users

9
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:36,130
passwords insecure way mostly of them
don't handled properly and where and I

10
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:44,479
say when the database of your server or
service online gets hacked you need some

11
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:51,420
way to protect your users passwords and
send them mails to change everything and

12
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:59,750
stuff like that so then we'll get or how
fast we're actually hacked some attacks

13
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:06,119
on user's password my fishing brute
force or social engineering and at the

14
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:16,040
end and then and the enemy matter
alternative methods of passers of

15
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,410
eternity pallets of out of the occasion
on websites rather than pass with

16
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,700
Ospreys so what

17
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:31,200
with my past right most of the users
think that eight character password or

18
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,829
something that will be enough to protect
them they changed I don't know as with

19
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:49,420
this dollar symbol or with 0448 with for
those who make their is that will make

20
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:55,768
their password more stronger but that's
not the true in most cases because

21
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:01,010
attackers also know these methods and
they'll kind of try these combinations

22
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:16,578
for a password to password here another
bad and other bad how is this a property

23
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:22,630
that they are harder to remember as your
password get more complex than have more

24
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:31,950
random characters is more and more
harder to remember it and then you're

25
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:39,319
forced to do some I don't know possible
managers or to write them down

26
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:44,738
you can't remember are you different
passwords with their complex for about

27
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:50,100
twenty 67 websites right you can hold it

28
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:57,989
dating your head and if you're not doing
the password right if you're not

29
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:04,970
generating them randomly then you're
susceptible to social engineering

30
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:10,750
attacks through guess if the attacker
knows you know if your interests draw

31
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,810
but you do what you like hobby they can
then easily get your passport if you

32
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:23,860
make your passwords looking in your room
looking around or making from the words

33
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:30,160
or symbols from your job or copyright so
make your passwords more

34
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,390
unique and random something that's not
related to you in any way

35
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:44,610
other thing is that the people we are
humans are not very good at creating

36
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:52,710
anything random so we're species of
partners and we use some part of us to

37
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,460
remember passwords or two creative
that's not very good with it comes to

38
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:03,390
creating right wrapping up a certain
order in other ways and yeah it's hard

39
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:08,640
to remember does the defense nonsense
password with numbers special characters

40
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:22,430
that I saw that on internet was that
talk by Lorrie faith Cranor she made

41
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:31,930
this security password security blanket
that has top 1000 most used passwords in

42
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:39,920
the world so you I love you like 123456
87 or something like that

43
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:50,890
the size of the password is how actually
culprit but if the password is find how

44
00:05:50,890 --> 00:06:01,280
people can be found on various websites
so another thing this is this is top 25

45
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,080
passes right

46
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,889
another thing when you're starting
password is that it's very hard to

47
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:17,620
obtain true database of user's password
you can't just go to the CSR said hey

48
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,460
gimme are used as part of the right
people you know what he will give you so

49
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:32,688
you start with the facts that happens
all the time on the internet like Ashley

50
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:37,789
Madison Tony Hawks or whatever whatever
someone get some of some sort of its

51
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:43,139
cost-cutting threat has dumped the
database on the internet or by bill and

52
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:50,919
you you have that database to to study
right but that's not good because you

53
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:56,940
have you can be sure that they that they
didn't tamper with that they tasted

54
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:03,099
better database is actually true and
original the real one so there are many

55
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:08,009
problems when you're starting the
password it's not easy to get to rely on

56
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:17,129
users so what pass rates many of you
might also already know the passphrase

57
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:24,409
is just appraise it has word from the
dictionary somehow ordered in it it can

58
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:31,509
it doesn't need to be heard from any
dictionary right it can also contain few

59
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:41,589
passwords randomly selected in the order
and there is a question what are good

60
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:48,670
and secure past phrases so and how to
create them to generating so we'll get

61
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:57,620
back to this and what we've said
previously is that people are not good

62
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:03,230
in creating random things so the same
applies for the password and passphrase

63
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:09,910
if you can find some software online
that can generate random passwords or

64
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:16,140
passphrase whatever you can use the open
source software I keep a storekeeper 6

65
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,700
try to use the open source software not
a close source one cuz you can trust

66
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:29,090
them right and then that's one quiz can
you actually guess what the goods fast

67
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,049
race and what's the bet on what's the
most secure and what spaces are not

68
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:38,780
secure

69
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:46,350
think and they're beyond answer so
they're random password some of them

70
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:52,200
around them some of them are generated
by human some of them are generated by

71
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
computer

72
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:04,260
some of them are from the internet and
that's the correct answer so as we can

73
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:10,250
see passphrase won first place to pass
pastries not so random not so secure

74
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:16,760
right even though it has the numbers and
letters and its long wear long it's not

75
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,780
security code is not random will get to
how to measure passed a strange little

76
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:30,319
bit later and my pastors is hard to
guess is not very heart to guess right

77
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,830
because its sentence it's not random the
humans created sentence and if you know

78
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:42,880
the human who created the new you some
social engineer the taxing you get to

79
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,820
know his password correct hospital in
stable you already know this one its

80
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,000
firm xkcd

81
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,280
yeah that means that every every
phosphorus you see anywhere in the lab

82
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:07,439
is not so secure because it has been on
it from then on it's in every database

83
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,430
for practice so you need to create your
password by yourself and try to do it

84
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:26,410
tried to do it as more and the magic and
get it promotes killing by Visa skin it

85
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:32,660
is the password generated by my computer
its random so it just so happens that

86
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:39,199
this password came up out Red Cross
County pharmacy medicine why is this not

87
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:50,310
good what yes so you can see that you
can actually guessed that the person who

88
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:56,650
created this past for all these words of
similar meaning and the password

89
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:01,130
person who created the password has
something to do with medicine and

90
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:10,450
pharmacy or whatever and similar is
police gun cuffs under-covered chief and

91
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:16,950
red card against the Yellow are so not
good because all the words are from the

92
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,500
same same kind of stuff right

93
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:34,180
Ospreys advantages so is there to create
maybe not because you're not so good at

94
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,400
creating random entity and you should
stick to programs that meant for

95
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:47,170
creating random things but if you're in
the stuff you you can actually learn to

96
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,360
create stuff that are more indirect
definitely easier to remember the

97
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,160
password you you already remember half
of the past four the previous sites

98
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,969
right light

99
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:12,220
no need to write it down as I said you
are the remembered and hard to ultimate

100
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:23,310
attacks because as you can see I checked
in now in this in this past races there

101
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:29,239
is no order when you see and then you
don't know what actually text can be

102
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:39,810
achieved through or now or whatever it
is why there is no there is not any rule

103
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:50,079
of how to how what is going after water
before what so if created random it

104
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:56,839
needs to be brute force right hand Rd
more secure maybe because they are

105
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:03,000
passed freezes and they can be longer
but still people will be able to

106
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,209
remember that remember them then more
secure if you create pass phrase that

107
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:16,508
has two words and every word has two
letters that won't be some secure

108
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:19,379
password part

109
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:29,889
it will be more secure than I don't know
three or four characters password so you

110
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:39,689
ever heard of this thing I swear it is a
matter of creating pass places you just

111
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:50,959
need I serve at least it has 700,000 76
very you need the one that I sand paper

112
00:13:50,959 --> 00:14:01,059
and band then you just throwing the dice
the number the 2008 the dice represent

113
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:07,089
some bird and you collecting those words
and you generate the Bosphorus this is

114
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:16,709
for real paranoid once because there
were talks and people wrote about in

115
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:22,169
till compromising so the random number
generator in their processor for

116
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:28,809
creating a perception keys 2020 Olympic
records or something like that

117
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:34,159
for creating an essay keys for
public-private encryption if you heard

118
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:42,829
about that that the stories I won't
comment story much more so you have a

119
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:51,628
link when you were you can get diapered
least if you want to play with it and we

120
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:58,449
are here at entropy so how password
strength are measured little bit of math

121
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:11,728
right so you have a tractor set for
example if you use tractors and starter

122
00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:21,809
set is all lower case letters or upper
case letters or numbers and use all

123
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:29,279
available to two characters special
characters on your keyboard not using

124
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,579
the space bar

125
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:42,160
campus then it all adds up 94 so you
have or eight characters any character

126
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:50,769
can be any of these eighty poor we have
eight places where you have 884 possible

127
00:15:50,769 --> 00:16:02,079
things in your power to set the
ninety-four to the power of eight and do

128
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,758
the longer it on the base to that
because computer server only in binary

129
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:28,579
things right and this long number here
here this number he represents all the

130
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:36,339
possibilities for eight character
password if used the starter set of all

131
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:44,069
94 available and when you do the
calculation and do the math get to

132
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:51,988
elaborate on the base to this number it
is 52 so if that means that this any

133
00:16:51,989 --> 00:17:00,110
password that has eight characters and
his sum of all these at least one of all

134
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,129
this possible

135
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:10,539
lower case letters uppercase letters
digits and special characters it will be

136
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:18,730
52 bit entropy that would be it's ranked
right we'll talk a little bit later how

137
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:26,250
what's the minimum entropy for your past

138
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:34,070
and when we are here for caspases
calculation is similar

139
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:44,429
you're not using character set is
released so if you're using some

140
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:50,920
vocabulary your vocabulary can have
about 20,000 and that's your character

141
00:17:50,920 --> 00:18:00,100
set and pass for land is actually how
many words you use from the character

142
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,090
set or vocabulary and it to the similar
calculation and if you're creating

143
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:16,459
forward pass phrase from twenty twenty
thousand words dictionary it is about 57

144
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:28,630
bit password strength 44 forward pass
pass pass rates so yes that is this is

145
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:41,960
an example so any for the passphrase
chosen from twenty randomly from 20,000

146
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:49,770
birds has more entropy than any eight
character password so it's more stronger

147
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:58,450
and yet it promotes killed by two pieces
is easy to remember and much much

148
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:04,360
stronger past but you can see that there
is no special characters there is no

149
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:14,350
upper case letters there is an outburst
but it is still strong pathways ok

150
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:23,559
I did a lot of calculations like this
with low great powers and get this chart

151
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:33,990
right you can see that you need at least
80 bit at the entropy for a strong

152
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:44,700
password or stop a space this means that
if you looking blue curve care you need

153
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:57,640
at least 13 characters in your password
password and for passphrase is if if

154
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:07,130
you're using let's say die spur that
green one you need about seven burt's so

155
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,500
seven words

156
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:16,059
sprays choosing from dice where it's
very small dictionary though is shares

157
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:23,580
the same strength it's thirty beat
passport and if you're using a very long

158
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:30,590
dictionary for creating pass places
thats the yellow one you need

159
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:39,459
approximately by only five so it raises
it all depends how big your dictionary

160
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:46,480
is when choosing the right of its yes
this is the

161
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:59,320
this is the famous xkcd it actually
quite good explains what we are just

162
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:07,080
talked about even though the mat behind
on the mill slides are not is not good

163
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:14,389
correct horseback very stable for
unaccompanied birds on the contrary you

164
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:25,010
have a password that has 13 characters
his number suffocated and lower case

165
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:34,879
letters special characters like and then
he replaced a 44 and with zero and stuff

166
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,780
like that but then if you didn't
remember these passports right if you

167
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,928
didn't write it down and it is easy to
forget your passport because you didn't

168
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:54,940
switch all letters with zero since you
were you you can easily forget what you

169
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:02,049
did and your passport is not that strong
as correct course battery stable which

170
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:06,389
the comment actually said as the end of
this comic you actually remembered

171
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:14,340
correct force battery stable but but you
didn't remember the password and its

172
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,879
route twenty years of powerful to
successfully trained everyone to use

173
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,360
passwords that are hard for him is to
remember but is it for computers to kiss

174
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,070
yes

175
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:31,710
so I measured I found some online
password strength measures

176
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:38,560
strength calculations right and the
measure you can see I choose only upper

177
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:49,040
or lower case letters for possible land
of 18 characters and it gives you a deep

178
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:58,300
orbits so I think about eighty it is you
can say very secure right

179
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:06,899
need nine years and the good advice is
if you're using pass phrases or

180
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,990
passwords whatever change it once in a
year

181
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,670
computers do get better and faster every
year

182
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:25,680
your pass for a price will be able to
act sooner or later so yeah password

183
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:31,230
downright if you still want stick to
passwords don't want change the past

184
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:39,870
races as I said you some open source
software like a pastor people six it is

185
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:47,300
good for program for actually creating
the random passwords and passphrase it

186
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,100
encrypts all your passwords which one

187
00:23:51,100 --> 00:24:01,290
yeah very secure one and make sure when
you're choosing comedy bits it is about

188
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:12,520
80 change them often and when you're at
public wifi like here at you somewhere

189
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:23,309
of fiction right VPN or tour will be
well do good

190
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:30,330
so how service actually handle the
user's password they do something called

191
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:39,240
hashing and hashing is similar to
encryption but it doesn't use any key so

192
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:48,429
the key for your data is your data
itself it pulls the dictator goes to

193
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:56,119
some function and you have the same out
and good property or bad one about

194
00:24:56,119 --> 00:25:04,470
hashing function is no matter how big
your file is it can be gigabytes long if

195
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:15,190
you change one bit in a huge file output
will be totally different so whenever

196
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:19,950
something is changed the here Palace
totally different it doesn't look

197
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:28,210
anything like previous one and they just
use our site says OK login tell me your

198
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:33,629
password you entered the password its
cash the password and put the password

199
00:25:33,629 --> 00:25:41,049
in the database when you log in later
say locking again ok then your password

200
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:45,110
it had it doesn't keep your passport but
it keeps the hash function of your past

201
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:54,299
and it did it does the calculation of it
through the hash function if the cash

202
00:25:54,299 --> 00:26:02,200
that has been in a database matches with
new culture on the site will actually

203
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,360
get right

204
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:13,919
that wasn't so secure because people
figured that out and when you're using

205
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:21,080
fest hashing function like him the fire
show on that are broken

206
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:32,760
five years ago people actually tables of
cash so they say will be that her BB BB

207
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,580
with that this evil that has hello will
be that has password with a shovel pass

208
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:42,580
for the one that hit and killed all the
table when they had the website and get

209
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:48,490
all your hashes they just have to match
the cash they have in their ramble table

210
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:56,510
and to see what your past 10 people got
this idea of something and something is

211
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:03,740
just adding some string to the and or to
the beginning of your actual pass with

212
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:10,790
so it can be some something added before
or after your password and then when

213
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:15,290
that salt get it out of your past what
it is

214
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:25,020
to the hash function and that store this
is done because this is done because the

215
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:31,910
same passwords have the same cash and if
you can't the website and have and get

216
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:39,860
the old test password and you see the
most common shares will be most probably

217
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,389
the most common passwords used any of
you know the most common password is

218
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:50,310
12345 than you actually broke that
database of shit and when you do

219
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:59,290
something like salting you're making the
same password look different if choosing

220
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:06,379
South differently for every password so
don't use the same solved or every

221
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:14,370
password change the south for every user
when you want to test

222
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:29,969
said everything like that but be creeped
be crypt is hashing function newer one

223
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:40,050
that is slower and more secure that and
apply and shower don't use broken

224
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:47,760
hashing algorithm for the poor and the
one you can look it up by how they're

225
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:56,590
broken every said generate random south
for every user as used to review the

226
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:05,428
south this is advised for Artemis right
if you have some user database and their

227
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:06,809
password

228
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:16,460
this is the advice you may have heard
about Ashley Madison hawk they used very

229
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:23,850
slow very slow hashing out like be
creeped they did alright everything

230
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:30,669
every security tape that I mention here
they get it right but they still got hat

231
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:39,010
and what's even more interesting that
111 million passwords are tracked in

232
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:48,080
just 10 days how is this done well some
of the army logins for the website

233
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:56,199
use md5 hash and that the five fish has
also the same salt for everybody creep

234
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:04,630
tests password and that the people who
get who got the dump of the head figure

235
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:13,220
it out and they will be they were able
to crack some of the past was not all so

236
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:20,190
the best thing that estimate is indeed
is Dave reuse the same has the same salt

237
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:33,570
for every possible and that password
credit rating ok it can be cracked

238
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:41,610
through CPU GPU or new between the
Arctic miners to be calling us liars are

239
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:52,809
made especially to crack shot 54 56 part
hashes it is specialized color and

240
00:30:52,809 --> 00:31:03,899
graphics cards can crack and he and type
of fishing this is interesting because

241
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:14,918
people who don't know what is most of
get get to be head with something like

242
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:15,610
this

243
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:22,209
well attacker actually set up his own
version of I don't know your bank

244
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:29,010
website and if you don't track the URL
you can actually enter the past or your

245
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:35,090
actual password for your bank to his
side and then he got your bus that's the

246
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:41,679
user's fault not the server

247
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:57,430
the xkcd comic for social engineering
let's say something about gatien that's

248
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:03,850
no matter that Google use any other
companies also used to cater to

249
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:10,320
authenticate users when they log in to
some web-sites it is more secure they're

250
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,520
using just the past whether you're a
hashing it or something it or not

251
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:23,500
because if your database get some gets
hacked and someone gets all your

252
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:31,960
passwords that's what he cannot login
unless he has some newly randomly

253
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:38,950
generated called that is sent to your
mobile only if he had some more about

254
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:48,580
that he can login to site you be keys
that are hard they are hardware USB keys

255
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:57,710
that have built in some key keys whether
their public key encryption or

256
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:15,080
or not and you can login only if you
have the physical USB bachelor party or

257
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:23,210
special recognition and fingerprints yes
there's some statement for creek that

258
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,789
work for

259
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:32,890
into new generator generations of
processor combine it with some of their

260
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:41,820
proprietary software has the ability to
login users based on their faces or eyes

261
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:48,350
or whatever you have something like
fingerprints vacation on your iPhone

262
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:54,000
that's something that's new and
alternative to passport in past races

263
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,870
but as this comic said this is not a
good solution right at the end of the

264
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:10,690
day it's still use someone kidnapped you
or hydroxy you be torturous you and he

265
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:22,070
cuts the password right

266
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:27,730
talking here about 496 bitter heresay
keys that are public and private key

267
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:38,730
encryption you can use it to encrypt
your hard disk right

268
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:49,260
there is interesting talk and research
paper has been released on the topic

269
00:34:49,260 --> 00:35:02,290
asha is that while the password you idea
that helps the face up some service web

270
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:07,960
service and when they have a problem of
storing the passwords they come up with

271
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:15,280
the idea of having a very large file at
the server I mean one terabyte or two

272
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:23,690
terabyte large file that is secret
randomly generated file that actually

273
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:33,480
that actually is part of out of the case
method so that if the character that

274
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:44,390
doesn't have this file then he can
access any database or logging and

275
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,460
that's about it

276
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:58,970
any questions

277
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:09,660
that is not secure people should not use
anything from any website as to pass for

278
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,000
the passphrase for their secret things
right

279
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,310
anything you find any website that has
that has hey you can use this fast for

280
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:26,690
the past visit to secure things a very
long that's not good because anybody

281
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:36,220
else also have that password or
passphrase in the database of all the

282
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:43,669
side that generate passwords where they
are not secure because you don't know

283
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:48,660
how they generated password by the
Arboretum is on the server side and you

284
00:36:48,660 --> 00:37:01,399
don't get that right so don't use that
ok

285
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:12,450
salting really help or does it only help
with rainbow tables rainbow tables are

286
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,120
not the most important attack today

287
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:22,450
assaulting helps if done properly do not
reuse the soft

288
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:28,640
generate that you ran the result for
every user and then you can actually

289
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:38,660
store that you generated south alongside
with the best thing when you have a user

290
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:44,319
password and newly generated the run the
South that gets passed in the Hedgehog

291
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,820
rate has struggled to produce some hash
and you ten-story in your database that

292
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:56,560
hash and that random South you generate
so that is secure but then if if like

293
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,340
the database gets leaked yes the
attackers will have the hash but they

294
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:06,420
will also have the salt right yes but
then they have their needs

295
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:16,030
to apply the rebel table attacks for
every user differently every user will

296
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:26,119
have different south so it is something
that in a way stops out of my to the tax

297
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:34,660
it is not the Puri Puri secure right so
use the cash algorithm that is low like

298
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:44,529
be creeped don't use the amplified that
are fast and broken thanks again but

299
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:52,799
isn't it better to use like with salt
which you actually generate some

300
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:58,730
proprietary algorithm you have like some
users input ok which is always the same

301
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:03,069
like lets a user name of the user name
and then generate the salt from that

302
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:09,029
while some proprietary algorithm and
then you have always that over a time

303
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:14,430
when you're trying to check so you don't
have to store the salt and salt is

304
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:20,868
different for every user ok I think
that's ok that these better solution but

305
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:26,400
don't use proprietary things anything
that can't be outdated it is no single

306
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,849
not not proprietary but only on server
side on the the thing that you only know

307
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:41,030
the algorithm ok yes but as we saw with
Ashley Madison hawk they had the secret

308
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:50,990
hash for each subsequent cash for each
user password and it got it covered

309
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:58,569
right so anytime you want to hide
something it's not good in a way because

310
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:03,140
when it something that you're hiding
gets found your all databases breached

311
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:16,720
it is bad it is better but not nothing
is 100 percent secure ok another

312
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:29,779
question yeah aircraft business but
there are talks with ok ok that's the

313
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:46,820
different doc ok no questions ok we get
cash some how can we know which was used

314
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:57,330
it can be I don't know actually but I
think the size of the hash that you get

315
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:02,640
actually can tell you what Albertans you
is if you use the five it will be a

316
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:15,640
smaller cash it will use char 212 it'll
be much larger cash so it depends on the

317
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:27,020
link itself if no more crash since then
we've done thank
