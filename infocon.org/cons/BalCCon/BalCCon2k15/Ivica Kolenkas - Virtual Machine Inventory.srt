1
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:27,260
so hello everyone I hope that you will
settle in its kind of an empty room

2
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,070
compared to the to the previous
presentation and I won't be as as

3
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:37,190
interesting as he was definitely my talk
is going to be about virtual machine

4
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:42,530
inventory it is basically a service
switch inventories your virtual machines

5
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:48,610
across different hypervisors across
different systems fuel few things about

6
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:54,680
me I'm definitely soon-to-be husband
because I proposed to my girls were few

7
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,019
days ago and this has this one has to be
on top if you know women should

8
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:04,250
definitely know that they know about
this stuff so that has to be under up

9
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:11,550
apart from my personal life I'm a system
engineer at six O Hara guys I'm also

10
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:19,100
self-taught I think OJ who wanted to be
a sysadmin for all all of his life I

11
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,759
never got any real formal education
about it they tried to teach me dotnet

12
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:32,759
in college but I politely refused and
went to Python instead this talk in a

13
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,240
few few few words about it is definitely
going to be brief and all attempts at

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:49,399
humor stop here so few words about the
brick background and this whole idea a

15
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:55,750
few let's say a year ago I started
working for for my current employer as

16
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:01,229
you may have noticed its it's direct and
at the moment there were four of four of

17
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:10,149
our US for engineers who controlled
three virtual hosts with around 80 or 90

18
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:16,500
virtual machines it was a mass back then
and our current situation is that we

19
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,860
have five hosts with 130 and counting

20
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,840
virtual machines and it's still a mess
definitely a mess so

21
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,810
few months back we got a new guy he
immediately got the team lead position

22
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,670
and of course he wanted to break down of
all the various projects and virtual

23
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:41,089
machines that were involved in those
projects and who is managing do was in

24
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:47,480
yond turned off and stuff like that and
a colleague of mine got this daunting

25
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:54,660
task to inventory all of this is his
living with us right now if he did it

26
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:02,950
definitely hit it then we got a CTO and
of course he wanted a breakdown of all

27
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,429
the virtual machines and all the
projects and all the stuff then the CEO

28
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:14,170
wanted to break down and after which
came my own mental breakdown of

29
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,929
repeating all of this when they see I
want to break down they want the virtual

30
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,819
machine where it's located how much RAM
is it using how many IP addresses are

31
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:31,548
the paid for Saudi our toes public IP's
are their private and much much more

32
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:33,019
information

33
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:38,940
of course it's it's definitely hard to
keep track of all of it by hand so I

34
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:46,109
came up with an idea to create a service
which will do this automatically almost

35
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:52,180
in real time and the service is composed
of two components the first one is the

36
00:03:52,180 --> 00:04:02,970
agent an agent is a simple python simple
an agent easy script dad is deployed to

37
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,470
a a virtualization host and its uses
various techniques to gather data about

38
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:14,569
all the VMS that are running on that
host now when I see very various

39
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:19,940
techniques it really depends on the host
so let's say that the hostess hyper-v

40
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:26,410
which we run unfortunately the
techniques used

41
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:33,640
are some PowerShell scripts that trigger
the hyper-v and get information and

42
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,550
let's see if the agent is the ploy to
win OpenStack open using OpenStack Nova

43
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:46,640
compute the agent is smart enough to
know to use opens Dec API's and together

44
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,580
information about those those machines
the central as you may have seen on on

45
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,690
the slide the central component is the
server which is of course running Python

46
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:04,900
as well and the databases is MongoDB and
agent talks or communicates with the

47
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:12,349
server using secure what's it called web
site see our secrets so all the all the

48
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:18,270
communication between them is encrypted
the thirds and I would say optional part

49
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:27,890
is the agent part down down there it is
composed of a single angularjs interface

50
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:35,880
UI 24 the CEO and CTO and all all the
CDs so they can click and mother around

51
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:45,280
along with with gathering essential
information about the VMC it has a few

52
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,450
additional features one of which is
continuous monitoring of the Empower

53
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:58,640
state it's not meant to be a monitoring
tool it's just a feature that allows you

54
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,300
to track when your machine was powered
off and when it was powered on and

55
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,030
that's it

56
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,989
the second feature is to collect all the
hardware changes between the states of

57
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,910
the virtual machine so let's say that
you add more RAM to it then it will be

58
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,280
capped at events analog get into the
database database so that you can create

59
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:27,489
all those nice and fancy charts for DUI
and the 32 is that this agent also

60
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:35,210
gathers virtualization host info meaning
which which operating system so yeah

61
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,590
those those are the information that my
my service gathers

62
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:45,200
so want to be inside he gathers name CPU
counter and hostname and everything that

63
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,950
you can see on the slide and 42 p.m.
post it collects smaller amount of the

64
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:56,219
tub because that amount is enough for
the moment including detailed discs info

65
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:02,000
so every petition with with free and
what's the other run with freemen

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,330
occupied space yea during development
this is my side project my my hobby

67
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:15,440
project I stumbledupon quite a few
problems and and gotchas and most of

68
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,740
them were caused by polls showing
general because they've never use

69
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,800
PowerShell before so it at the moment
there is there is only a hyper-v agent

70
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:34,340
in production interesting other problems
generated by bipolar shell and it's

71
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:41,520
Jason output and UTF eight because
someone at Microsoft decided that when

72
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,789
you export something to Jason you have
to specifically you have to specify its

73
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:53,150
depth so if you're jason is to levels
that is if it's two levels nested

74
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:59,570
fine when you have third level of
nesting then it just breaks and nothing

75
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:05,420
yeah and that's by default I don't know
why so I had to explicitly add that

76
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,520
miners deaths seconds

77
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,799
problem second gotcha that got me
spinning for for like two days was that

78
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:24,860
when when its outputs the JSON it's not
a properly formatted it uses I don't

79
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,160
know why but they add bite order mark
the beginning of the file so when you

80
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:38,000
read it up in Python it turns out to be
invalid still I don't know why so with

81
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,159
the help of good people from Stack
Overflow I'm yeah I managed to get over

82
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:49,740
this and as you may know this all of
these underlined underlined

83
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:56,690
words or sentences all of that had to be
implemented just to create a regular

84
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,760
season file I don't know why don't ask
me I don't want to watch our show

85
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,910
anymore

86
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:11,819
there are a few features planned if I
get the time and resources to definitely

87
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,000
implement properly OpenStack Nova
support definitely to support containers

88
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,170
so to treat VMI's like containers and
KVM will QEMU support and optimize the

89
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:32,229
hill of PowerShell that I've made other
features include licensing reminders

90
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:37,720
because you always have that one license
that never was no one thinks about and

91
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,760
then it expires and then you have a
problem and to put it all in a nice you

92
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:51,420
I definitely and 44 the end of my
presentation I have prepared a little

93
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,949
demonstration so I got a hyper-v machine
back home which is currently running

94
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:04,010
through reams and I have a master server
deployed in a data center in the UK I

95
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:13,230
will now try to create an RDP connection
to my hyper-v back home I hope it goes

96
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:25,020
well it worked ok so this is my hope you
back home as you can see I have 4 p.m.

97
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,500
through of which are running for quite
some time now

98
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:37,029
around three hours and I will now run my
python

99
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:53,690
as I said which is which is in UK

100
00:10:53,690 --> 00:11:04,440
is at the moment implemented as a
Windows service so I have to run it in

101
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:20,279
debug mode from PowerShell

102
00:11:20,279 --> 00:12:29,510
there's there's the client part of this

103
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:39,240
clients running

104
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:54,850
second there and that's it so second
okay so it's the client and it has

105
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:00,990
successfully connected to the master
which is in UK and it's finding out

106
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:13,959
something about Williams there are
currently running so as I said my

107
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,130
presentation is going to be brief and
that's all for me if you have any

108
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,589
questions please

109
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:32,899
as good now okay thank you all for ya
just one

110
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:42,050
my i really admire your because we work
together

111
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:52,910
yeah but are you aware that code you
made is proprietary and cookies owner of

112
00:13:52,910 --> 00:14:00,439
that I i talked with my superiors about
it and it is not I'm not using day of

113
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:05,179
time I'm not using their infrastructure
the idea is mine and this is just a

114
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:09,829
proof of concept ok I tried to talk

115
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:13,758
yeah just the comment

116
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,600
I'm really sad but someone needs to use
inferior solutions when someone knows

117
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:27,269
that they're much better was regarding
hi Gerry power shower and so on and so

118
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,509
on

119
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:33,660
yeah definitely definitely but we all
have our cross to bear

120
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,699
you know that is all I think you once
again for coming
