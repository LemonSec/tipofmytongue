1
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,240
hello everyone

2
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,390
welcome to the talk about practical use
of drones in everyday life so please

3
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:34,750
read our speaker and enjoyed it so my
name is the name I know and they gonna

4
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:43,970
talk about and how we can use them to
help us in our everyday life and that

5
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:50,980
that's the main topic of this talk a bit
about me I'm an entrepreneur not a

6
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,049
software developer of hardware developer
I'm or from the management side I

7
00:00:56,049 --> 00:01:03,470
finished an MBA course in Great Britain
and after that I used to work in

8
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:11,200
startups in idea style that was so I
have already co-founded to startups one

9
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,869
was a great failure on the second one
work working so it won't be a failure so

10
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:26,030
we'll see how that goes and drones are
my hobby I like to build things I like

11
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:33,210
to tinker with various hard worse so
that was something that was really

12
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,600
interesting to start doing about three
years ago that that's why I started to

13
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,740
build their own and I haven't been that
active in the drawing thing in the last

14
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:52,219
year or so because i dont have enough
time to to focus on that but my idea is

15
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:59,259
to build the start of that will have to
do something with drawings to utilize

16
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:07,170
them and commercialize in civilian way
so let's start with the presentation so

17
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,760
first of all I would like to talk about
drugs vs Robots so what what Israel but

18
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:24,160
robert is something that doesn't need
direct human interaction to work as the

19
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,109
first one who created something of of
robot or a drone

20
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:37,180
and that was remote control ship a small
one although it was like two meters long

21
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:45,250
and you can see that chip in to the
museum in belgrade later on the official

22
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:52,100
term robot was coined by Karel Capek in
1999 this that the first time that

23
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,480
somebody explain what's wrong with
relays and gave the name of of that

24
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,549
later on UNAMID was the first industrial
robot and it was built in the united

25
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:11,150
states it was used as a production robot
assembly line and I think it was later

26
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:19,120
sold to General Motors Company the
hydroelectric and about flying drones

27
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,420
the next thing is the Ryan fire be that
that's probably the first flying drone

28
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,500
that really worked you had like we want
rockets German rock is there still is

29
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,040
something of a drone

30
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:45,899
sorry yeah but it was a flying robot
it's not industrial 10 that it's Brian

31
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,430
fire be the first aerial drawn that way
aerial robot that was really successful

32
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:58,409
before that you had the SELIC we want me
two rockets and many other rock is that

33
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:03,429
worth to some part but they didn't have
much electronics and then ratify be was

34
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,560
the first one that had some computer
chip in and it worked and it was used

35
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,959
for target practice for USAir force and
later on they even use it as a spy spy

36
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:22,490
drone they made a program for that and
really flew the coop for footage is over

37
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:32,570
China and they would drop the film and
the plane would pick it up there after

38
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:41,139
that there is one of the most successful
military drones being used today it was

39
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:43,430
developed in the nineteen eighties

40
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,849
well for about 10 years and we all know
what because we had close encounters

41
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:56,960
with it a night nineteen nineties so the
main thing about this light I wanted to

42
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,229
make a difference between what is a
robot and what a drone drone is a

43
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:06,830
vehicle that goes through air or water
that's the main definition of withdrawn

44
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,620
Robert can be anything else it can be a
robot in the factory can be I don't know

45
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,810
cleaning robot or whatever but that's
the main difference between drawn sera

46
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,430
bathrooms are usually wrong but they
usually have some form of intelligence

47
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,870
artificial intelligence to control
themselves they can be completely

48
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:34,599
unmanned or they can have a pilot some
remotely located to fly them or try them

49
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:41,900
but they can also be completely unmanned
autonomous so

50
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,659
I would like to talk about type of
drawers this is just an introduction for

51
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,100
people don't know what's wrong with
robots are and they're not that used

52
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:57,900
those terms so there are three main
types of drawings that are used a mostly

53
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:04,900
in the military and I'll explain why our
focus on military that much later on so

54
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:11,299
we have fixed wing that those are
airplanes just normal airplanes there's

55
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,340
domestic one thats beggars that's
domestic fixed-wing drawn butter

56
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,289
reprogrammable hawk acceptor lots of
them every military probably in the

57
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:26,710
world has some form of an aerial drones
fixed fixed-wing drawn then we have

58
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:32,049
wrote during growth ring is a different
name for helicopters so helicopter's

59
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:39,010
rotor wing not too many of broth exists
that the road during their bit more

60
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:47,300
complicated to build so it's better to
make them and the newest ones are multi

61
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:54,990
rotor drones and that's something we
talked about and we have the first one

62
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:01,550
lockheed that's probably the first
professionally built military-grade

63
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,669
bottle thrown a threat

64
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:11,940
Canadian dragon flyer it was seven
successful thats but like that was the

65
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:18,320
first cheap probably not that cheap cost
around 30,000 euros but it was

66
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:24,229
successful and the guy sold a lot of
them for police forces and other forcing

67
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:33,669
the us- after that we have digitized 600
those are more Hobby Lobby made and

68
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:40,000
after a three hour completely homemade
models like multi V and everything

69
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,490
that's based on open-source boys like
are doing or raspberry pie or so the

70
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,680
most part is that they like trip type of
Thrones and we're going to focus on the

71
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,470
multi rotor was because those too

72
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,030
first are not that interesting because
they need they're much more expensive

73
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:09,020
and they need much more knowledge to
build so this is Ryan fighter jet engine

74
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:17,690
even this is the predator and this is i
think i dont know im queue waiting or

75
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:26,440
something like that it's it's it's
completely used by the US Air Force ok

76
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,960
so the first part of presentation
focused mainly on military ones now

77
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,590
going to talk about whatever sicilian
ones reason why a focused on the

78
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,909
military drones because they completely
dominated their space you didn't have

79
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:47,610
any civilian drones five or 10 years to
10 years ago maybe five years there was

80
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:56,360
but like the reason for that is that
technology was very expensive to build

81
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,070
the rules you need to have extreme
knowledge of a lot of things

82
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:06,140
microprocessors were very expensive
sounds or store very complicated very

83
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:13,120
expensive and mostly large so when they
start making these things like they have

84
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,990
excellent accelerometers barometer so
whatever inside of it and it's very

85
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:25,690
cheap I mean this forecast for and the
Euro so try survey ship inside so people

86
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,580
start thinking okay how can we use those
electronics to build something that can

87
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:37,450
fly that's the main thing as I said like
expensive complicated technology were to

88
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:45,730
blame that there there were no civilian
drones then used 20 so then used to go

89
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,980
ahead and attraction to Arduino
organized very simple microcontroller

90
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,320
that you can build author anything on it
so people start thinking how can we grab

91
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,800
some sound source or accelerometers from
from other devices and connect them to

92
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,859
Arduino

93
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:13,110
and use that to our airplane or multi
rotor and Geeks did that they took they

94
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:18,160
took the controller for Nintendo Wii
nunchucks because it had very sensitive

95
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,640
parameters and gyroscopes and they took
that the party took those chips and put

96
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:31,640
them on Arduino board and made the firm
that will use those data to stabilize

97
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,449
the craft the main thing was how can we
stabilize the craft through to be

98
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:46,150
however or to fly where we want wanted
to fly and that's how did so as I said

99
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:53,040
this lecture I'm gonna talk about multi
Reuters I honestly believe that way to

100
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,699
go

101
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:05,630
wiping so first of all they're very
affordable I mean you can build 1,000

102
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:13,290
1,000 euros and a good one you can build
4,000 years you can buy one for like 700

103
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:19,199
600 I dunno DJI phantom cost something
around out there it's completely usable

104
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,820
you can use it for much more than aerial
filming or aerial photography you can

105
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:32,340
use it had no to take something from
this place two different basis like five

106
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:38,210
minutes away you can transport like box
of I don't know cigarettes or medicine

107
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:43,650
that distance very easily with that so
that that's something that's very

108
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:51,150
revolutionary in that you can do that
under 1000 euros very simple to operate

109
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,520
multiple authors don't have many moving
parts they have like the only moving by

110
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,370
the heaviest motors and that that's
something very very different to an

111
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,510
airplane that has a lot of moving parts
the health insurance lapse rather's

112
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:14,339
thought that can get out of work so this
is very very simple very low maintenance

113
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:19,850
you don't need to change parts you don't
need to put oil entry to the need to put

114
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:26,579
the gasoline and they're very small they
can be sure of how many of you Salto

115
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:36,489
small ones and does bear like this they
can be Biggers much as you want and yet

116
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,350
multilateral means multi-purpose because
you can use it for like lots of

117
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:47,290
different things from geography as a
result to transportation to whatever you

118
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:55,110
want we can talk about that later so I'm
gonna go through briefly through

119
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:00,509
technical part I don't know how many of
you know how drugs work in the main part

120
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:07,930
they have the feeling that I would like
to go just very quickly through that so

121
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,649
wrong

122
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:18,259
like motor-voter law have very few and
there's probably the main list of

123
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:22,990
elements they have motors have five
control board that the brain of the

124
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:27,170
whole crafts they have motor controllers
they have batteries they have propellers

125
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:35,120
we have also a frame but that's
something I didn't put them there I saw

126
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,629
my control board as the main main board
that controls how the crowd operate

127
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:49,639
sorry behaves in the air and how it
flies it saves us from south from your

128
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:56,209
input of having him put or has some GPS
coordinates the brain tangles

129
00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:00,109
coordinator said ok I need to fly there
to fight their way to fly there and

130
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:07,929
calculates the but to do that so we can
have various input sources from the

131
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:15,550
radio that you control the GPS
barometers accelerometer sport ever that

132
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,329
that tells us where the craft is

133
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:26,569
and how it should be a usually nowadays
they're based on ARM chips because

134
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:33,790
they're very affordable the cheap and
they don't take too much power to use so

135
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:40,160
that that's a good thing before before
those type of chips is very complicated

136
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,469
to put a microchip and into the wrong
because it was consumed too much energy

137
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:53,959
and you need every bit of power to power
the Brawn so this thing changed a bit on

138
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:58,238
the upper right side that the giant
although that's probably the most

139
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:05,660
popular flight control board have it's
completely closed system you buy it and

140
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,189
it's completely public plug-and-play you
plug the motor supply batteries to plug

141
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:15,459
the radio and it works it works
fantastically its stable flies that's a

142
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:21,449
good thing I did that you can see are
doing aboard its mega bored you can use

143
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:26,209
that to build a problem there's open
source for her you can download and

144
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:32,089
upload to your Arduino board and I to
work it it will need much more tinkering

145
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:36,879
so it can fly as you want but it would
work that's probably the cheapest way to

146
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,049
build the throne but the most
time-consuming because you'll lose

147
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:51,999
probably few weeks to calibrate
everything so it works so bad three most

148
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:59,360
growth that you can build use lithium
polymer batteries they're very reliable

149
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:08,129
they're also cheap and you can find them
anywhere and they can sustain very high

150
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:13,779
loads can that's very important thing
because traditional batteries cannot

151
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:21,759
stand those big loads when you put on
them and there's bad risk can and also

152
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,240
batteries are dead

153
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,880
the bottleneck for further drawn
development because the only thing that

154
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:34,209
really limiting the drones in that way
multi rotors nowadays our flight times

155
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:40,589
if items are not more than 20 or 30
minutes usually and that's a big problem

156
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:46,720
I transport something from both return
or inside you need probably more than 30

157
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,220
minutes of flight time and that may not
like they need to find a way to make

158
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,140
batteries last longer or use some other
type of technology to provide energy for

159
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:03,990
the draw by times when motorists

160
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:09,490
very simple that they are the only
moving parts and inside of them they're

161
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:15,900
like only ball bearings so there's
nothing to break really side of their

162
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:23,709
brushless thanks to Tesla I mean that we
have those they have very high RPMs

163
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:33,040
proposed 2000 3000 rpms on on my drawn
for example that they're they're really

164
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:40,470
cheap I mean one motorist costs $15 you
can use that to build also you need

165
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:46,500
eighty 80 bucks to make a quadcopter

166
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,280
have outright speed control that that
the middleman between the control

167
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,970
between the control Flight Control Board
and the motors if it's a very important

168
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:02,690
part of the whole multi rotorcraft
because it tells the motorist how how

169
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,960
quickly they should spin and if they if
they should slow down or speed up and

170
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:14,300
depends on the position of the crowd if
you wanna go forward then then some

171
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,700
other states slowdown has some way to
speed up so that you move in that

172
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:24,740
direction they're very important and
they also act as a transformer because

173
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,170
we have batteries that RDC and lead to
transform that

174
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:37,290
electricity to AC so the voters will
spend

175
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:44,440
yeah yeah every every motor needs needs
to have a separate strike speed control

176
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,900
because that part tells that motor how
quickly it has been so if you have four

177
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:59,500
more than you need to have four yeses
and there's also a specialized for multi

178
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,330
daughter's death

179
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:06,460
k if anyone has drawn install it you can
flash the firmware on that because it's

180
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:12,900
also based on ARM chip and you can flash
really makes a difference in flight

181
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,960
because it up there

182
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:21,480
the refresh rate is much higher than
that needed 444 stability usually those

183
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,850
yes these are used in our state planes
so they don't need to have that would

184
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:32,500
refresh rate to change speed because the
plane just flies and it doesn't have to

185
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:38,170
be slower or quicker like four other
times the second and similar case made

186
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:44,680
to have a refresh rate of water it hurts
so that other times a second it changes

187
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:55,230
the speed of the engine so the water so
little bit about mechanics free access

188
00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:03,630
pitch and roll Jesse and as always said
movement is adjustable changed our plans

189
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:08,870
to speed of the rotation of the motors
to show move forward you need to slow

190
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:16,179
down the forward motorists and speed up
the back ones so it'll till and the same

191
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,720
thing if you want to move up or down you
need to slow down all of them speed up

192
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,830
all of them or retaliation rotation is
betting thrusting because you slow down

193
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:32,310
counter voters so that torque of because
they spent in opposite directions so I

194
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:36,980
slowed down to operate ones you have
higher torque on one or the other side

195
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,540
so it goes by torque

196
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,020
ok so now we come to the main part of
this lecture

197
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:54,450
I i would like to ask questions share
your ideas or whatever that's how I

198
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,610
imagine this this lecture i dont wanna
talk all the time I want to hear your

199
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:09,679
ideas so what do you think is the main
use of civilian drones nowadays does

200
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:19,860
anyone have an idea yeah I think ninety
percent of Thrones that was told today

201
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:31,729
by the gyre any other brand are used for
fun or $4 fee and that's like that's the

202
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:38,810
main commercial part of the wrong in
2015 which I felt cells draws 44

203
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:45,540
photography and that set they don't do
anything else or for hobby for playing

204
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:50,899
outside I mean if you're kidding her
like 15 years very cool to have the

205
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:56,410
wrong side and back out and that's okay
but that's not the real commercial value

206
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:03,160
of of multi rotor drawings I really
believe that that's not the main that it

207
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:09,830
shouldn't be too to play with it or to
film something to film a wedding so

208
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:21,620
whatever that that's cool I think that's
good I saw fewer races and that's very

209
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:30,800
interesting but I don't know how they
fly line like that but it's cool ok so

210
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:37,860
this I think has the highest value for
commercialization in the drawn industry

211
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:44,429
and that's transportation very big
companies flee the AHL around and Amazon

212
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:52,970
are very interested in that and they
invest a lot of money to to make the

213
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,790
wrong that can be used for
transportation they don't invest a lot

214
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:02,409
of money in the technology they invest a
lot of money in Los they want to change

215
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:08,950
the laws so that the law will allow them
to have transportation rose last year I

216
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:15,680
was on the web summit in Dublin and I
met the guy who has very successful

217
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:25,060
company building drones and he is part
of a group that consists of Google DHL

218
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:30,629
Amazon arrived know who else that
lobbying in the USA to change the laws

219
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:36,470
about the drawing industry so so it's a
very very big thing they invest a lot of

220
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:42,830
money they have very influential people
in the USA not that that is trying to

221
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:50,830
change that and allow them to completely
freely use drugs for patients so that's

222
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:57,020
probably one of the biggest things that
happen in the next few years that will

223
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:03,090
see a transportation trolls everywhere
around us probably not here but in the

224
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:11,209
us- it will be like that the next thing
that that's very interesting for me is

225
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:19,860
social rescue dogs I haven't heard about
them successful operation about social

226
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:34,100
rescued at that use drones I don't know
if any one of you heard but we had

227
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:45,139
yeah but I think that our guests also
has that they bought but I renting the

228
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,190
use of you had like situation last year

229
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:53,140
flooding floods in a brand are they
using I know a guy who went with the

230
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:58,360
wrong there he's told the commander ok I
can make

231
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:07,189
elite footage of the whole area just let
me get through the roadblocks and they

232
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:15,549
said no we don't either so and they did
it I mean it's very needed it's quick

233
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:21,150
cheap it doesn't cost a thing it was
about three that you can recharge so

234
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:25,270
they don't use it

235
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:34,110
ok but you can save lives so it doesn't
really it's not that important so that

236
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:41,030
doesn't cost a million dollars it costs
500 euros that's a thing that my phone

237
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:47,149
costs more than that that's nothing and
but they don't use it I don't know why

238
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:55,130
probably there's no one came to them
with a year using it they probably

239
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:01,370
thought this would be cool and they buy
one and no one no one flies flies it and

240
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:08,449
no one knows how to fly it and knows how
to deploy quickly and that's also very

241
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,669
important thing about constant
commercialization of multi rotor

242
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:19,049
aircraft I believe that there's a good
chance to build build drones that can be

243
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:25,559
used by firemen by police penned by
guest as guess as to how to translate

244
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:32,740
the mouth Rescue Service they're very
into search-and-rescue missions because

245
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:39,330
they're probably the most ready
structure of the whole emergency teams

246
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,960
that for those kind of situation

247
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:52,310
so I i believe that you can create a
startup you can create you can develop

248
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:58,190
their own that could be used in those
type of situations especially if it's

249
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:06,580
linked to a cloud server or whatever and
all the necessary teams that need to see

250
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:13,590
can see in real time with happening so
fireman ambulances police whoever needs

251
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,570
to see can login and see real-time
what's happening and that's something

252
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:27,620
that people should think about 30 many
drawings this this is very interesting

253
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:36,389
because a friend of mine he studies the
course that university communities to

254
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:44,820
death in Holland their own and they
build madrone they just with just the

255
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:52,929
concepts they built something like two
weeks and it has heart battles

256
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:59,260
refrigerator inside of it so if somebody
has heart attack they can flight and you

257
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:06,580
can revive that person without the wrong
just the cost if they don't know if that

258
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:15,350
will work on the large scale but still
second I saw a concept of the wrong it's

259
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:21,399
bigger it's like not a small rise much
larger but is used to transport patients

260
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:27,000
can put one stretch and one patient in
it and I can fly very quickly to the

261
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,050
hospital is completely open and so if
there's traffic accident we can put that

262
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:36,530
person that drone flights hospital in no
time

263
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:46,680
that's also something that you talk
about their own mapping and geographic

264
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,410
information system that's also very
interesting thing it's already used in

265
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:54,990
that industry not that much because

266
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:02,320
in some ways fixed-wing drawn so much
easier to using that because you need a

267
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,590
long flight times but still some some
companies use the use of drones for

268
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:16,770
mapping in for its very quick to deploy
if you need to see something so why not

269
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:25,490
and you can mount I dunno rather of
whatever infrared sensors on it and you

270
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:32,880
can see a lot of things about the ground
that you're scanning

271
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:40,330
yeah you need the a uniquely space even
if it's bigger than either runway or

272
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:50,260
whatever so it's much more complicated
deploy can put this yeah exactly you can

273
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:59,540
put this back of the truck just take it
out and provide this damage control is

274
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:05,870
something that's very connected to
search and rescue I don't know why put

275
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:14,500
it in my head it's different because
damage control is more about or scanning

276
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:21,910
some some I rebuilding after a fire to
see how damaged this I mean you can scan

277
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:27,190
the roof you can see that something that
you need probably three or four man and

278
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:33,510
fire firemen drug to get up on the roof
and see how that is this we can do that

279
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:40,670
in like five minutes time with the wrong
make a video it takes footage and you

280
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:44,590
can you can you can see what what
happened so that something will damage

281
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:52,620
control could be connected with the
search and rescue but doesn't have to be

282
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,919
the last one is videography does the
main use of drones day I don't want to

283
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,360
talk about that too much because
probably everyone's

284
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:08,149
wedding photographer had the wrong or
you solve their own some beer fest

285
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:18,110
involving those were ever so so people
use that mainly for that this is just a

286
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:22,760
very random image from Ventura three
kids he uses drawn to transport whatever

287
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:31,750
just a joke but this one is not job this
is Amazon Prime air and it's very good i

288
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:38,510
mean they built very simply it's very
cheap to build and the box full of books

289
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:44,000
that whole and in front of your house
when you order them and this is the

290
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:53,640
concept of that may be drawn so it's a
bit larger the motors fold up and you

291
00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:00,179
put the stretch and the person in their
closest and motorists come down and it

292
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:08,460
will fly to the nearest hospital so
that's the idea that ok I would like to

293
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:14,610
talk about market size because I from
the startup ecosystem and it's very

294
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:24,178
important for me to do see that people
have good ideas to spread that a

295
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:29,150
consistent a special serbia were very
very small ecosystems is not too much

296
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:37,050
startups and I want to tell you that
there's very good opportunities for

297
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:44,290
Jones you can trade the start of having
a good idea and you could probably be

298
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:50,340
part of that large market did you have
for example is the biggest phone company

299
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:58,120
today was just University starts at
seven years to 6 years ago like three

300
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,669
students from some Chinese University
try to build something and they're very

301
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,820
big they're worth

302
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:12,100
you see the grass and so in 2015 the
whole market for civilian drones are not

303
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,709
talking about $3 because that's
something a little different

304
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:24,720
six billion dollars of that I guess that
90% is the GI maybe not like about

305
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,820
eighty percent for sure is Asia and they
sell drugs for hobby for videography

306
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:36,919
whatever plug and play them and they do
it good people really buy their drawings

307
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:45,470
so and then I think special role so i
dont no choice honestly but they do fly

308
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:52,320
and they defy good I suppose that he has
a degree i buy also used the GFI

309
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,280
controls so they're good but their toys
you can build something much more better

310
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,810
than that

311
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:07,540
surely so here's the graft from Agence I
don't think this is actually completely

312
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:14,969
through graph because you can see some
racial this is military drones and this

313
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:20,189
is civilian drones so military drones
are definitely the largest part of the

314
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:24,950
market and that's something that it's
not easy to tap into because you need to

315
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:31,250
have contracts with military forces to
create something special for them to

316
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,300
sell them it's very complicated
complicated to get into that business

317
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:40,620
but civilian drones or something
completely different people can still

318
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:45,799
make a stock that make a drone or sell
it to the public or to the firefighters

319
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:54,640
to the police and money from that and
make a good living ok probably the last

320
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,339
part of all of this is that I always
said that the typical drawn is cheaper

321
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:06,340
than an iPhone and everyone has an
iPhone so everyone can have a drone and

322
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:12,670
that means that you can tomorrow that
you have like million drones and Sophia

323
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:17,470
that could be a very problematic thing I
mean if have million the wrong serbia

324
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:23,589
you probably will have 500,000 people
tomorrow because people by those they

325
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:28,130
don't know how to fight and they will
crash it into the first car or person or

326
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:39,780
whatever so there needs to be some form
of legislation law that will control all

327
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:47,079
of that and my opinion is that it's very
important to have a good good

328
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:54,329
legislation and good control over those
types of crafts because they're not toys

329
00:35:54,329 --> 00:36:02,770
even that I all I said their toys
they're not always there like flying to

330
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:11,250
kilo stones I mean if you don't know how
to fly them there's no one has to do

331
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:19,230
whatever it may make damage serious
damage so not everyone should have the

332
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:25,990
wrong that definitely I would let most
of the people in serbia operate draws

333
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:32,180
you operate I would let them because
they're completely not conscious of

334
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,859
where they're flying how they're flying
in how much damage that type of flying

335
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:44,190
and can make other people so more and
more countries are into introducing some

336
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:52,780
form of their own laws dus probably the
first one who did it and they're also

337
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:58,630
the most restrictive because it's very
hard to legally own a drawn and operated

338
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:06,559
on in the us- ranks the same as flying
sport airplane you need to have the same

339
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:15,170
type of license to 25 drawn as you would
find that point that's a good thing the

340
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,480
other day Lapointe

341
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,859
think that's very expensive and if I buy
a drawn that cost 1000 euros why would

342
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:28,609
any better doesn't have a license for
that but still you need to know the laws

343
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:36,259
that are used in their aerospace
industry that is used by airplane pilots

344
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:41,320
you need to know that you need to know
some general laws of physics concerned

345
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:48,080
with with flying and that's very
important thing but still Serbia is also

346
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:55,009
introducing a law in a month's time it's
not that restrictive you need to pass

347
00:37:55,010 --> 00:38:01,980
some tests so they can see that you're
at least mentally normal to operate

348
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,970
something that can potentially be deadly

349
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:11,859
so that's a good thing by my opinion I
didn't read the law completely in detail

350
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:21,140
but I saw the bullets its ok sounds ok
some forms of controller necessary the

351
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:26,859
main problem is that you cannot actually
control the wrong except who's buying it

352
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:33,299
and does does the person who's buying it
have any type of license for that

353
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:39,640
because you cannot see them on the radar
there too small to see to be seen on the

354
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:47,629
Raider you cannot track them that is
they use three questions that are open

355
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,290
to the general public

356
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:58,100
most of them use 2.4 gigahertz that same
frequency here's why does so some forms

357
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:04,259
of control are very necessary as trust
that that that people who have the wrong

358
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,050
should take

359
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:10,710
really good care of how they operate
them because it could be a deadly weapon

360
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:21,790
and yeah coming today at potential
problems and dangers thankfully there

361
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:29,460
wasn't too many cases of some global
scale some serious damage with drones

362
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,380
we're talking about serious we're not
talking about children's that our

363
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:39,020
military that do make a lot of the
damage and killed a lot of people

364
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:44,980
yearly and most of people agree that
that's completely unethical to have a

365
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:52,120
pile sitting ten thousand kilometers in
a box in either killing other people

366
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:58,910
Afghanistan true joystick and the screen
so we're talking with ross we don't have

367
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:05,560
like three days 4 days ago we had like a
strong crash in the you s open but hurt

368
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:13,880
anyone I just crashed it on the on the
US Open match but we had situations

369
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:19,350
serbia the beginning of the year there
was divided between Serbia and Albania

370
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:27,380
and the albanians brought DJI phantom
with the flag of the big albania

371
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:34,140
whatever it's called and that you cannot
you couldn't control that you couldn't

372
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:39,170
do anything about it because you cannot
shoot drawn it's very hard to hit the

373
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:44,330
wrong because you have you need to hit
propeller motor so it will go down so

374
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:48,790
you can just sit and watch what's
happening and thanks Stefan literature

375
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:51,910
to the flag down but still i mean if you
didn't do that you put you wouldn't be

376
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:59,060
able to do anything you just watch so
that's a big problem that you cannot

377
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:05,400
control it you can just try to control
who owns it and how it how he operated

378
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,810
educate him but there's one thing and

379
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:16,670
this is this something that probably get
some form of black lace terrorist watch

380
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:26,110
whatever you could put to kill a bomb on
to draw could put 24 to kill so C four

381
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:32,190
is the equivalent of normal camera that
you put on the J phantom and that is

382
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:39,610
true how much kills of DND probably 240
and he could tear this whole place down

383
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,620
in an instant

384
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:49,359
you could put that easily on a roll and
flight five kilometers away from you and

385
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:56,990
just shooting into a house or building
or Parliament or whatever and that's

386
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:03,430
think tank thanks to God they didn't
happen yet but I honestly believe it

387
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:08,669
will happen very soon because terrorists
also know how to use the internet and

388
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:13,680
they know how to buy things online and
like put those things together you have

389
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:24,049
like very cheap very effective killing
machine and probably because parking is

390
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:33,130
a lot of our Privacy important thing
about wrongs they can be used to gather

391
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:41,310
illegal surveillance about anyone of us
you couldn't probably there's some very

392
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:47,320
silent once I haven't seen Silence roles
but probably there the military has a

393
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,750
flight to Windows Taylor like 45 minutes
of what you're lis inside probably

394
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:58,850
wouldn't be able to notice it you
wouldn't be able to hear it so they

395
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:05,580
could be used together surveillance
that's something that

396
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:13,500
should also be controlled but again I
don't do that legally so that that's

397
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,250
something that people should also think
about one thing about drones is that

398
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:23,610
every time you fly you probably on the
GoPro cameras have you probably feel

399
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:30,180
something that somebody will mind you
having it so that that's something that

400
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:38,230
shows about that's about privacy so if
there's million rooms because many

401
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:43,430
people can buy them tomorrow we don't
have any privacy at all from there we

402
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:48,259
don't have any privacy anyway but still
should try to keep that kind of privacy

403
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:57,140
as much as we can and that will be it
from my side so I would like to see if

404
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:04,368
anyone has questions I guess there's
some people who have questions

405
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:12,349
unfortunately not there is drawn on the
desk outside but the batteries are not

406
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:18,900
charged $5 bodies yeah he could travel
where you could bring the small ones

407
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:25,509
here yeah

408
00:44:25,509 --> 00:44:32,349
and we have some small ones that we can
fly inside if the batteries are charged

409
00:44:32,349 --> 00:44:37,079
any other question

410
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:54,330
arrival of the draw

411
00:44:54,330 --> 00:45:10,610
educate the better than they probably
will fight them to the field near the

412
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:19,840
small one and this one costs around 40
50 euros forty years I don't know you're

413
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:35,060
better than that

414
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:41,340
and this one is very safe because it's
like the proposed that hired them even

415
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:50,660
if they hit you heard that much

416
00:45:50,660 --> 00:46:13,930
well we didn't practice for this so
probably will need more before training

417
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:35,240
