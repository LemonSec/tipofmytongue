1
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:28,329
next dog is don't lie to me and I hope
Alex not a liar and his gracious man

2
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:42,120
let's start sure about social engineer
hello welcome engineering talk more in

3
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,899
but basically they asked me for doing us
otherwise we would get on top of a

4
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:53,680
crypto talk which is even more boring so
the question is Who Am I

5
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:02,360
dollar and a marker and part RFC hacker
someone who figure 6 salts and Michael

6
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,850
things happen so whenever you're gonna
be asked to ask what is a hacker there's

7
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:20,630
r/c for its so you can lay down and
relax I'm a German and we have to the

8
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,679
nice lady

9
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:30,119
Chancellor and we want to talk today
about the nonverbal communication

10
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:39,350
because when we talk to each other only
70% a 7% is made by warts the rest of

11
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,759
this body position gestures

12
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:51,939
blink your eyes are you look at the
person movements and the way your sit

13
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:58,258
move and sure enough micro expressions
in this case I wouldn't call it my cross

14
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:05,469
questions I would call it Michael
expressions so the question is when the

15
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:10,530
body language so much involved why don't
we know so much about it and the answer

16
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,860
is B to everybody of use an expert on
body language only think what we're

17
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:23,370
liking us sometimes we do not pay
attention when we should do but anyone

18
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,069
of you guys it's an expert on body
language and that said I would say

19
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:35,069
I'm here not to lecture you I'm here to
intact so to talk to you

20
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,810
ok so just a small village into action
here and with questions and answers me

21
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:49,530
putting myself about you are giving you
a talk on lecture so body language can

22
00:02:49,530 --> 00:03:14,760
do a lot of things I need to change the
display

23
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:23,120
quite see that body language there was
not one word spoken every one of you

24
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,920
understood what happens right right or
not

25
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,250
yeah just over for me that's we we do
this together only have 16 slight so we

26
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:39,120
have to build a time before into action
instead of just talking right so why is

27
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,180
that so our brain functions a little bit
different then we may be Fink words are

28
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,239
made by the neocortex which has two new
contacts new which means when you

29
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,230
collect your mind and your finger and
your talk and you convince people from

30
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:04,099
things you use your words and your
choose your words wisely when you want

31
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:07,909
to order a contract or convince somebody
that you want to let you into company

32
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:13,239
even though he's got so you choose your
words wisely but there's also a little

33
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:19,769
opponent and that's here the limbic
system we have a little finger and the

34
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:25,880
brain was called the LA and it's quite
hard to train that think once a body

35
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,409
movements you need like 50,000 movements
to get it back to you

36
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:35,639
limbic system so when you do one more
than 50,000 times you've got a chance to

37
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,229
bring this interview limbic system
that's used most commonly it by the door

38
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:45,909
styles like I Q tal carter also much so
these guys can react much faster than

39
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,210
weekend because they don't use the
neocortex and the same gonna happen when

40
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,109
you start talking to people

41
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,720
systems gon act even though you don't
want it to act and you show expressions

42
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,560
even though you don't want to show his
expressions so therefore you should

43
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,820
understand that does that our brain as
not just making up by ourselves all

44
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:18,270
works but we have more what we do so we
show signals of power and light body

45
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:23,128
positions possible sensuous like look at
this to people

46
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:27,469
what does it say to you if you look at
these people what is what does this

47
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:34,360
position say to you any ideas

48
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:48,289
here let's try not to go to detail what
they discussed but what we see I think

49
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:56,229
of blood amid Putin described the price
of gas but the weather there could be

50
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:04,610
other ideas that could be it's a very
firm position and show you the power and

51
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,680
the other hand angle america is also
trying to convince that seized power

52
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,800
button on her face you can see this
action yes that is very good that's

53
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,330
actually good recognized you see here
almost an animal power he's like a

54
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:28,318
bodybuilder his stance their shoulders
back just like military one can tell

55
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:38,009
he's sort of the military ones he looks
down say he looks down to her why she is

56
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:39,969
not convinced about what she's doing

57
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:46,839
look at her face so that's quite good
example for some people standing deer

58
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,949
and I think that wasn't about the gas of
us about that people and some kind of

59
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:57,099
war and she told least not convinced
about being herself over there in this

60
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:02,580
era so that means I just like sample
you're perfectly see how you can play

61
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:10,039
out power to somebody just a few
position of the body even better is this

62
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:16,878
example dunno American French year was
just doing any idea what he's doing

63
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,390
there

64
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:38,200
know he's spreading her dude that was
nice of you to talk you did it right I

65
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,390
told you have to do just talk this way
it's very good that's what you get and

66
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,200
you'll see that if you look at
politicians you see that all the time

67
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,520
they tried to pat each other and become
the upper hand staged a try to place a

68
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,020
smaller place and yes that's one common
common example everybody doesn't want to

69
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:03,169
talk about this because that is a very
important to us sir all try to play out

70
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:08,010
your power and justice different
cultures and if you look at different

71
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,880
cultures day as this one example of what
everybody would draw when you talk about

72
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:18,380
body expressions and about playing out
power which is camp david 2000 anyone

73
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:24,680
knows it's one we had some peace
negotiations between some people who

74
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,740
don't really love each other one of the
parts of the people there was two guys

75
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,390
palestinian and other people which is
really don't love each other the guys

76
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:40,770
from Israel to kind of disagreements
with each other and let me just show you

77
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:47,050
a little video which ensures you hold
power play actually can get even worse

78
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:53,780
BC as prime minister Israel withdrew
from southern lebanon

79
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,100
took part in the Camp David summit in
2000 but failed to resolve the

80
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:06,260
israeli-palestinian conflict this was
all over the world now we're in the

81
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,069
Western world we try to be polite way of
letting somebody else into the door

82
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,300
first but does Middle East it took a
little bit different

83
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:22,930
which means when I'm the boss of the
house I got you into my house and is a

84
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:30,189
classic example the almost wrestling
over there very funny do its so you see

85
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,690
already there's this party position

86
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:38,830
I want to be the last one moving in I
shoveled other one over there so he

87
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:44,020
touch you on the armed private become
the upper guy and you just spin around

88
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,670
and touch him on the arm and push him in
and stuff like this so you're definitely

89
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,469
see that they have to a little wrestling

90
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:58,450
we all laughing about it but I was no
laughing matter what time I guess and I

91
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:05,580
think they fucked up a little peace
negotiations we see that go back

92
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:18,750
here's another thing which is nice what
you see here we see two people shaking

93
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:28,730
hands right but what do you see I mean
this time miss michael has the upper

94
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:39,100
hand it's not putting this time she's
looking down and what else issue touring

95
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:56,780
right she's pushing the president

96
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:14,319
hello my friend what do you see here I
have to operate and I moved out of the

97
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:23,080
strong position in a weaker position
even though he's bigger than me I moved

98
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,940
him into a weaker position so that's
what Michael does she doesn't quiets

99
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:39,600
obviously so the guy here that helps a
lot of the guys year he is very

100
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,949
they all trained for media so what she
instantly did he's moving back why is

101
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:52,380
moving back because they don't want us
to look like this on a camera he wants

102
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,319
to be bigger so he moving is moving back
and she did it the right way she comes

103
00:11:57,319 --> 00:12:02,469
from uptown and chance to hand a little
bit so she got the upper hand which you

104
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:11,440
might know from whatever but that's the
way it is that's classic tell basically

105
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,579
it's good when somebody

106
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:22,560
military position when you walk to
somebody standing like this what

107
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,479
position does he have

108
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:49,779
and scored big on in there but what else
does it show you're not scared

109
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:54,170
and the first moment I would not say so
in the SEC moment you're right but in

110
00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:00,219
the first moment I wouldn't say so
because he expose this is a test which

111
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:06,720
means I'm honest I'm standing like this
as a military personnel I'm saving you

112
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,930
on I'm exposing my chest I'm exposing my
whole body some of my Japanese soldier

113
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,920
would approach you in the old days like
this you would have a sense here and he

114
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,748
would approach you like this that looks
funny but you got to spend here onto

115
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:28,350
cannot attack him because he's instantly
moving so yeah spots as you're right

116
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:38,499
that he is he is reassuring himself here
this position itself tapping you see

117
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:49,910
people doing this you see people doing
this this nervous about some self

118
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:55,029
tapping this like it will be ok that's
like my muscles as well be ok as the

119
00:13:55,029 --> 00:14:00,319
same you when your self tapping out here
in your self tapping that means to try

120
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:05,949
to get your numbers the tea down by why
should you be nervous when everything is

121
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:13,000
fine so if you get somebody answer your
question a person for an instance like

122
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:22,740
say you are and the investigator and the
guy sitting like this and you asked him

123
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:29,839
did you kill this lady was like nope
that's most likely that he's he's right

124
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:44,179
by the acts as a female position or my
legs are already trying to get out of

125
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:51,470
position I'm not really I'm not really
ok with this position would like to move

126
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:59,449
away so I'm sitting not just like this
say my chance to see the people up there

127
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:01,810
so we play a little bit

128
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,969
though the guy is sitting like this have
a sense here and just Lexus foot the

129
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:15,050
struggling a little bit not directly are
not like typically Italian body language

130
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:26,040
by the language is that Italian better
though the typical language when you win

131
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:36,750
something how does it look like when you
win like in sports right even if you

132
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:42,580
don't participate at the sport but
you'll have good hearts 411 team she was

133
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:51,380
raised up your hands because they went
right so actually the Japanese kanji for

134
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:59,390
big is the person who stands like this
that's a Japanese kanji for die or key

135
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,860
what do you think that the country would
be for something small

136
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:12,550
just almost not possible right and
country country countryside

137
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:19,579
simplifications conscious is actually
the Japanese system from the talking as

138
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:26,850
means Chinese writing kanji so what
could be one this is all key pick what

139
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:38,150
could be the opposite what

140
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:44,780
how to draw always finger conscious
somewhat arrived at this position to

141
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:54,290
really feel strong when you walk like
this i really right so persistent body

142
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,730
position and the little movement
together you can either first of all

143
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:06,140
what you never can do you can never say
this person is lying that's bullshit you

144
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:12,030
only can say his body is not interacting
the forties saying so there's a

145
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:17,980
difference between like that martin say
oh he's living a lie detector on yet I

146
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,190
fought on so it made a big needle think
I know he's lying that's not going to

147
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:27,230
work so you have to look at all the
aspects not just one aspect you have to

148
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:33,700
look at all the aspects when you wanna
see if the person is telling the truth

149
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:39,070
or if you wanna wanna feel what the
person really thinks so we had to solve

150
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:46,020
touch front nixon over there we have
moving out as I was just explains one

151
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:54,780
you already moving out as same as mine
and somebody approach and is approaching

152
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:02,110
you and you move out so you don't feel
comfortable with the situation than we

153
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:07,820
have had shaking you see this really
want somebody is perfectly normal to see

154
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:13,360
little checks like this they really fast
and stay here see you there really fast

155
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,189
you should have two tone of the voice
when somebody's not sure about me saying

156
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:28,010
sometimes to voice cracks in there but
you cannot yes yes yes yes go go go go

157
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:37,379
daytime it's ok outside sunglasses on
nighttime or inside the building it's

158
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:43,800
not ok just person don't want you to
Rita's ice same as when we talk to each

159
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,540
other and I talked like this

160
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,379
cost can you just give me whatever that
is not really and you're really serious

161
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:58,070
on people doing so then the little girl
and boy stands you know what I'm

162
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:08,800
thinking about little girls stant anyone
got an idea of what I mean who looking

163
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:40,139
at the floor what else inside come and
show us that are most perfect thank you

164
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:53,720
both so we have two little girls not
bother the little boys don't have to

165
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:02,230
drink it doesn't think like alcohol
abuse of your float away no good old are

166
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:08,200
you alright I keep it for you for the
next one

167
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:17,890
what I want knows I got a whole bottle
come up what little boys that what about

168
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:27,490
this right so you're seeing somebody
making some small are looking up making

169
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,390
have some smaller looking up because it
didn't mistaken tried to convince her to

170
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:37,400
do that you don't want to punish a riot
and people do this automatically nothing

171
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,260
what they do

172
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:43,070
long breaks and talking except the
Japanese language I would say in almost

173
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:48,090
any language a long breaks and talking
when we had a real conversation means

174
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,810
this person is exactly putting his words
actually in Japanese as the same but

175
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,909
since the languages can sometimes be
difficult you'll hear there's a lot that

176
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:05,290
people say and then you have a break and
then some one day they go ahead of the

177
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:10,139
language of the conversation but in this
case because there's language really

178
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,560
easy to misunderstand what you want to
tell but in our language when somebody

179
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,980
does long breaks when you ask them some
what you should know instantly then he's

180
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:24,080
preparing answer I don't say is
preparing allies preparing an answer

181
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:30,939
when he takes long breaks what else we
help moving head up and down by moving

182
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:37,850
the head down like you don't want to be
seen shaking moving out

183
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:47,219
sure we have to have a position as a
tell what is actually frightening if you

184
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,570
go to Faisal expressions what is
frightening what what's scare someone

185
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:59,830
there what is stare

186
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:10,580
yes but what is staring

187
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:18,210
try to save a little bit more that's a
sign matter what is staring staring is

188
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:23,760
the lack of facial expressions staring
at nothing else than the lacked a facial

189
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,990
expressions so I don't smile to you I
just look at you and Japanese because

190
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,480
this Mets game like this so I don't have
a special at all and i dont hate you I

191
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,480
don't like you are just be empty their
season Bhutto one day when they perform

192
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,669
together let's say that's why he's
attacking me I do movement pushing back

193
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:55,880
now over and we look at each other like
this and he instantly wants to go back

194
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,429
that's the lack of facial expressions
and Japanese the Mets game it's very

195
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:04,850
important to understand that we are
ready

196
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:13,129
interprets the light off an expression
as an aggression I did not look mean I

197
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:17,000
don't make like are such like like like
liking

198
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,909
just walk away so I wasn't pissed and
that's the point where you get scared to

199
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:28,750
person is not pissed that's when he
becomes dangerous what else do we go we

200
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:34,760
tried to establish rapport with the
audience whether as this does anyone

201
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:51,920
else you know what a poor means what

202
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:59,070
doing so good you're saving me some
homework it's basically the phrase from

203
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:04,250
your own programming and its use in
sales and marketing of course only now

204
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:09,190
all situations where you can when you
should negotiate basically it's kind of

205
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:14,940
cycle synchronization of body language
and facial expressions also you can you

206
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,040
can also synchronize your language with
the language of the person you're

207
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,460
talking to you can use the same words
and you can get into the loop with a

208
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:28,810
mind and then you can make your phone's
that's where so important except a

209
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:33,850
communication direct communication where
is this important emails sales

210
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:41,730
negotiation negotiations what's a loan
type forces I cannot do hypothesis with

211
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,990
someone when I don't have reported him
so if you want to happen still I need

212
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:53,020
help or if i dont have all I cannot do
an induction right so that's very

213
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:57,670
important report she tried to help
people to relax or whatever if you don't

214
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,900
have helped all you cannot see you
cannot entire time

215
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:09,059
well as well as it's important to have
up or

216
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:26,668
no one drinking presentations yes where
else where else fighting it is

217
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:31,360
impossible to fight when you get
attacked it is impossible to find when

218
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,269
you don't have a poor of our top or if
you don't have a communication to the

219
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:42,399
one who is attacking you cannot fight so
that is no good for you to defense will

220
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:48,039
be done that's why you need help or 21
ultimately needs expressions from the

221
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:56,629
hot what isn't expression from the heart
are you see some politicians I tell you

222
00:25:56,629 --> 00:26:07,730
I will I promise you to teach you things
for reasons because i dont quotation

223
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:12,659
marks just put something in there closed
but I just want the heart plus a gesture

224
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:18,889
to talk is like the Japanese greeting
france ceded with different for us to

225
00:26:18,889 --> 00:26:21,508
talk then the gesture but we do it

226
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:29,929
yeah the Japanese like Japanese wait but
politician way as I want the best for

227
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:38,809
you I want to pass off you want your
money for reasons because I can raising

228
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:45,059
eyebrow you see this all the time you do
it all the time it implies so much when

229
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:52,580
somebody raises his eyebrows like really
right and sure enough what I really like

230
00:26:52,580 --> 00:27:16,039
it's just on the beat up I did you want
to do a perfect you say well talk I

231
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:18,530
truly believe that

232
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:27,940
because the movement just comes split
second before the talk right and that's

233
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:33,990
like saying the deaths due to fund
america is the cigar do it's clinton he

234
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:38,650
actually did that all the time but one
time he did it wrong

235
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:48,730
no you didn't watch the speech is that
this all the time and we will do it

236
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:55,180
together we don't look in the past we
look at the future right actually I

237
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,060
think that elected

238
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:19,470
done what does it tell it to you what do
you think what is he thinking

239
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:28,909
sign that's on TV and Germany first
channel and that means of London means

240
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:33,659
that is like a talk show where people
ask questions so what do you think about

241
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:41,039
this picture she definitely do not like
this question rights that's it seems to

242
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:46,830
be a very uncomfortable question and
these guys this purchase they all have

243
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:53,120
training how to to actively media and
she's almost perfect because what she

244
00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:07,658
always does she always only that she
cannot do mistakes she's just standing

245
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:14,000
there like this and it would have a
meaning when she was doing it one time

246
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,720
but she's doing it all the time so you
can tell right that's normal behavior so

247
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,789
it is really quite uncommon when she's
moving you better tell when she's doing

248
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:33,120
something then when she's not doing
anything so I sure enough what was the

249
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:43,820
Town Hall brawl right yeah I was raced
and we gots year this yes and you can

250
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,970
tell when somebody is doing this most of
the time did you not enjoy what you're

251
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:54,909
just it's also so this is actually a
total disappointment whatever question

252
00:29:54,909 --> 00:30:04,909
was asked our finger was a question

253
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:13,940
as I set this dude is doing this all the
time of the beach convince people what

254
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:23,210
is wrong on this picture ideas

255
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:51,750
that's right rocky rock shop 2.0 10 30
points of the seven we just a test on

256
00:30:51,750 --> 00:31:42,010
that post always drink alone

257
00:31:42,010 --> 00:32:28,600
go back to work

258
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:42,310
I do not think so clinton was trained to
to speak but way before he started his

259
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:46,340
career he was very self-assured and you
could throw any question that the

260
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:51,580
clinton's he was in a flick of a second
answer so he had a very very well media

261
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:58,679
training already 1990 91 so he was very
good trained by what you say is right if

262
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,180
I look at you and I might like this
there's no I'm talking to this I'm

263
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:10,500
talking to you this is not i'm talking
to you it's like a dozen catch me like

264
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:24,300
anybody catch me while i'm saying so
very good gets you get your drink

265
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:32,020
especially meaningful looking away from
what you're saying you try to to go away

266
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:48,550
and you look in the other direction yes
here's my friends thank you thats all

267
00:33:48,550 --> 00:34:11,418
the problems of that promise

268
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:20,549
totally convinced that he's doing the
best thing for america right so he said

269
00:34:20,549 --> 00:34:27,889
and the end I did never lie but he did
not say I don't have sex with this woman

270
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:36,470
is that I did not have sex with these
women and have a light is the perfect

271
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:40,408
example politicians is always good if
you want to catch someone lying because

272
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:46,339
then you you treat yourself good to have
media training until I all the time it's

273
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:52,239
a job description so you have to perfect
examples and he's not quite good liar

274
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:57,250
he's like almost perfect in this job
right let me see how many slides we got

275
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:08,309
yes Japanese half and Monday fight with
each other to have a rule which caused

276
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:14,589
my anybody know what that could mean yes
the right distance to the opponents and

277
00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:19,369
a Japanese when you fight a theme you
got to run your talk when I want to talk

278
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:26,869
to cost stands here and maybe no goods
if I want to talk to costs I would go

279
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:39,460
directly here and talk to him to really
talk to cost question if I know if I

280
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:45,410
know something whatever

281
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:59,640
I don't want to give you the answer like
they are you doing after moving out some

282
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:04,359
people do its buy without even notice
that they raised their soldiers either

283
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:10,280
revolt over both even saying something
else when somebody is saying something

284
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,350
is bodies not correspond and I think we
basically the message I wanna bring over

285
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,920
if the body is no corresponding what is
guy is saying

286
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,180
chances are high that that's what he's
saying somebody's meaning so when I say

287
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:39,790
I don't know that means in real that's
twenty years ago maybe like this

288
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:43,670
when somebody like like me like a clown
dumpling of running around to the states

289
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:48,680
that means basically nothing that means
he's not comfortable standing in one

290
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:55,850
spot you cannot buy somebody moving back
and forth saying what does guys thinking

291
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,990
what you can do it why he's talking like
it's over I'm talking to you like this

292
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:06,669
we have a serious discussion and I want
to talk to you and I want to punish you

293
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:13,030
for whatever you did that is maybe not
swatches and someone I mean done so

294
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,930
thats you always see to two ways either
somebody's giving presentation why do

295
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:23,129
you walk on presentations anybody know
why we on body language why would I walk

296
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:36,600
on presentations to fucked up to be
nervous if the person he proposed yet

297
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:48,140
another rocky up all the people across
the following your movements that's what

298
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,359
you do

299
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,619
shares

300
00:37:54,619 --> 00:38:05,819
somebody raises lots of rocky and
instantly closes eyes no it means just a

301
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:21,730
few drops into a Zeiss no more rocky
long answer such such as always always a

302
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:36,420
sign of of communication

303
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:44,010
it also could you also could bring
somebody out of the room like the US is

304
00:38:44,010 --> 00:39:06,440
like even looking friendly such
communication and iContact iContact

305
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:16,990
so if you have somebody who loses to eye
contact

306
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:23,450
forget about it even if he tells you the
truth the process either don't like you

307
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:29,560
or not honest with himself also
destroyed about himself but it's no good

308
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,210
if you have a conversation somebody
looks away I could be bad manners

309
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:40,280
because he had no childhood on the
family but it could be that he's afraid

310
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:47,150
that you see his lies it could be
anything as saying the fish eats

311
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:53,740
something else but maybe you should see
I got the dots therefore for killing

312
00:39:53,740 --> 00:40:02,470
time this year let's say I have a jacket
on and you stop me and say I need to

313
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:09,980
talk to you on your thoughts during this
like this yes it's very good to have

314
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:16,500
those other people I know it's also true
that people get you more hockey like

315
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,520
this yes so it's not comfortable he
definitely is not comfortable being

316
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,920
confronted and the moment let's say he's
talking to this girl I want to talk to

317
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,339
and I just look at him he starts that's
that's uncomfortable time what's even

318
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:39,109
worse is the worst sign when you're just
confronted somebody you don't want to us

319
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:47,598
when somebody does this you move out
according to be in countries like

320
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,280
Germany or I don't know how is insoluble
in countries like Germany is most likely

321
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:57,849
as my life that's on most unlikely as a
gun and concerts like the United States

322
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:01,930
its most likely has a gun i means money
goes to us this pocket I already have it

323
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:07,118
out because that's dangerous when they
when you can find something he starts

324
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,079
already playing with his jacket so
making space for instance to grab onto

325
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,099
his pants then this is not a good sign
for you when you stop somebody and

326
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:19,820
confronted with whatever playing with
your call whatever

327
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:27,610
this just have some rocky you can't have
enough that's not such a thing like to

328
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:42,570
pick up too much empty so hopefully its
scientific you guys can think off what

329
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:49,180
would make you nervous I mean we're not
talking about the body language when you

330
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:58,879
already pointing the gun at you make
your convinced it's over anything you

331
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,230
can think off its get about rocky

332
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:23,520
what would be something you would not
like our culture

333
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:30,040
like that right why wouldn't you like
that

334
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:38,480
personal space personal space and you do
not like to invite people into your

335
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:49,809
personal space right but

336
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:55,539
okay we're we are over this already so
we go to the next one boy with me

337
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,099
already had to all these

338
00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:07,539
go to next 10 there's one missing I
guess I mister slides cultural

339
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:12,299
differences cultural differences

340
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:18,709
keep in mind other people have other
cultures of a culture us to other things

341
00:43:18,709 --> 00:43:25,629
in Japan for instance they don't give
you their hands they do this makes total

342
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:30,219
sense if you look in the country
wherever humidity of almost 100% on the

343
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:36,099
heat from 44 40 degrees 35 degrees she
will not give two hands so its cultural

344
00:43:36,099 --> 00:43:44,609
differences right so you read like this
to hand could be already attack was

345
00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:57,519
about Arabia they aren't even worse when
they talk to each other D killed your

346
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:04,288
distance they talk really close to each
other and if you keep your distance in

347
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:10,869
this era still think you either don't
like or are you afraid of them or you

348
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:16,099
have something to hide it something
diets whatever but a lot of people

349
00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:24,759
didn't keep distance over there so when
you're let's say want to find out what's

350
00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:29,949
what's the other person's about you
should also take as a region incumbent

351
00:44:29,949 --> 00:44:36,529
you should try to understand where const
from and how people behave there because

352
00:44:36,529 --> 00:44:39,619
all your behavior the body language
everything you do

353
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:47,829
comes from your culture like my cultural
like this right so keep keep this in

354
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:54,059
mind thats people on other parts of the
world they act different funny occasions

355
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:58,549
when you have like a dollar and a marine
and you drop them into the desert and

356
00:44:58,549 --> 00:45:00,920
you smashing people because they come
close

357
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:07,780
rights so that's not what you want to do
so keep this in mind other cultures of a

358
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:15,170
behavior of the behavior kind of
different body language but is the body

359
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:23,020
language totally different what do you
think some things may be different but

360
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:35,610
the basics is the same you will see
that's a male a strong position as you

361
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:42,200
see a person in a strong position
raising his shoulders animal oh man it's

362
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,540
not a big difference if you have a prime
at the quite have the same facial

363
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,009
expressions and the quite have the same
bother bosnia's like a man like me I

364
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:57,000
like normal man like we are all when I
say man then i mean mankind's knots man

365
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,670
or female when I say that it doesn't
care I dozen kilometres own gender

366
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:10,530
gender so all these females stuff I
don't give a fuck at Sakura period so it

367
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:14,880
has no gender and hacker hacker is the
agenda just to make sure that you

368
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:21,660
understand we don't need prepackaged
because the agenda is hacker writes so

369
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:26,930
why not save mankind on man I mean
mankind and that means that we all

370
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:34,080
behave in certain things the same way
all smile all over the planet we all

371
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:44,220
make funny faces when we drink something
really sour we all got her gonna cry out

372
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:51,649
when he gets hurt so that many things
that the same in every culture only few

373
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:56,080
things are different in some cultures
and some cultures had two people trained

374
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:01,580
to not have any facial expressions for
instance in Japan told voy a class they

375
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:09,319
normally only short expression to gift
you like a gift is like you lost friends

376
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,010
and decried on purpose and front of you
so you see

377
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:18,920
how much doubt touched that's when you
look at and that's good way when when

378
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,650
you want to learn about facial
expressions or expressions by itself

379
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:29,480
look at autistic people data perfect
fall fall just some of the people who

380
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,960
are suffering artistic diseases they
have classes and you learn to

381
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,610
communicate these people communicate
more than you want to because they don't

382
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:46,930
know what is the right level and limit
right so they just happen tote you have

383
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:52,540
to say this and this and you're
perfectly can see and expressions what

384
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:58,140
they really feel there's somebody for
instance can't feel pain or can't feel

385
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:03,379
your pain like has no entity you can be
invoked as good as he wants you will see

386
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:08,290
it that you don't have a 30 because you
can't fake it at the moment you may be

387
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:13,340
faced with a minute later so when you
see somebody getting hurt as a normal

388
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,820
human being like this

389
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:24,030
your watching you two best fails of 2015
you see somebody a roller skate and get

390
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:29,480
smacked down between his balls and every
man would be but if you can't you're

391
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,760
paying you will copy it so first
somebody have to show it first so he can

392
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:41,180
copy it right so you're really easy can
spot somebody who cannot understand the

393
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:48,410
feeling the American Psycho part about
since I can't use this term since people

394
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:51,879
always think it's bad but whenever you
say something you should be without

395
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:57,770
judging the frustrating what you should
do is try to analyze things try to

396
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:03,590
analyze things and assigns way we are we
do not judge judging as for the other

397
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:09,090
people that's why Americans that can
judge all day long we have no good and

398
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:14,580
evil we have things we do not encourage
and we have things we do encourage we

399
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,610
have things we do understand we have
things we do not understand but we will

400
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:22,870
find them out what every time when you
do something try to find the source not

401
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,410
try to judge

402
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:35,879
and with that said I would say I'm done
with my talk any questions i premodern

403
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,600
common deception that and so let's say
if someone is trained to have like a

404
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:47,680
media training by the language and
someone else is like trying to realize

405
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,080
it's true or not obviously we can be
caught on camera as both like let's say

406
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:57,069
is there a way to like the C Leg to
people or people in the room yes

407
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:02,110
definitely is first of all you need to
be really good at what you do in like

408
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:10,530
you an investigator for whatever to
realize what you do you start framing

409
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:16,100
how I actually start modeling him to
start on questions about the

410
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,759
investigator I'm talking about the

411
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,920
the person that is actually being so all
your self

412
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,080
well it's like this people it's very
difficult if you want to a trick to

413
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:33,250
investigate and you really is knowing
what he's doing that is very difficult

414
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:40,310
because they are things you cannot do
let's say I show you an example ok you

415
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:46,529
blink love you I okay so what does this
reaction of you get an attack and you're

416
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:50,420
trying to avoid to attack it's even
better on a fly ball most of the time

417
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:54,660
you'll catch it or you just try to get
the same way expect especially when does

418
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:59,240
Paul is not expected and why do you do
thats why are you a possible widest

419
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,009
possible for your body in a split second
to help you I slowest

420
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:11,630
thought why is this so it's it's
reaction that we are like it's like

421
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:18,390
animal instinct limbic brain that's
actually actually your I saw a lot of

422
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:24,920
people slow urs muscle memory and that's
something you cannot you cannot trick

423
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:29,120
muscle memory if the guide investigate
they're really really really know what

424
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:34,440
what he's doing he will get you more
more more uncomfortable until you give

425
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:40,120
talents I don't have to have time I mean
depending on the country took the loss

426
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:44,580
in the country they can take like five
hours $1 10 hours 12 hours until you're

427
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:50,170
tired enough to give it up what are the
people like let's say you saw this body

428
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:55,300
language basics and we know that now so
for instance like obviously much more

429
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:00,170
trained them we are so he know those
basics like are there any way you can

430
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:07,320
treat us like you know I like you said
that moving around the room

431
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,930
means that you're not comfortable with a
space but like for instance some people

432
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:16,529
will watch that and try to see whether
you're telling alive while you're doing

433
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:27,020
something else haha ok I got this well
appointed you only can trick the people

434
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:31,600
they don't care so I when I'm moving
around here thats not tricking people

435
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,160
I'm not even try to talk to people
because three people just want to be

436
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:44,080
tricked what I'm doing here in a move
around 10 sure your participation I do

437
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:50,630
not think that I could trick you maybe I
could trick you if I psychological

438
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:56,970
enough and I feel like maybe after three
or four bottles I can trick you and make

439
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:04,410
you believe im drunk but I don't think
so it's like if you really if the body

440
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:11,839
is not doing what what the brain and
saying that its not working right so if

441
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:17,900
I don't I can't give you the answer to
your question so if I looked at him as a

442
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:23,560
really difficult if you ask me a
question I answer to you and it depends

443
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:31,490
on every person sure they are person the
country so level overcome a frame let's

444
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:36,500

frames per second

time of the Warring States and after
this time that a long time of peace and

454
