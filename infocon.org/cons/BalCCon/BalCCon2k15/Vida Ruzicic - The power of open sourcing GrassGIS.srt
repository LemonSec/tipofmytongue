1
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:29,890
welcome to this year's Belkin we are a
bit late but we already know

2
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:37,190
be double talk about the power of over
sourcing topic is greg is so please

3
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:49,379
welcome and enjoy that hello everyone
today I'll speak about grass guess power

4
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:56,620
of open sourcing and by Tony rather get
and what

5
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:05,720
but first I'll think about definition
above definition of grass gets glass

6
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:12,759
pieces graphic resource of my support
system commonly referred as grass keys

7
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:27,320
that open source open source system get
it published like General Public License

8
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:35,949
since 1999 then it's a portable

9
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:51,280
the weekend with the on Linux and other
devices but first British history grass

10
00:01:51,280 --> 00:02:03,790
is was born in the early eighties it was
developed it was a helicopter in america

11
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,320
army

12
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:17,600
that's developed this got a disgrace
system it was for use to show some

13
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:37,680
psychological logical system and they
tell us but now there is seven today we

14
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,910
have seven different types of grass
peace now the seventh nationally is

15
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:56,130
stable version and we can use it now
they it's frightening see language but

16
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:06,120
version 6 we grasp case came in Python
language it's easier to write and

17
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:19,010
understand for developers so that was
the best the bus now these days

18
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:26,850
stable version is grass is available
since 2015 it offers a large data

19
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,269
support improvement topological to the
order to achieve actor and driving

20
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:38,910
and much improved vector network allows
analyzed the best import the best thing

21
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:45,960
about certain grass guess seven version
is full-time parole framework and there

22
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:56,250
we can analyze different different the
images from from two or three types of

23
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:08,560
time and we can analyze these changes in
thinking been extended many many new

24
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:17,680
menu options have been added for example
for image processing go we can now we

25
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:33,170
can now analyze all bids will be on US
soil soil heat flux cause that in fact

26
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:42,070
are protesting there is faster dating
import we can make creating and new

27
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:51,190
basically indexes like button for design
vector analyzes there is there isn't so

28
00:04:51,190 --> 00:05:00,680
much memory required for general support
global mobile enabling and it improved

29
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,190
by John P

30
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,100
weekend

31
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:12,310
read-write grass refers to and from
numpy and we PSU supported that's mean

32
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:23,730
implemented in part sir like C C++
Python and she'll

33
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:42,780
question is who is using race as open
source program there is a lot of you not

34
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:50,239
just in commercial but the currently
grass species used in academic

35
00:05:50,240 --> 00:06:00,890
commercial purposes as well as many
governmental agencies including Norway

36
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:11,460
USD the CSI and the national parks parks
on this matter where you can see that

37
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:30,270
uses mostly used in Europe than in
America North America and little bit in

38
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:47,950
asia now talk about capability can do
with a roster to the factors that Dan

39
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:54,260
Hauk so support vector network analyzers
support image processing system

40
00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:01,840
we can realize system and grassed uses
linkable two different types of

41
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,890
databases like as well

42
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:14,830
PostgreSQL MySQL and SQL drunk driver
writer analyze that mean that we can

43
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:20,469
ultimata crossed the line in the area to
vector conversation than we can but

44
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,910
buffer instructors

45
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:36,390
profile they took over the weekend we
can put color table in these maps and

46
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:46,620
then we can director and point-to-point
data format

47
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:59,520
grass yes we can use different data
types like to the restaurant they take

48
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,190
including image processing trade of
oxidative for volumetric data to the or

49
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,360
3d vector data with apology and
multidimensional

50
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,330
point they roster geometry is presented
the in cell lot tricks with coordinate

51
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:27,370
the resolution is defined with south so
weird and high resolution can be in

52
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:34,450
kilometers meters degrees and but vector
geometry is presented like a point

53
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,289
Android line quandary

54
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:46,230
geometry is true to it really that means
we have XY and that coordinate to

55
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,959
present rector raita

56
00:08:48,959 --> 00:09:01,079
these are some command we can use in
grass keys for example every command

57
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:03,250
have some preferences

58
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:15,209
they can for which is specialized for
example graphics demeans is used for

59
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:23,888
function display that is the command for
graphical output than

60
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:30,579
fixes for raster function it's for
presenting rather data and the

61
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:37,758
protesting with then of course we for
red Torin protesting with director data

62
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:48,029
I will show you some examples with this
with the functions but important thing

63
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:57,760
to the Marshallese that grass always
import complete map but one we want to

64
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:10,579
export export we should to cut into area
of interest and with export factor we

65
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:24,599
always we always get the entire map with
raster we have two different functions

66
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:33,390
where we can define will we get mapping
orbit room as usual or

67
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:48,120
resolution current region resolution
these different functions are brought

68
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:58,460
out the F region is the current working
area and important thing is when we make

69
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:04,510
some cult calculations with directors
these calculations are made only format

70
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:12,390
but on roster calculation calculations
are made just on current reader that

71
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:19,840
means if we are a position on the serbia
these calculations will made just under

72
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:58,889
serbian not if map is about

73
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:26,169
dialog box and their way where is data
jews location and maps that are

74
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:34,329
important to choose because that the
final coordinate system than one week

75
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:55,750
rules all these last start

76
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:08,860
and this

77
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:22,720
windows where we we will display our
data and analyzed

78
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:41,449
which one will show for example it would
be a location and then ok this is one

79
00:13:41,449 --> 00:14:10,359
example we can make different type of
genetic maps

80
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:29,519
and on this matter will show railroads
this area for example we can make we can

81
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:40,209
make some analyzes like alright shaded
relief map it would be tearing analyzes

82
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:58,390
and here we can see the functions in
squares means that we we are using

83
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:09,220
raster and and now we can choose which
one of these functions will be used for

84
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:23,110
our next map for example will generate
contour lines here we should important

85
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:37,300
last name of the input would be rationed
name of output can't control the levels

86
00:15:37,300 --> 00:16:07,329
that important that we do we must define
these trees for example and right

87
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:18,589
now we can see all these contour lines
and that's great but here we have vital

88
00:16:18,589 --> 00:17:06,910
shell and what about if we need more
options

89
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:17,800
look at just for a moment I'll show you
a glass case Architektur and we can see

90
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:29,940
that as any open source program we can
make some code for this program and we

91
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:37,860
can make some improvements and on this
weekend see that python is very

92
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:51,810
important in developing with grass gas
detector pythons cup of tea it's in a

93
00:17:51,810 --> 00:18:06,429
way that started in with 2006 grass yes
grass started with scripting pipeline

94
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:13,420
because that's easier way to improve
grass gays and lesbians fighting is

95
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:19,680
default language for creating down there
are too many pipe and I worries included

96
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:28,690
in grass is but all of them are divided
into two in two parts for raster and

97
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:38,070
former rector on this two sides you can
find out many of the examples of these

98
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:47,030
scripts and on this picture is one
simple script for opening Quarian

99
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:55,290
closing of actor Matt it's true that the
grass is have over 400 different

100
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:02,490
functions who we can use but what if
there is there isn't our function that

101
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,500
we just need in that moment the best way

102
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:16,220
ways to write sample script this is
great but we cannot find out in bio

103
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:28,330
progress library the progress library
have a menu of Germany examples and get

104
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:35,909
horrible so we can find these python
script that can help us to solve our

105
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:47,750
problem and shoulders and although it is
implementing grass just $7 where we can

106
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:59,930
make our model and we can look on this
model in Python editor 404 advanced user

107
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:09,040
that that advantage because we can we
can make our model and by tonight or we

108
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:18,730
can make some some changes but for users
who are not as good in programming these

109
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,720
more those are the best way to make
their own

110
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,779
their own function

111
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:40,159
and make some improvements for in their
analyzes I can show you on grass gives

112
00:20:40,159 --> 00:21:07,379
side there is a programmer's manual with
these libraries we can find out some

113
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:23,178
codes that can help us to to solve our
problem and make improvements every new

114
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:42,809
every new Python script will which
really is uploaded on site is will be no

115
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:54,489
script will be uploaded and every month
we we get to these are the update on

116
00:21:54,489 --> 00:22:04,210
where we can use them if they are if
they are good we can use them and on

117
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:29,130
that way we improve everywhere journal
for grass case

118
00:22:29,130 --> 00:23:03,240
here we can make it by some some changes
and here is graphic modeler where we can

119
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:19,300
make some of those commander day and
here is also quite an editor if you if

120
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:28,830
you don't like to work with model you
can hold here directly and use your

121
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:50,530
script in analyzed and you can choose
which of this course we want to make

122
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:56,810
some command the way the model waitress
amanda roster command we choose one of

123
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:38,260
these want to make me with black door or
database we can use one of these ok

124
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:45,710
of course there is a lot of tutorials
for learning holding in Python the grass

125
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:55,860
juice scripting and for a final of Star
Trek there is one way deal from 1987

126
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:04,939
where Captain Kirk says speaks about
improvements encoding and he says don't

127
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:11,230
keep your information about soils
vegetation roads or archaeological sites

128
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:19,310
rolled up in my pubes or stuffed into
drama keep it in the computer so he he

129
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:26,270
said that we all need to work with maps
if you free work with it that's the best

130
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:33,840
way on computer and the best way to make
some improvements is to give our

131
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:45,020
contribution through making some scripts
and coding thank you and sorry for the

132
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,389
inconvenience
