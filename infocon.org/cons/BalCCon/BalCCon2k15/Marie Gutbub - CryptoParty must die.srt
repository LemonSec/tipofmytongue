1
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:35,920
so the next target is the party must die
by Marie thank you here is a provider of

2
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:43,860
security experts raise your hand if your
program our security expert great thanks

3
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,920
I'm not a programmer I'm not a security
expert to be honest I barely understand

4
00:00:49,920 --> 00:01:04,050
how these things work I'm thankful for
your work for the work you do

5
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:10,020
but I am going to talk not going to talk
about it today I'm a journalist and

6
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,949
activist I have mostly in being mostly
been working with people working

7
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,380
communication are in art for a really
long time I thought but your words

8
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,429
you're way off

9
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:30,490
acting your tolls were on mine I thought
that what you are doing is too

10
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:36,560
complicated for me it actually is what
you do it's a really complicated even if

11
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,510
it is not impossible to understand why
you guys decide being really good at

12
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:49,780
doing you're really important work a
really bad at something else you are bad

13
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:56,000
at communicating you are bad at sharing
the amazing tools to create with people

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,690
who don't identify as being experts in
what you do it's a shame you're so bad

15
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:08,550
if you should leave the hackerspace are
your place for a while and notice how

16
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:16,860
much is needed I was there and how hard
it is to use for normal people I am NOT

17
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:26,590
a programmer it doesn't mean that I'm
not a hackerspace nerd I know how easy

18
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,000
it is to stay there and I definitely
belong to these people who barely see

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,989
the sunlight because they prefer to
spend their time among other nerds with

20
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:41,890
some beloved club matter and a bunch of
laptops I know it's convenient I know

21
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:47,480
it's easier but it's wrong we need you
out there

22
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,940
R and I have been years if you would
leave the hackerspace and by this I

23
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,230
don't only need the hackerspace I mean
the nerd seen in general you will notice

24
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:04,290
something there are many people out
there who could help that many people

25
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,560
are there who want to help you guys
alright already doing great work at

26
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,230
spreading what you create their
activists communications specialist

27
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,649
journalists and artists who are willing
to work with you i think you should give

28
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,099
it a try

29
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:29,089
known as revelations helped raise
awareness about civilians what he did is

30
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:37,870
amazing but it's not enough it is our
job to take over now we need to work

31
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:43,359
together to bring encryption to as many
people as possible what you do is great

32
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:48,730
but it's not enough we need your tools
and we need people to bring them to the

33
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:55,608
general public so who here as a
journalist and artists are working

34
00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:08,940
communication in any way great has
already worked on privacy topics

35
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:18,980
I think that you should try have a
chance for some programmer afterwards we

36
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:34,590
should share your ideas with them lately

37
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,359
I have been thinking a lot about how to
communicate as a journalist I want to

38
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,400
help making everyone aware of what
surveillance means of how it works until

39
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,169
as a journalist I want to fight for the
rights to have a free press as a teacher

40
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:59,050
I tried to find IDs to explain tolls in
a way that everyone would understand and

41
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,880
as an activist I tried to change things
as a journalist teacher and activist I'm

42
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,700
also wondering why we aren't better
changing them I hope we agreed that were

43
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,240
in a position where more than ever we
need to help changing things and we need

44
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,860
to accept any help we can get even more
of this help is the kind of help that

45
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,940
will enable us to spread our knowledge
our tools in any possible way

46
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,360
crypto party is a decentralized global
initiative to introduce basic tools for

47
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,120
protecting privacy anonymity and overall
security on the Internet to the general

48
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,130
public the idea was conceived in the
wake of the Australian cyber criminal

49
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:49,560
legislation Amendment Bill 2011 National
Mall and the reasoning is that lost like

50
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,230
this are without substance when
everybody and Crips their communication

51
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:58,660
ripped apart here are needed crypto
parties are neither come out or

52
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:04,270
political alliance and free and open to
attend for everyone as long as they live

53
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:10,530
the guiding principles that two major
principles the first one is be excellent

54
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:15,700
to each other no harassment policy and
the second one is doing things if you

55
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:22,320
have a good idea just go for it

56
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:31,270
so basically to workshop which aunt or
an OTR the Trinity always secure browser

57
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:37,159
plugins on Firefox fine and fine and
hard disk encryption password security

58
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,650
managers with sometimes to install Linux
if people want it we teach stealth which

59
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:50,390
is a live system or even experimental
software like if people really wanna go

60
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,130
far

61
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:56,610
running a crypto party is amazing in a
few hours are able to empower people by

62
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,900
providing them tools that they never
thought they would be able to use some

63
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,750
help them to get back to privacy they
didn't have the they didn't think they

64
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,530
had the right to interpret the party's
fun it is meeting people learning

65
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,780
teaching each other in a relaxed and
respectful way organized trip to a party

66
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:22,330
and I love it but the party is not the
solution not everyone comes to a crypto

67
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,180
party not everyone can do so and not
everyone wants to do so and even if

68
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:36,380
everyone did we would need such we would
need so many times so much time so many

69
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,520
people to t-shirt so many resources that
would be impossible to teach everyone

70
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:49,109
from the party is a tiny bandage on a
giant warmed we are doing our best bet

71
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:55,490
for not naive crypto party will not save
us as a society from a surveillance the

72
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,130
program on a technical level and I know
there are other many many other levels

73
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,390
like political social level is that the
tools that provide good end-to-end

74
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,719
encryption are too complicated

75
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,650
whoever is an expert in computer
security will need to go through a

76
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,609
really long complicated process to
understand the tools I muster they use

77
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,220
and sorry again their rights to a basic
level of privacy

78
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:28,500
this is something we can't expect
everyone to do or even to be willing to

79
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,750
do I am NOT saying

80
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:37,909
everything is bad I have much respect
for everyone who provides as tools but

81
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,590
most of them are unfortunately not
accessible to everyone

82
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,110
a good example of how things should be
done is signal from open with four

83
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,660
systems they manage provided to a friend
cryptic messages and calls on

84
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:58,360
smartphones in this case iphone that I
easy-to-install understand I use this is

85
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:06,580
the way it should be conceived in the
future but in most cases this is what

86
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,980
beginners have to deal with I love OTR
but this website want help spreading it

87
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:18,590
if I don't know TR and I if I don't
really know a lot about computers this

88
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,110
will help me first

89
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:28,520
here we can see an attempt to explain
how it works it say that there are four

90
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,550
a really important point encryption
authentication denied the ability that

91
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,520
perfect forward secrecy I guess pretty
much from these expressions on the

92
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:44,250
website could understand the true first
points but then just forget about it

93
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:49,339
digital signatures that are checkable by
a third party is not something everyone

94
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,920
can understand same for private keys if
you have no idea what encryption you

95
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:01,229
won't understand that let someone just
recommended to me and I won't try to

96
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,600
understand it I'll just try to download
it from the website and/or Donald I can

97
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:14,460
see this year most people use pidgin
rADM when they want to use OTR there is

98
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:21,210
no mention of a dream for Mac on this
page and see any instructions on

99
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:26,660
downloading pigeon on Linux as well
there's only windows and if you're a

100
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,550
Windows or Linux users are once you're
done with the installation the troops

101
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,849
struggle continues you need to find out
by yourself that you should manually

102
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,940
activate the auteur plugin

103
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:42,220
a really long list of plugins only then
you'll be able to generate a key if you

104
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,430
understand what that means and start
once more manually

105
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:53,670
ninety our conversation by clicking on
the words not try vote then you might be

106
00:10:53,670 --> 00:11:00,459
safe except that pigeon keeps logs by
default which means that your end-to-end

107
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,620
encrypted conversations with perfect
forward secrecy will stupidly be

108
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,030
recorded on your device

109
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:13,819
this is everything but privacy by design
to go back to the starting point

110
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,350
OTR web side not so long ago I had a
nice surprise and your website authority

111
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:26,150
are so I thought yeah good job this
looks much more modern so there is

112
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:31,600
actually some basic information on this
website if you scroll down

113
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,110
also there is this link the first one
here it says get to know the Altera

114
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,270
protocol and when you click on it

115
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:51,260
you come back they're back to the old
city paid user pain level very high and

116
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:57,470
I don't even talk about pgp when I'm
talking about this so

117
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:02,420
these these might be details to you
every single problem I'm unmentioned is

118
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:08,380
more than a detail if you're new to
these things and it can be change know

119
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,600
the tools to I used to criticize a lot
for this kind of things the store I

120
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,640
tried to install tour for the first time
in 2010 because I read something about

121
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,710
it on the internet I was really curious
you tell I didn't understand anything

122
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,320
there was no documentation and I gave up
and decided that peace will definitely

123
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,360
need to complete that catered for me the
next time I came back to encryption was

124
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:41,360
2013 officers known that he had a good
surprise star improve its communication

125
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,650
so this has been released a few months
ago if they made a few of these flights

126
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:52,780
these lines are also they are great
tools for teaching tar and they're also

127
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:58,390
great because they show something really
important about are they show torah

128
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:04,730
understood that they can be better at
communicating at a critical part we try

129
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:10,500
to come up with solutions to explain
tools we make videos tutorials we invent

130
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,890
stories and build our own to your door
your treat yourself to try to make him

131
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:21,760
friction as accessible as possible on
the to show you this example this has

132
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,080
been made by a guy who joined crypto
partly I'll say six weeks ago he didn't

133
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,080
know how to encrypt how to encrypt
anything he has a MacBook he had done

134
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:37,010
nothing with computers I think two days
ago you sent me this picture as he said

135
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,280
I learned how to encrypt email and child
and/or entities tour and I wanted to

136
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,500
give something back to her to a party
and he made these pgp boxes so they're

137
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,620
basically explain the concept of public
here privately year here there is some

138
00:13:51,620 --> 00:14:00,610
encrypted text fingerprint and I D short
I D but there is this key to open the

139
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,769
box found a way to explain in his

140
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:10,160
own really simple way what he had
learned in the last weeks but this has

141
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,679
been a solution we have to come up with

142
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:20,439
because we have no choice as long as
there will be needed we will keep doing

143
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:21,368
what we do

144
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:25,999
teaching encryption to everyone wants to
learn it because everyone has the right

145
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:31,959
to privacy privacy has a basic human
right but even if we love what we do

146
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:36,149
we're still hoping that soon we won't be
needed anymore

147
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:45,670
ripped apart he must die and we need you
to help us to be a trip to a party we

148
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,628
ask you programmers to work with us to
work with people who are on the ground

149
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:55,869
who are to work with people are teaching
and explaining your tools to work with

150
00:14:55,869 --> 00:15:00,949
you X people to work with communication
people to work with whether we could

151
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:05,579
help to share the tools to make don't
worry about us will find something else

152
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:12,559
to do I was really not so far yet would
like to invite you at a party tomorrow

153
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:18,569
if you want and if you want to organize
your own cryptic party if you have

154
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:23,420
questions about how to teach encryption
will have a session on Sunday as well to

155
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,299
end this talk of like to share something
with you it is the video we made to

156
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:34,009
introduce crypto party one of the
several tools we build to help to share

157
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:38,929
some concepts behind the idea of
surveillance and the fact lots of people

158
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:43,510
still think they have nothing to hide

159
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:49,400
see this moment we have to use
technology to open up our democracy let

160
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:55,050
me ask a simple question does it concern
you that the government is not doing

161
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,280
anything wrong and that nothing to hide
and they're not share it with your

162
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:12,400
Facebook password which a bank account
number and say last night on Google I

163
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:31,449
don't like this interview I don't think
there's so much she is also the case

164
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,420
that they want to have a world where
everyone has privacy and dusty

165
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:40,579
confidentiality and integrity in their
daily life without having to ask for too

166
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,890
big it from a master because it is the
case that when you ask someone for those

167
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:55,030
things they may not grant them and then
you free

168
00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:07,430
conspiracy routinely intercept American
citizens emails know the intercept

169
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:17,410
Americans cell phone conversations no
Google searches no text messages no I'm

170
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:30,210
was signed orders no bank records no
general clapper hundreds of millions of

171
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:46,000
Americans no sir it does not not
wittingly

172
00:17:46,000 --> 00:18:13,060
intelligence community in general is
focused on getting intelligence wherever

173
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,500
by any means possible that he believes
on the grounds of sorts

174
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:26,429
self-certification that they serve a
mission which was

175
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:37,869
the communications about it in just some
point it collects them in that system

176
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:39,259
that filters

177
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:44,470
measures in its stores though for
periods of time simply because that's

178
00:18:44,470 --> 00:19:01,370
the easiest most efficient and most
valuable way to cheat

179
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:35,459
documented as a contender in that
Infiniti IPL and then they can use this

180
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:47,370
system every decision every and attacks
on that basis to sort of the rides

181
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,110
suspicion from an innocent life

182
00:19:50,110 --> 00:20:06,879
anyone in the context of wrongdoing

183
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:30,600
they don't call it a little bit but what
the NSA is doing not just domestically

184
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:39,370
but globally is created the USA
government two years he was responsible

185
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:50,489
for espionage QSR citizens he left the
service fee to change the rules of

186
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:55,720
engagement

187
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:06,770
nothing in the network that uses so
consumed about their day I did find out

188
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:15,110
what they're doing with my dad so I make
sure I read in their whatever whatever I

189
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,678
the same time I see them so that when
they collected they know what I'm

190
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:25,370
thinking of you should not do you have
something

191
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:31,770
the government controls us to what can
people do first they can declare

192
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:36,010
themselves to be free and secondly they
can declare it by using strong

193
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,590
encryption when they use telephones by
talking to journalists about the things

194
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:46,500
that these steps to defund organizations
that fundamentally violate the group

195
00:21:46,500 --> 00:22:08,310
says that reinterpret the g10 privacy
laws that are criminals quick

196
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:22,139
what you have internet just the most
effective before you i think i

197
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:28,690
understand who controls the internet
controls the dog and who controls

198
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:37,389
controls

199
00:22:37,389 --> 00:24:01,468
we should be able to accomplish this
with cryptography encryption we should

200
00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:06,440
have an epidemic of surveillance and
then we need to practice harm reduction

201
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,140
strategies with cultural norms

202
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,590
you want to connect to me
