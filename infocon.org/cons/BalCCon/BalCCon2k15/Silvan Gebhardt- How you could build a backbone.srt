1
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:31,848
will be giving a talk about the backbone
so presentation is about to start so

2
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:34,559
good afternoon

3
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,970
couple of people know me here not
everyone's so in the presentation going

4
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:47,570
to talk a little bit Who I am what we do
what I do personally what we do as a

5
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,619
company what I have been doing in the
past this talk is about the backbone

6
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:59,659
it's about our network infrastructure
what I'm going to do in the future and

7
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:03,729
also what is nice to have that
functionality and 12 building what I

8
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:10,280
want to extend so first of all a
question around just raise your hands

9
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:18,820
who has noticed that we use public IP
addresses on this conference six people

10
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:27,179
who has actually try to figure out more
about those ip addresses for five people

11
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:37,780
great so when my eye on an internet
service provider in Switzerland and

12
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,270
obviously as you can see I can extended
to serbia that's not a problem we're

13
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,119
going to even to extend it to the
Telenor datacenter in belgrade in his

14
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:57,590
future at the moment I operate the AAS
number 58 1998 snom vs basically you're

15
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,880
identifier in the internets the internet
dismal to serious of two it's a mesh

16
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,299
network everyone connected if everyone
but you should be unique so in order to

17
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:11,039
be unique

18
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:18,819
you get your alias number so this is my
identifier dis is my sign our network

19
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:24,589
we started in 2012 we call type
addresses from ripe last year we

20
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,629
actually started it took me two years to
actually get older relatives together to

21
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:34,349
get the money together in order to buy
internet lines in order to buy

22
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:42,388
connectivity from my ass piece if anyone
wants to connect us for social metrics

23
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:48,239
I'm going to send you the link later on
you can also find me on this see free

24
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:57,049
help desk so if anyone here has enormous
Ecco and it's the same account anyway so

25
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:03,169
back to what we do so we operate this
backbone in Switzerland

26
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:09,750
easier bank bonus to 1st thing well you
order your own lines you don't play your

27
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,439
own Firebird it's too expensive you
normally work with carriers you normally

28
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:21,709
order lines so for example in order to
get from Basel in Switzerland Zurich and

29
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:27,639
sports science well after talks somebody
else they keep you to network ports and

30
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:35,699
its allies on their network I used his
backbone for a winds around the backbone

31
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:41,310
on this year and around the backbone on
their scone couple of weeks ago how

32
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,049
would you do that well I don't have a
fire line to Switzerland all we have is

33
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:52,919
3 p.m. connections so wherever there is
a need for a conference we normally

34
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,819
connect to that and we have our own
internet nobody does any filtering

35
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:07,078
completely open so what do I need to
backbone for we do colocation like it's

36
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,229
not like other people do we went out to
maintain its Web Hosting well the usual

37
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:22,090
shit you know nothing spectacular also
consulting nothing spectacular so

38
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:29,690
what have I done in the past so in order
to get your own network up and running

39
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:35,630
well somewhere you have to connect and
somebody else I had to create BGP

40
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:45,560
sessions who here has been on one of my
BGP workshops three people so you know

41
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:52,160
about BGP that's great I actually had to
do the workshop in order to teach myself

42
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,729
how to do that because nobody teaches
you how to do BGP there's books about

43
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:05,229
the books are our five centimeters thick
like ok I have to learn this before I

44
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:12,080
can actually use it I cannot remember a
whole book cold fury you tolerable if

45
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,419
you want to play around and if you want
to learn about it just as I said before

46
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:23,440
tried to conduct DNA 42 it's definitely
worth to learn about it what I did I

47
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,130
learned my own I did my own set up by
learning in this private VPN test

48
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:36,090
network so I learned how to connect we
need seven for those people who don't

49
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,760
know you need seminary currently
launching a business and private

50
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,440
customers well now they got a lot of
fiber connections in Switzerland they're

51
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,810
selling bandwidth to people like hats to
large enterprises and it's actually nice

52
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,970
I mean if you get a network connection
here from CES BB happy ever walked into

53
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,490
the office and talked to do

54
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,690
network engineer who should solve your
problem and you had to call off hurts

55
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:15,150
your problem is solved not really well
if you want to do business on a smaller

56
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:20,500
scale you need to find a nice be like
that that's one idea I can walk to those

57
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,120
guys and he is I need something special
you know how you can get them to do

58
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,110
something special you bring them a whole
box of Cooma and they do it for you

59
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:37,250
or they say okay forget about the setup
so I got this backbone I got it

60
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:44,300
connected to I have a collocation in
surgery but by the way about 100

61
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,990
kilometers away and now I extended it to
gloat failed and that's close to the

62
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:58,720
German border so very difficult to see
but here's a picture so if you want to

63
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,320
get into a backbone down it's hard to be
rather difficult first of all you have

64
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,840
to connect two different data centers so
I have the collocation incirlik I put

65
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,609
server seeing I got from one of my
client actually a ring that connects to

66
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:23,010
Basel Basel is one datacenter to fibers
today can use from my own to another day

67
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:31,450
to center and I have to connect back to
circus you can see Equinix 13 so in

68
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,289
order to connect from sarah took a lot
of felt and I have to go through Basel

69
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:44,870
makes sense not really that's 200
kilometres for nothing but it saves

70
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,400
money I have to pay only on that we are
less service and on the airplane so far

71
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:57,750
so cheap you see any redundancy on this
nobody sees any redundancies on it

72
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:05,970
that's the problem except well the ring
is protected but still if it doesn't

73
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:11,850
help so what should you do in order to
make it more autonomy Welle French

74
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:20,280
things first of all internet exchanges
internet exchanges is something nice if

75
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:28,159
you want to avoid that the NSA is
watching all of your communication make

76
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,400
sure to get an Internet service
providers who keeps they tell local in

77
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:40,340
serbia their socks so if you're say
Telenor and you're chatting with

78
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,649
somebody on the SPB and both Telenor

79
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:50,019
and as bibi is on socks never leave
serbia your packets go to belgrade and

80
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:58,050
back that's it very simple and best of
all things those service providers are

81
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:06,069
most of the time 3d GPU fastest internet
exchanges you pay for a port and you POV

82
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:13,559
fullest and well shorter alt is keeping
tato Loko it also has a second it won't

83
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,519
ditch if you don't have to go for
Frankfurt for example your latency is

84
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,220
better

85
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:27,480
better-paying times you can kill the
other party much faster so I decided I

86
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,720
will go to psychics this is scheduled so
I can keep the data locally in

87
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,829
Switzerland if anybody wants to see more
how the situation is in serbia there's a

88
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:46,459
talk that has been done by a ripe
members about the Internet in serbia so

89
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:55,758
next coach and so coach and is a
so-called tier one ISP so highest piece

90
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,499
everyone is diminish and you have to
connect to other people but how does

91
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,540
that work

92
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:09,790
who pays whom so that Iran is an ISP who
doesn't have to pay anyone else for

93
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:15,748
Creek connectivity they only have to pay
for probably investments on their fibers

94
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:21,649
to have to pay for power on their road
trip but take a shit load of money from

95
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:27,170
all their clients connecting to tempt
why they've been early on the game and

96
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:33,339
they have a lot of connections to other
people so i decided i connect with

97
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:40,649
cogent it's a so-called tier one they
have about 5,000 more direct connections

98
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:49,259
I'm one of five thousand if you remember
bank I have to number fifty page 299 its

99
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:55,310
16 gigs 16 REITs means 65,000 individual

100
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:01,550
stand-alone networks in the world live
below number we're running out of 16 bit

101
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:07,459
AES numbers but still has about 50,000
individual networks on the network so if

102
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,580
I can connect for one ISP directly to
10% of the internet which is so large

103
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:20,740
part it keeps 04 drought means lower
latency hey you're fostering killing

104
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:29,190
your body again same thing next thing TV
factory did Brenda my USB you don't know

105
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:38,940
if that's clear if you have large
telecom providers Deutsche Telekom don't

106
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:44,150
normally pretty asked hits in the
internet I and everyone connects fair

107
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:49,230
and equally owned those internet
exchanges because it saves money on both

108
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:56,990
sites if you're like the large ISP in a
country like especially in Germany

109
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,400
Deutsche Welle are you interested

110
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:08,040
the outer body saves money no because
you think well my clients are the

111
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,709
majority of clients for IOUs piece here
so if the other people have competent

112
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:24,440
they have to pay me besides pay I get
double the money while in Switzerland I

113
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:30,089
have the same problem with Swisscom with
cablecom so I had to pay another ISP

114
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:35,510
like me who's a bit larger who pays
actually those ISPs to connect close by

115
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:41,530
well if I have clients to do Suisse com
or cable comb or just a large cable

116
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:50,150
providers I need short routes so that's
the next thing I need more uplinks so if

117
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:55,589
you remember I have a new terminals are
playing gets Suisse I X I get coach and

118
00:12:55,589 --> 00:13:01,529
I get TV factory in that's a lot more
redundancy them before what could we do

119
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:03,339
more

120
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:07,870
well one back bonus minds but what if

121
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:16,520
mistake but about to backbones well I
managed to get a new number which is by

122
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,010
the way very simple to remember

123
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:25,000
Switzerland 666 the number of the beast
I don't know how I will call my backup

124
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,140
backbone it's the second backbone but I
think I'll do something funny with it

125
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:35,810
next thing that so the next thing you're
going to do is fine now you have a

126
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:41,469
backbone but what i said i mean it's
found a chinese couple of routers to

127
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:48,200
generate noise to move around packets
but to use power power costs so you need

128
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,930
clients right they should somebody
should pay your debt because otherwise

129
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:58,930
it doesn't work so I actually now I do
connect downlink so we have fiber to the

130
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:04,130
home ISPs Internet slanted actually buy
connectivity from me that's coming soon

131
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:10,180
now if you have to backbones on the same
lines you end up with a big mess in the

132
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:17,680
routing tables for people that have been
playing with routers andre-pierre and

133
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,279
it's the same so basically start to
personalize your backbone you online and

134
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:28,000
you split your personalized it that way
at a resource usage it's like you have

135
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,140
the server where you were flies to
machines don't influence each other so

136
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:37,449
this is coming soon this is actually
coming soon like this month all of that

137
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:46,060
sounds like a stressful month that's how
it's going to look like you see that

138
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:54,310
somehow we actually end up something
purely resembled syringa right ring is

139
00:14:54,310 --> 00:15:00,469
nice because if one line fails we can
use another line interaction to the new

140
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,640
site I cannot put forward redundancy
chariot the one on the top right corner

141
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:12,230
that our like low-cost colocation I
cannot afford the second line to tighter

142
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:18,880
so we have to ring have you ever played
by accident

143
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,730
a cable twice in your suite wrist on
that plugging in a cable tie senior

144
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:29,470
suits come on everyone seriously
everyone has done that what happens

145
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:36,610
best we just blinking like crazy well
what actually does happen is you have a

146
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:44,290
lot of management communication hey who
has disciple the ARP protocol if you

147
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:51,030
have an opinion as well that packet cats
and wrong and round and round and round

148
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:58,329
then he keeps on going and the crisis
your backbone there's a solution for

149
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:07,690
that supposedly well it's called
spanning tree that's right so in order

150
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:14,640
to avoid to do well we could just like
got one of those lines or just block one

151
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:24,050
line we don't have anymore and if it
goes over we just switch nice and

152
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:35,260
concept really bad because you need to
every single switch to participate in

153
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,540
spanning tree you have a priority
because you want to do have the strong

154
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:48,150
this rich to be the root it's like a
tree spanning tree onto solid trying not

155
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:52,449
a brother little brains and then you
have suddenly a trio need that will fall

156
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,140
over

157
00:16:54,140 --> 00:17:01,819
well that thing that normally wear to
pick up to happen because if you have on

158
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,200
the top right corner I small internet
line over there and you do have mistaken

159
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,830
spanning tree and you decide to reboot
one off your route resigned suddenly

160
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:18,060
altruistic and some there and you're
like I'm all my packets go so slow

161
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:24,240
well you end up starting to dislike
spending

162
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,590
ninety percent of my network failures
have definitely been spanning tree so

163
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:35,220
that's one thing to consider spending
trees dangerous perhaps there's a better

164
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:43,090
solution for let's see so that's how
it's going to look this month what do we

165
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:48,770
want to do in long-term well we just
heard that spending three can be

166
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,280
difficult there's a second problem

167
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,830
spanning tree blocks lines right side
half a line I'm going to pay for but I'm

168
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:03,419
not going to actually use it that's a
waste of money I don't like that

169
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:09,780
well what you can do is instead of using
VLANs in York or you can use different

170
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:16,379
protocols instead of Internet MPLS MPLS
is basically something between also they

171
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:23,340
are to free its label switching so at
the moment we're having this closed

172
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:30,379
virtualized routing tables let's play
that out and go to MPLS MPLS in the

173
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:37,570
quarter and you'd actually takes a
shortest path instead of the only path

174
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:46,300
better capacity better latency older
resources are used with want a spanning

175
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:53,980
tree blocking me so far on MPLS layer
freak or as you normally hear just two

176
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,559
stretches I don't you see you want your
core and later to earlier free I'm going

177
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:04,139
on a freak or so next thing which is
very important PCP 3884 I'm going to

178
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,590
have another talk on that as soon as
I've actually implemented that I'm still

179
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:14,760
learning that so here on the congress
network we have 11 to 16 14 / 20 free

180
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:21,830
that's IP addresses we got four days
congress network things which should not

181
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:28,309
happened because then there's something
wrong if my firewall here to quarrel to

182
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:31,500
seize territory subjected coming in

183
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,100
source IP from the congress network but
it actually coming in from the outside

184
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:44,959
that's definitely something wrong and
also if my router sees it leaving my

185
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:52,830
network but that's not my IP addresses
should be dropped and this is best

186
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:59,549
practices guide and dis shoot be
implemented why there's a problem with

187
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:06,200
OpenDNS servers if somebody send a
spoofed packet to a DNS server with her

188
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:13,210
spoofed source IP address the DNS server
because he to UDP will reply to it but

189
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:19,159
because justice source IP smooth it
replies to a victim and not were

190
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:25,720
depicted came from and normally answer
is much bigger than the question that

191
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:32,720
the so-called amplification attack
happens with DNS happens with NTP the

192
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,200
big problem especially on those
management port if all the ISPs in the

193
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,720
engine it would actually implement that
there would be no amplification attack

194
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,659
anymore and we're talking about hundreds
of gigabytes of amplification traffic it

195
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:56,029
nearly took down CD ends in the last
year so everyone has to implement that

196
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:58,480
and I should do it as well

197
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,570
next thing we have to score on MPLS well
we still have to promise if I'm going

198
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,549
from A to B and you end up having a loop
by accident because you connect to

199
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:11,860
switching their forgot the switches are
connected on somewhere else Trulia

200
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:18,139
backbone well let's do it differently
and use some form of people and Italy

201
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:25,379
are true tunnel so what I'm buying from
other people I can create on my own and

202
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,679
sell it and so if I have a new phone
connection from A to B take some form of

203
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:31,299
bpm

204
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:41,549
that's one thing so next thing you don't
tax well very bad and you don't attack

205
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:50,940
coming in now imagine you have a 10
Gigabit line from your ISP attacking and

206
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:56,350
you get an attack of 20 G to EUR server
some serving your network at attacked

207
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:02,399
well even if you say ok I just dropped
this traffic on my router is that going

208
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:11,570
to help 10 G line 28 traffic you're out
the only solution instead I actually

209
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:19,918
asked my ISP who connects me to the
other people to feel that a trashy at 2

210
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,649
a.m. in the morning will they be happy
if i wake them up

211
00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:31,369
not really bitchy people are calling I
sent him a specific route I give it not

212
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:35,289
counting the number of the beast I take
it with 666 everyone does it with their

213
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:40,690
tits bad packets you take it with the
number of the beast and they know that

214
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:45,139
black gold IP so we drop traffic to
suddenly I don't have a problem anymore

215
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:51,549
and it doesn't cost me because twenty
geek on my line that's going to be

216
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:58,239
expensive Childress out doesn't cost me
a nice thing next thing is we're also

217
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:02,519
going to do they are free repin that's
the long-term solution that's especially

218
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,060
for customers that want to have

219
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:13,560
nice but they don't care about
encryption why is this relevant

220
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:21,040
well this is how it should look in the
future we have those free retro tourists

221
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:29,210
are going to be MPLS routers I don't
really want visible in Internet they're

222
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:34,770
not relevant to customer service so
let's hide em so the idea is we have

223
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:39,960
those blue route risk they are at the
actual address to connect to the

224
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,930
internet and everything in between

225
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:51,350
let's use a VPN that way even if we have
an attack on on my backbone the core is

226
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:57,320
not affected the course not to be seen
if the chorus not routed in the internet

227
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,379
nobody can access it

228
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:08,360
story safety all lots of firewall rules
because it's not visible so this year

229
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,790
will be a ring

230
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:17,460
we have things happening to the ride so
still we have a lot of redundancy but

231
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,870
we're not going to have spanning tree
across the network

232
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:30,500
one big role and we're not going to
health and they are two core we're going

233
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,360
to use VPLS we're going to use our cut
our road trips for that I got them for

234
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:44,908
free nights and this whole thing will be
changing things I learned

235
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:50,960
during a set up a backbone I recommend
not to do that if you ever do a big

236
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,299
network and that can also be a campus
has a good feel in stretchy from and not

237
00:24:56,299 --> 00:25:00,249
just like home what's real and could I
use that we learned his three

238
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:04,849
well its use it I created a big mess I
still have a big mess have to clean that

239
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:10,330
up straight to your leon is going to
help you otherwise it's really messed up

240
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,099
next

241
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:19,849
ipv6 so I before you have hardly any
addresses so you use them as resourceful

242
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:25,989
as you can you split it up to speed up
you speed up more v-6 we have enough IP

243
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:33,769
addresses at least for now but it's much
bigger if you have a subnet from right

244
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:38,970
or any other local registry you're
supposed to actually say ok we have

245
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:44,049
those pits cannot change the first
couple of bits that's your prefix the

246
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:50,499
party cannot changed its called a prefix
after that I have potentially couple of

247
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:58,369
bits in my case ninety six bits for free
I can use whatever whatever I want to do

248
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:04,178
64 bit this an irregular network that
leaves me 32 bits left to play around

249
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:12,210
this and I just started ok network
network to network free thing that

250
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:19,349
that's a big mistake you should split it
up like a freebie it is the country free

251
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:24,080
bit sister city you actually should
split a lot like that and I completely

252
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,189
missed that up

253
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,229
great if you have to remember your whole
backbone and you have to tell every

254
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:33,919
single customer did he has to change its
DNS records because he's going to get

255
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:40,710
new IP addresses I tell you that

256
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:48,940
another big mistake it so you have all
those devices where you have to access

257
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:57,020
and management network switches to
become triggers well normally use

258
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,120
private IP addresses in order to split
it between pictures it should not be

259
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:08,250
accessible from the public Internet nice
thing concept bad if you actually leak

260
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:14,429
those address the spikes attending to
your own routing table because ok the

261
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:19,669
Internet cannot access your management I
please but every single one of your

262
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:28,710
customers can that's got some
interesting effects on task is to use a

263
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:34,840
different route think table again so it
does not makes so like a server with

264
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:41,908
first machines we have fun 112
management netter and take cannot jump

265
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:44,590
to each other and again

266
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:50,590
avoid spanning tree if you can search
for other functionality at least don't

267
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:57,520
do spanning tree in a church no
spanning-tree decor nobody's going to

268
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,490
pageant air anyway

269
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:06,390
tried to only have spanning tree on the
switches were clients access it don't do

270
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:12,190
spanning tree on the uplink ports it has
my side effects yes it's a good concept

271
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:22,860
but it messed up more than what I
normally if somebody does the

272
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:28,139
presentation is what actually equipment
people use and I'm always seemed

273
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,720
president of my own so for people who
are interested in using Alcatel Corp

274
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,580
alturas

275
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:41,029
to about 200 gigabytes on their
management board you have 10 Gigabit

276
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:46,370
slot and the big one service Roger 7 you
actually can put in hundreds of its

277
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,979
parts so I think hundred be a bit too
still

278
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,799
that's going to last a couple of years
hopefully we'll never know

279
00:28:53,799 --> 00:29:02,330
core routers well my chorus which they
fell off a trunk as well

280
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:07,030
somehow I got a lot of equipment so I
got switches to can do 720 carpet

281
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,129
switching routing for free

282
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:13,690
very nice if you have if you know
actually manufacture who switch out

283
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:20,169
equipment because they're upscaling
sometimes it's worth to ask on the trade

284
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:24,760
teen your suppliers you know that your
supplier dust readings if they're

285
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:30,040
sexually stuff that gets traded in if
you can buy that sometimes to give it to

286
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,659
you for free on the sweetest blockade
these are very very small its richest

287
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:42,480
6440 data for you can get it for 48
ports deposit $1500 never let me down

288
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,870
their work as rock-solid 6450 it's about
$3,000 they have 10 gel things those are

289
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:54,809
like two or courses in my network I used
them for clients that need two hundred

290
00:29:54,809 --> 00:30:01,678
percent reliability and they want to
spend some money for my rotors to

291
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,750
connect to you to tell playing I think
you guys have a lot of me critic here in

292
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:14,049
serbia very strong why they're really
cheap at the moment I used to 36 chorus

293
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:22,059
models just imagine a CPU is 36 course
very nice and I'm going to descend into

294
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:28,879
two core model soon that has a times 10
GbE ports well I am mentioned that I'm

295
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,940
going to upgrade to 10 G this I realized
the couple of free trigger home

296
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:41,700
I'm going to buy 10 G but I don't have a
role to ascertain jacquard BGP router

297
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:48,110
justice richest and decor out this time
not yet routers at routers are outside

298
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:53,809
of your tractor connecting you to do so
I have to trunk lines to get hurt that's

299
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:58,870
not accurate solution if you have to
bond lines not for a production

300
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:05,820
environment also stuff to do we use
extreme switchers we use it here as well

301
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:12,168
we have a few steps further workshop I
got them for free from other ISPs very

302
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:16,639
nice if an ISP actually gives up
business and goes bankrupt you can catch

303
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:23,120
up quite a bit of equipment Alcatel the
same Cisco switches and for for

304
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,889
management network actually unmanaged
Netgear switches are really really nice

305
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:34,209
so why do I do this work why do I get a
second backbone what would be nice

306
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:40,950
well you know the government normally
ask science piece about their customers

307
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:47,129
if they think they have an investigation
going on then some I operate a large

308
00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:57,529
WiFi network in Switzerland well I have
a couple off lawful intercept requests

309
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:02,570
but it's pouring out at like one or two
a month I mean that's not like the

310
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:09,189
record in Switzerland I would like to
break this records so bring it on I get

311
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,559
this second backbone cause I don't want
to risk the primary production for some

312
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:19,379
nice stuff what about torex it notes the
government just asking me for torex it

313
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:23,668
now it every week I don't carry sticking
a fork until well that was

314
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:28,220
disassociation you have to go there any
associations as well

315
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:35,279
ok we're boned we give up and we create
a new association you can play around a

316
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,220
little bit with it I think that would
work pretty nicely because most of the

317
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,360
time it's actually a liability

318
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:48,070
so create associations I keep using
Internet connectivity tutoriales that's

319
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:54,270
just traffic research note on Monday 12
scandia internet fine for me

320
00:32:54,270 --> 00:33:02,379
trip to service its mind at the moment
is still pretty nice in terms of law we

321
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,570
might change it we might lose out that
you don't have to spy on their customers

322
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:12,550
but we actually fighting it pretty hard
for iPhone a lot of people probably

323
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:16,560
heard about them they want to create
free wi-fi networks nobody wants to be

324
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:22,990
liable for a trade association create
the thousand associations I don't care

325
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:28,380
if I have to deal with the government
why let's make a living out of it

326
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:34,830
the government pays you 250 bucks for
every question to ask you bring you dawn

327
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:38,649
I could leave home that I don't care

328
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:46,060
enemy of the state also we took quite a
bit of sponsoring four different

329
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:53,250
organizations like the freedom
initiative for

330
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:58,090
for information exchange yeah we have
quite a few associations in our backbone

331
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:02,350
already so

332
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:10,449
anyone wants to contact me here's a
couple off contact information I think

333
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:17,989
sent me encrypted email if you can it
would be perfect I have a Twitter

334
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:28,158
account that's my private 1 I've an
email address here so from my point of

335
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,590
view for questions I'm up for feedback
if anyone has some feedback on the

336
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:40,960
backbone or ideas or questions on
decisions wait for the microphone how

337
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,810
much less and number number of costs to
me this

338
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:55,290
ok so first of all together a US number
you either need to find a friend who is

339
00:34:55,290 --> 00:35:02,310
a so called local internet registry
local when it reaches our members of Fri

340
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:06,000
because we're here in Europe so for us
to the right

341
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,480
membership for Ibis $40,000 in the first
year $1,600 upcoming years or Euros

342
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:20,270
think it's actually you're sorry you're
bumped the actual check to have an AAS

343
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:26,970
number from Ryan fifty euro for das
number but any number is boring it

344
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:31,779
doesn't help you you also need some IP
addresses you can ask for an ipv6 subnet

345
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:36,580
without being a member that's a hundred
euros a year

346
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:42,779
standard contract and you can actually
put curing the internet exchange points

347
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:50,790
like socks when you bite into two socks
you want to bring to the local providers

348
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:55,990
but you don't have done nothing to lose
real internet know that only to the

349
00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:00,009
people to participate yes that's the
idea of an Internet exchange you always

350
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:05,260
need up links as well and internet
exchange is meant as in neutral platform

351
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:12,610
and a explosive the time explicitly
forbid to do trains it it's coltrane's

352
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,180
it if you go outside

353
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:20,129
normally made it so we need a plan
providers but you don't want to pay your

354
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,840
uplink provider if you see all the
traffic is locally you want to save

355
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:33,110
money I need you always need to now
playing

356
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:37,700
yeah if you want to go to Facebook
actually depends Facebook actually

357
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,180
Pearson some places but still you want
the whole internet you need at least one

358
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:48,089
are playing that can be a local
authorized be but it should be it must

359
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,800
be a private connection

360
00:36:51,800 --> 00:37:18,570
house which has two connected internet
exchange there is another problem so pgp

361
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:25,640
wrote a truck to see need to hold the
whole routing table in Internet sites

362
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:30,640
more than half a gig we need more than
half a gig of ram just to hold the

363
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,200
routing table passing each operating
system on top of it they need at least

364
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,839
one gig of ram but to connect to need to
then it exchange all you get are the

365
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:46,100
local roads so I can use a rotary high
five hundred mix or if you want to use

366
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:57,200
another critic so probably CCR 10:36
again

367
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:15,220
there was an Italian I think I'm using
me critique even as a trousers and and

368
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:21,220
it's appearing router so yes I've been
on this Suisse critique use a meeting or

369
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:32,299
a test well that's why I know that the
72 Corp Maltese coming up can learn

370
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,500
about BJP really B really

371
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:46,530
aryans real BGP the m42 that's it I
think it it's just DNA number forty two

372
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:51,140
you can connect to it all you need is a
public IP address somewhere you can rent

373
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:57,118
a cheap GPS and basically what you need
to find this someone else you establish

374
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:05,349
a VPN connection and from bpm 4242 also
uses private addresses you get your own

375
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:11,460
block from weaving en 42 and then you
start building a first repin connection

376
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:16,260
you build a PGP connection freudian food
that's one thing but you want more than

377
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,060
one connection so you start talking to
somebody else Indian 422 you build a

378
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,369
second VPN connection and you build a
second viewing and so on

379
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:29,380
en 42 is a big mission at work and
that's how I learned getting online

380
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:36,960
that's one way or the other way is you
go to talk to one of the local internet

381
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:45,109
registries like I am one it doesn't it
doesn't have to be serbian you talk to

382
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:52,319
an internet registry you get what you
pay them those 100 euros for the object

383
00:39:52,319 --> 00:40:00,140
and you get an actual number and you can
view 6 talked about before you don't

384
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:05,060
need to be four to learn and you connect
through VPN nobody says that you have to

385
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,150
use like Ethernet connections that can
you see p.m. as well

386
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:20,349
and then you're on the real internet but
if you up and if you do not announce you

387
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:23,130
can break the Internet

388
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:30,349
remember Pakistan telecom Pakistan
telecom couple of years ago announced IP

389
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:37,579
addresses from you too I even know how
why it happened they created a role in

390
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:44,410
their structure just a routing table and
pretty 2.2 nowhere but they forgot that

391
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:51,089
pointing route to know where is no made
away you get a big block and you want to

392
00:40:51,089 --> 00:41:00,520
announce the whole block so what happens
is their block by X went on the whole

393
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,829
internet so they basically what they did
was saying Dorado AR out these IP

394
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:13,750
addresses are mine alone sent them out
very efficient to block YouTube from

395
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:18,960
Pakistan but what they did biaxin was
telling the router these are my IP

396
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:26,650
addresses I'm by accident they told the
whole world that thing you can do what

397
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:33,190
you can work on futures so your ISP that
connects you to the internet also has to

398
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:37,339
be careful so if I to a soccer on my own

399
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:43,130
believe me I do enough mistakes in my
life that's why I'm telling my uplink

400
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:49,109
provider so this guy is announcing
something wrong I think I'll blocked

401
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:59,910
that white lists it very fragile it's a
very fragile system because they have

402
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:04,490
less than you have to bring on the
congress network you have to talk to all

403
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:10,288
the uplinks just your whitelist just I'm
going to use this network from we can

404
00:42:10,289 --> 00:42:15,460
but I'm keeping everyone busy for 15
minutes to fix the weightless

405
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:27,700
Switzerland what the hell is going with
more rate that's not mine I don't know

406
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,470
what happened with Norway because what
aidid walls first of all the IP

407
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:37,680
addresses stroll blechley park that some
piece of history for everyone here I did

408
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,399
your location along to do it and let it
to to show to the airport ski pole in

409
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,920
Amsterdam the language for the IP
addresses is set to friends so whoever

410
00:42:50,920 --> 00:43:00,540
gets French websites I had fun and the
IP addresses are a Chiefs 22 point to

411
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:09,350
serve the country code is serbia and my
companies facing threats and that's why

412
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:12,049
it's your location doesn't work

413
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:19,440
yes yes we got a separate number so the
set up like this year you can have on

414
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:28,450
your own home just talk to me and that's
from there onto the internet

415
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:33,520
exactly and we have one airs number here
and that's the balcony as number that's
