1
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,410
hello again

2
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:35,450
so I will talk to us about running your
fucking infrastructure good announcer so

3
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:43,100
hello McFly this microphone is slightly
to load still giving her talk about

4
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:52,180
runyon for inviting infrastructure I
have given this talk 123 times but

5
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,530
people still would like to hear it so
it's not an exclusive

6
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,309
done talk over here and I think that
more good talk should be recycled to

7
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:04,378
some of them are just happening not good
enough and definite reaching a big

8
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,280
enough info audience so I am talking
about running your own fucking

9
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:19,270
infrastructure I make flight that mean
those of you who have been on the camp

10
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,770
might have been many ways that's
basically the thing that I started which

11
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,990
is awesome

12
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:35,419
village that appears on conferences I
also do I did security for a business

13
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:43,349
for a living I do to finance the whole
millionaires things and I've been

14
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:49,890
hanging around this case computer clubs
and wild is it a tons of hackers basis

15
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:58,789
at like to give talks and conferences
because I always talk very much so why

16
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:06,140
are we having the stalk and try to get
some user feedback here who have you

17
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:12,800
does have an email address

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,290
I think those of you who don't have the
hands of belonging to be honest review

19
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,829
does not have an email address where you
can give chocolate

20
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:30,190
administrator or kick him in the ass and
get something is not working people

21
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,270
three people all the others of you have
the chance to give Chuck led to yet

22
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:41,980
menace traders will become important
later on the talks by the way doesn't

23
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:55,200
like chocolate ok very good so that's a
very good start this whole truckload

24
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,350
things become may become important later
depending on your country's some of the

25
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,870
things I'm talking about

26
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:11,470
might not be completely legal for you
that is specially is things manufacturer

27
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:17,620
on with the stuff still I also have a
different reason why I came up with this

28
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,330
the terms of conditions there is tons of
people who also have an email address

29
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,709
that is not with your provider who of
you

30
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:35,959
of those people have read the Terms of
conditions and I mean till the end one

31
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:45,380
person you've read the your lawyer
that's very good actually really in

32
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:50,019
terms of conditions is not only telling
you what they plan to do because in

33
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,730
their case they've read something like
we might be interest that you have a

34
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,738
look at your email for marketing
purposes

35
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,500
things like that the basically
translates to we will always read your

36
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,590
email and send you spam because of that
is really very entertaining to read

37
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,459
those terms of conditions more than once
or margins US one of those because

38
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,790
there's lots of funny things in there
and just sometimes can really see how

39
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,358
the people were sitting around the desk
in the world how do we formulated

40
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,400
there's that it doesn't sound too
intrusive

41
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,469
cuz that's what's happening so as you
have heard of its about storing data

42
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,460
about your details about your email
addresses but not limited to your email

43
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:40,570
addresses this basically goes about all
of your stuff that you can do online

44
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:49,289
there's goes from email do instant
messaging instant messenger

45
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:55,240
the alternative for that his job to
Instagram to Facebook to Twitter to your

46
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,870
weapon provider to your email provider
to whatever you choose to run your

47
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,960
digital life and if that's not you or
somebody from the hackerspace or

48
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:15,270
somebody you can give chocolate to you
running into those problems so far from

49
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:21,979
us to a half first of all which is today
pretty obvious is the government's have

50
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:29,060
access to your data and sadly that means
all of them I would go into details the

51
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,470
ledger but further things is that your
problem running into which is not too

52
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,510
obvious for a lot of people as other
things the provider which is selected to

53
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:45,669
run your digital life might modified
service or its terms of conditions I'm

54
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:49,520
pretty sure those of you and PayPal
account

55
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,620
have experienced that lately because
people are separated from eBay that came

56
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,599
with a gigantic change of tone terms of
conditions and depending on your country

57
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:03,190
the government worse because when they
have to change those they tend to put

58
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:08,270
all of those changes in one big change
the dude if you're not a lawyer lose the

59
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,789
overview of what everything about to
change these terms of conditions so in

60
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:17,289
the split of eBay and paper for example
a lot of these changed terms of

61
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:22,610
conditions changed a lot depending on
the country to the worse but there's

62
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:28,590
other things provide a might cancel the
service provider might modify date the

63
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,119
private provider might steal data

64
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,830
and provide I might get hacked so the
men Christmas who do you trust was your

65
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:48,060
digital data with your digital life the
most obvious one

66
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,290
the governments have access five years
ago would say at least ten years ago we

67
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,010
had a discussion last night if it's five
years of its seven years of it like that

68
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:05,630
meant basically when somebody was doing
surveillance on cloud products dus the

69
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,500
five eyes us' United Kingdom Canada and
New Zealand and Australia were reading

70
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:21,130
your digital life today that means
basically any government that asks can

71
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:28,550
read that just if you have ever worked
in a provider that supplies stores part

72
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:35,000
of your digital life you will find that
in the last 34 years the situation

73
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,280
changed a lot and where you five years
ago might get a letter from a German

74
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,849
government as a general provider 1950 s
government today you will get those

75
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:51,580
letters from basically countries all
over the world which is sometimes funny

76
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,139
when you get effects of your fax machine
which is Arabic and nobody translated to

77
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:02,620
English they just sent the Arabic text
you kind of interesting if you're the

78
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,320
person that had to deal with all those

79
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:11,099
government led related let us with
certain fax number when you suddenly

80
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:18,190
look at a language where you have to
think about where this comes from one of

81
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,940
them said things is for a German usually
it used to be that they basically need a

82
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:31,990
warrant for that today that is not
anymore the case in most countries the

83
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:39,470
mandatory warrant by Judge have in a lot
of countries

84
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:47,620
weekend up i think is the correct term
for that today you will need less police

85
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,350
can come like this is a very urgent case
we need this now

86
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,340
lot of countries they don't need a
warrant they only needed for and when

87
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,320
they have enough time so you can easily
see what that goes to imagine being a

88
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,740
policeman and having these two old
alternatives one I have enough time any

89
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,630
different to I don't have enough time I
can just sent us to think what would you

90
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:21,870
think so now we're coming to the less
obvious stuff the provider might modify

91
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:29,850
the service the most common changes that
you most likely also have experience is

92
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,260
the provider my charger money for
something that has been free before this

93
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,250
is actually very common markets tragedy
for new companies to get into the market

94
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:45,720
that provide a service for wild for free
and when the people have gotten addicted

95
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,810
to the service because they use it and
now parts of the digital life is at that

96
00:09:49,810 --> 00:10:00,750
provider they don't really have an
alternative when suddenly it costs money

97
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:09,800
provider my counselor service provider
might come to the point that he finds

98
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,810
out that the product is supplying the
cost some money money as in service

99
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,770
running in a datacenter money as an
administrator said that run those

100
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:24,990
services and those data centers and
money in developers that read those

101
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,480
service and then there is the overhead
of the product engineer the products

102
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,720
managers and all the other stuff that
comes with the sub and that comes with

103
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,800
hiring and employing thirty to forty
people or even more when the biggest

104
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,670
service LinkedIn fingers meanwhile
governor both the one thousand people

105
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:53,240
area just for the tech dept and you need
an HID partner and lots of costs that

106
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,260
come with costs and people getting
employed so it's totally understandable

107
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:04,010
that some products that don't really
fulfill the hopes of the responsible

108
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,920
product manager gets shut down

109
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,959
think you know some examples and hear
the Google Reader is one of the examples

110
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:21,710
that I think actually quite a lot of
people used Google Wave good health but

111
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:26,330
also other cities like gives city does
anyone have you even remember what city

112
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:32,620
is it was yeah that's like six seven
people here it's a while ago

113
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:39,680
megaupload is also kind of clothes
because of the way they wanted to

114
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,819
dodgeball Microsoft zune did anyone of
you use that that's a problem for them

115
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,830
but those people who used it were kind
of double fact in this way because they

116
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,170
got a shitty service not to the service
was over my crib basically said you have

117
00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:00,110
no two weeks time to download all of the
software you have that came to this

118
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,930
music all of the stuff you have paid for
you have two weeks of time to download

119
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:09,719
it and then switch off the service so a
lot of people lost their music

120
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,389
because the digital rights management
software there was used in Zune

121
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:18,740
disconnecting back to the Microsoft
service and if it can't reach the server

122
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:24,420
it will not play the music which is kind
of shitty when Microsoft then decides to

123
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:45,150
shut down the servers

124
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:56,400
Nintendo Wii connect 24 was also an
example then thank you for that nice

125
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,569
next point is and that is what even less
people have their screen is the provider

126
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:08,180
might money failure data review runs a
YouTube channel

127
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:14,699
many ppl 123456 people did you ever had
the case that somebody modified your

128
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,290
videos like for example tried to use
commercial music there were removed the

129
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:27,010
sound that is quite easy thing recorded
video where you say fuck go to Europe

130
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:34,000
played its still says fuck good america
watch the same video the bball the fuck

131
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,760
you laughing about that is modifying
data actually that's in some cases

132
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:48,260
actually in most cases I would thing
violating your intellectual property and

133
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:53,960
other things that might modified which
is not so is the privacy settings on

134
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,730
Facebook this because a lot of interest
of setting your profile as public as

135
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,390
possible because that's how this works
people can find you people get on

136
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:06,560
facebook more people come to the plate
from more ads for more people they can

137
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,530
sell so the clothes privacy settings
they kind of have to do really annoys

138
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:16,020
them so from time to time she might have
experienced that the privacy settings

139
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:20,810
get updated the whole system got
replaced with a slightly changed to

140
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,890
simply because it's too complicated my
dread that from the outside into the new

141
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:28,939
setting they just put everybody back to
the fold which then is everything is

142
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:35,620
visible to everybody

143
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:42,050
the provider might steal data that is
actually kind of a harsh word and the

144
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,829
providers would you reject that because
they tell you so and the terms of

145
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:54,940
conditions which i think do three people
here reading for some companies that

146
00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:04,200
even the business case bit ly tinyurl
their case is their work with detecting

147
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,710
trends over things that get shot over
their services and other stuff in this

148
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:15,279
case they're not a person licensed but
it's still there taking your data and

149
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,640
working with that while they do tell you
that the terms of conditions are we dig

150
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,760
down there but not really openly they
give you the impression that if you

151
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,600
share something I just sometimes can
even set a password which gives you the

152
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,560
impression this is no private wise the
other was a pass route which is just

153
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:42,699
totally not an Instagram reviews in
using Instagram 12345678 people still

154
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,470
you have read the Terms of conditions of
Instagram right did you ever read the OP

155
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:52,900
actually very interesting source the
business reports they do the business

156
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,550
reports they do for shareholders and
potential shareholders and investors

157
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:03,359
they show what their business case is
which is an explanation for how do we

158
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:11,000
plan to make money with this thing and
for Instagram the cases they're selling

159
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,050
pictures and the nice thing about
user-generated content is you don't have

160
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:25,050
to take the pictures yourself to take
pictures they just said a web page where

161
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,459
people can upload pictures can showroom
the pictures and they sell those

162
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:35,400
pictures if you upload a picture to
Instagram there is a chance that a

163
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,000
custom 04 say laundry machines might be
interested in your pictures and want to

164
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,480
buy it for an advertisement campaign
wears as long as this happening with

165
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:53,519
a laundry machine that's not really so
bad but there are companies out there

166
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,220
that self things like erotic images and
they also need sometimes background

167
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,400
pictures you gave them the permission
and for a while it was even stated

168
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,209
explicitly it's not the case anymore at
the moment they just might sell your

169
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:12,970
picture doesn't say anything about that
but for a while there were even

170
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:19,010
explicitly saying we might sell your
picture even maybe truer to service

171
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,359
providers that do things like erotic
things on their removed that and

172
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:28,809
everybody was happy with Instagram that
they removed it which i think is really

173
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:35,928
helpful but yeah Instagram for example
is an example of a company that lives

174
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:43,710
out of selling the user-generated
content to other companies or two

175
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:48,250
shotted up there is stealing your data
and selling it for themselves that's a

176
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:58,020
business case providers might abuse your
data so that's an interesting case

177
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:08,910
somebody said to set up a web service
and then uses the user-generated content

178
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,410
that comes out of that in a way that is
completely different

179
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:18,380
usually they claim that is done to
improve service quality and security for

180
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:25,760
example Microsoft Skype Prefecture links
and if this link you provided as

181
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,900
protected with a password that rang the
words before after that just rather

182
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:37,720
sounds insane because they would expect
that if you send a link that is

183
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,370
protected by a password that you try
something that you also send this user

184
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,418
name the password for the just trying
the stuff

185
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:50,970
rhonda which is kind of interesting if
you have the chance to read the logfiles

186
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:56,029
which you actually only can if you're on
your own fucking infrastructure

187
00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:06,759
other cases in there is the abuse of
Health coming cases there is LinkedIn

188
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,889
and Facebook that embed the stuff in
other sites where you don't necessarily

189
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:18,549
want to have that most likely also
without the use it's also what things is

190
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:28,989
linked in the shower or Gmail or do you
know what we love you does know what ok

191
00:19:28,989 --> 00:19:35,549
fifty figuration interface that for
example where you can allow Facebook to

192
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:41,019
access your Gmail account and the
address book

193
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:49,559
they very often advertisers as connects
York hounds read these terms of

194
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,539
conditions here and then they see for
you see for example if you connect your

195
00:19:53,539 --> 00:20:01,009
Gmail account to your linked and we will
send out an invitation to every contact

196
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:04,229
in your address book

197
00:20:04,229 --> 00:20:11,820
Bollington and their selves as expand
your network and all the stuff which is

198
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:17,999
not necessarily too nice but that's not
all they do a facebook for example also

199
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:22,729
asked how many emails you have sent to
that person we're still on the servers

200
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:29,219
that is something that I think Facebook
doesn't need to know but again read the

201
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:35,070
terms of conditions it's all in there
and the last point this is a hacker

202
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,559
conference this might be the most
entertaining slide for you possibly and

203
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:49,759
its by if not complete so there was for
example a website which must have you

204
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:58,659
most likely knew which Dorrell was did
Sony get hacked this week dot com

205
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:04,059
you can just call it its answers with
yes or no but there's also a godaddy was

206
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:08,879
dropped parks wells had several times
AT&T lost their customer database

207
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:15,840
because the only way they're protected
the data was number eight the customer

208
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:22,330
number so you you're all in this case
because AT&T customers that case was

209
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:29,799
about Apple products customers at AT&T
you will use a one-year user 23456789

210
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:35,379
and the security was they send you a
link was please download euro stuff for

211
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:40,859
your activation of Apple products to
customers use nine so see aidid equals

212
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:51,099
nine in the Euro so this way that is
true that will feel that somebody went

213
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:57,879
in jail for that for posting for
pointing out that AT&T was supposed to

214
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:03,359
go to jail for that that AT&T just
enumerated the URLs

215
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:09,820
Activision Blizzard's LivingSocial which
is kind of us social thingy social media

216
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,960
thing again

217
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:20,149
rocky you and lately actually medicine
which kind of had the army of robot act

218
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:30,590
but this is actually a pretty big case
because just imagine how big does anyone

219
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,539
become a target if they have personal
data potentially interesting personal

220
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:41,889
personal data and potentially just
validated email addresses if you have a

221
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:45,779
look in the digital market one of the
points with personal debtors that you

222
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:50,809
can actually sell that for a very fight
email address you will roughly get three

223
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:59,509
to five euros at the market at the
moment so customer database was one

224
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:05,989
million users and 1 million validated
email addresses where you can see how

225
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:08,650
long or when they have been a sector

226
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:14,440
is actually for somebody who knows how
to find those market a very interesting

227
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,720
just moneywise very interesting case and
this is why this is so dangerous

228
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,130
yes this model to happen was your
website and how many users to have their

229
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:34,060
five so it's 25 euros and not five
million so yes there is more to get a

230
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:40,129
big providers and that increases the
interest of people to go for those

231
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:47,030
things so the main question that comes
up with this is what are your interests

232
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:54,020
and what are the interests of the
provider are your interests and you

233
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:02,300
provide us interest really the same in
Germany in the case that running a

234
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:09,950
business is defined on the point of the
will to generate money out of that I

235
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:17,080
give you do something to make money for
it that's business and that is actually

236
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,679
the case most of the providers are
business cases that are really really

237
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:26,180
only interested in making money because
that is how they keep their investors

238
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,680
happy they might have the idea to always
run something really nice but still

239
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:39,660
ahead investors which they need to keep
happy so then you to make money so the

240
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:46,440
data keeping your dead US AV is only
interesting to your provider as long as

241
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:53,890
this gives some extra money if you don't
pay extra for security if you do I'm not

242
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:59,910
there because of security provider
doesn't really have an interest of

243
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,300
securing your data

244
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:09,040
you might say but yes but if my provider
guide heck people will less people will

245
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:16,879
buy the service but think about that
Sony was hacked in the number of three

246
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,890
digit maybe four digit cases

247
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:26,080
still people by Sony products it didn't
really have an impact on the market

248
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,320
numbers for Sony it's not true from
other some companies some companies

249
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,550
didn't survive being hacked I actually
would forecast that Ashley medicine will

250
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:41,590
not survive the last gets this company
will in my forecast not be there in one

251
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:45,290
year there will be two other companies
who tried to take over the market of

252
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:52,590
giving man the impression that robots
like them but I doubt that they will

253
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:58,399
still be there so there is actually
service provider whose interests are

254
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,520
perfectly aligned with years and thats
yourself if you go to the hackerspace

255
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:12,070
it's not completely aligned but it's way
more aligned and I'm pretty sure you

256
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:18,720
have seen this phrase which is really
important if the product is free

257
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,620
there's two cases actually there is
mostly just one case if the product is

258
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,570
for free

259
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:34,490
the product if facebook offers you free
accounts to Daniel user's life and all

260
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:38,240
the stuff on there you're the product
that they are selling and they're also

261
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,510
sending advertisement to people go there
because all the other people there the

262
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:50,670
other product and when people go there
they can solve them ads when you go that

263
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:58,250
you owe them the product I wanna make a
disclaimer here

264
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:03,960
governments and hackers will nearly
always get access to your data with

265
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:10,530
enough resources cloud services make
that for the government

266
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:15,760
pretty easy because it means that they
need to go to the folder of the template

267
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,900
take one of the templates change 326
values print that put that in effect

268
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,820
machine they still use facts

269
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,510
unbelievable they still use all the fax
machines

270
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:34,170
and send it to the company and they were
never get the dead because nearly no

271
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:38,760
company today will try it will not do
that because then then a world of pain

272
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:47,900
from the government's from other
governments really hacking into a box

273
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:53,250
that run somewhere in a datacenter is a
large more costly than sending a piece

274
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:58,210
of paper for that you just need a
training in the law department for the

275
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:05,190
other stuff you actually need a hacker
that actually knows what he's doing

276
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:13,100
maybe you just need to buy enough that
looking for your data is not that easy

277
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:20,810
anymore that they don't need for week
trained kitty that uses the last rule

278
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:25,790
but they read need really proper heck
and really need some 0 dis again in your

279
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:30,950
data if you updated completely so what
it means the you can alter the variables

280
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:37,000
in the cost per surveillance accrue
equation there that's actually not too

281
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:46,040
hard ok I made this talk while ago for
the first time and I made the slides of

282
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,990
a while ago and you possibly song that
there is not a lot of argument about

283
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:55,220
government when I made the slights that
was different I had to explain people

284
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:01,920
that yes really some governments really
do spy on you

285
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:09,680
this guy made it a lot easier he told us
that basically all governments are

286
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,520
trying to spy on everybody when they can
not even regarding that it might be

287
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,300
interesting for them at that moment but
it might be interesting later even and

288
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,230
that is even enough reason to stop the
state to get a copy of your data and to

289
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:31,470
stop this he told us about prison and
all the other products products because

290
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:36,560
that's what it is to the end is a prism
is a product for them and it was not the

291
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:43,280
first project that was used there were a
lot of other things was Trailblazer

292
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,800
there was turbulence Red Hook connie was
and very very early in the beginning a

293
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:58,610
cologne so who have you have heard about
prison and the reuse of snow that is

294
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:02,399
half of the people is the other people
too lazy to raise the arms or did you

295
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:13,340
really not raised about this ok who have
you have heard about Connie 1345 used to

296
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:17,750
see where he's going i think quite a lot
of people is so that some people started

297
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:22,540
typing has like 10 seconds after I got
into the slide this actually some of

298
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:27,550
them are really interesting projects not
all of them worked in the way they were

299
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:32,730
intended and some interesting and funny
side effect as problems were sometimes

300
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:37,150
know he'll areas to read on the internet
you really should do that and inform

301
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:41,250
yourself about that but yea prisoners
just the one that got the large media

302
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,810
intention you just saw here by yourself

303
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:48,970
everybody'd know and his brother and
sister knows about that while the other

304
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:55,530
project that was not the case so

305
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:02,730
I just told you to what do not do we
need to get to things that you can do so

306
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:08,450
have you what has been called by a guy
that he's never in here and who have you

307
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:14,420
has ever seen a hackerspace as a group
of people he hangs around with you maybe

308
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:21,350
not not everybody is may be able to run
the stuff by themselves but for things

309
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,199
like for example hecker spaces or groups
team up

310
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,230
get the best people in your space in
your group to set up something like this

311
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:39,250
and run it just felt like a space is
really a good case for that for a long

312
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,190
time has been given style and a
requirement to have you an email address

313
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:48,100
to get on the interesting meaningless
I'm from the computer club we have an

314
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,620
email this that called in turn the tv
online email which is the first German

315
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:56,870
Mars you must provide other was for free
you for a long time just didn't get on

316
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:01,610
there nobody was subscribing you people
were laughing at you when you're posting

317
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:08,290
with that today we would have a pretty
big amount of people that even to serve

318
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:15,090
strategy internal email lists with the
gmail account which is kind of shitty

319
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:21,990
because just one person on this mail
address is enough that then the services

320
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:28,180
can read this mailing list if you have
150 well-protected people on the mailing

321
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,130
list that all run their own
infrastructure on their own service of 1

322
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,430
people that you subscribe that is under
gmail from that moment on waist strap

323
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:42,710
that person this list is read by the
government and the services so that is

324
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:48,550
something that we actually need to
change back and I think we have the

325
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:55,639
ability to do that thing from mailed
service there's actually a lot of things

326
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:01,580
that you can run I'm not reading all of
those because I think all of you

327
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,428
Telligent enough to be able to reach
yourself

328
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:14,730
I really we haven't I can know if
anybody's interest that I can show him

329
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:22,330
the example we are running after the
country after this talk but all of those

330
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,408
things can be run by yourself

331
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:31,690
actually not really complicated so yes
running your own infrastructure will

332
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:36,730
require a change the culture again
because our culture has changed over the

333
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:43,389
last decade from needing to run all the
stuff from doing all the stuff to even

334
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:51,508
get into the group of those people to
today it's totally free to use Gmail and

335
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:53,690
I mean we in serbia here

336
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:58,799
gmail is an american products primary
the american government will be reading

337
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,710
this

338
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:08,240
if you run your own infrastructure you
will solve most of the issues we're

339
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:21,259
talking about and so if you would like
to still continue that that if you're

340
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:27,339
aware of the problems you're running
with it and if it's OK for you all the

341
00:34:27,339 --> 00:34:33,649
involve people on the mailing list the
people on the mailing list then just do

342
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:39,569
that but at least a while ago that was
not the common approach and that is I

343
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:45,129
think we should give good back 20 yeah
that's this is for example something

344
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:49,830
this is what we do with many ways many
ways is not a hackerspace it's kind of a

345
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:55,429
group of people to try to make free beer
and free food for other people on hecka

346
00:34:55,429 --> 00:35:02,849
camps and it works awesome I want
product when you want to speak this is

347
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:10,000
kind of this small Chinese metal
thingies that we have and yeah things

348
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,400
like drug called off Cardiff would you
can do is include her very easily

349
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,190
modified starch reuse see file for that
read my mind to organize your

350
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:24,920
hackerspace your group's your projects
within that read mine is a mix of a

351
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,300
ticket system was ticket system with
Vicky and some for the mod things you

352
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:36,609
need for stuff and other pet clearly
missing here is the rekey which reason I

353
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:46,520
don't know forgot there anyway so if you
have to run with a lot of stuff you have

354
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,240
to have your own lot of stuff you have
to deal with a lot of administrative

355
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,200
work just one side note if you do this
for more than five six seven users write

356
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,089
scripts and stop doing that early
because if you don't you will have to

357
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:04,730
deal with that get for my dad kind of my
hand that good entered into the database

358
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:10,290
by Emmanuel SQL query for example later
on the script is that and for example to

359
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:14,130
things like testing all the very old
said so

360
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:21,150
stripped all the stuff early I also
recommend using LDAP for that but I need

361
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,640
to point out that the common
implementation we have at the moment

362
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,960
being open is the biggest pain in the
ass that has been run over myself over

363
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,849
my administrative work even setting up a
simple held up can take a group of

364
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:41,880
people there is no I'm not joking
because the whole concept and the whole

365
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:49,059
way like will view has ever seen an
OpenLDAP conflict file then you possibly

366
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:54,190
do understand what I mean right I see
nothing people there

367
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:57,869
yeah but its work to do that because if
you have your scripts and the and the do

368
00:36:57,869 --> 00:37:01,890
that it's actually pretty nice to do so

369
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:07,230
something we're trying out at the moment
is to not use anymore but migrated to

370
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:13,809
privacy idea which has the nice feature
that it also adds to factorization

371
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:21,349
I personally like the UK there which can
be implemented very very easily into the

372
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:29,950
system this way but privacy idea would
be enough for it on talk so we're coming

373
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,640
to an end I hope I'm not rushing too
much and we just 15 minutes in the top

374
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,390
10 yes this is the first things like I
would like to think the american

375
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:46,328
government because by employing snowden
and then fucking too many things that

376
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:50,750
made this talk a lot easier and it took
roughly 12 slides out of the store which

377
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:58,799
are just not needed anymore today but I
would also like to express thank you for

378
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:05,650
all the administrators that do things
for me and so should you remember the

379
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:12,329
truck let me thank you to you
administrator from time to time it's

380
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:18,269
worth it and also would like to thank
you all the people in the military that

381
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:22,839
helped me during the slide in these
things so that means we're not coming to

382
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:37,549
questions announces does anyone of you
have a question or even two or three

383
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:47,640
you mentioned fund earlier in the dark
blonde in a synchronous series no

384
00:38:47,640 --> 00:39:05,560
mention it a pond sorry for my bad
english and german it's not my native

385
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:18,990
language anybody else was questions you
ask them a repeat them I don't know did

386
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:28,129
you mention that you can use on simple
to configure your interests and a simple

387
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:40,640
makes things a lot easier I just want
and simple

388
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:48,970
yes I don't use that there is lots of
talk to lots of tools that make your

389
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:55,740
life easier if you know how to use them
I encourage people if you have somebody

390
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,640
in the group that knows how to use them
to use them so in general yes I think

391
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,480
that's a good idea just for me and
personal I haven't used it we haven't

392
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:11,230
used it but yes I would recommend if you
have somebody who has knowledge was that

393
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:16,279
you that makes you love a lot easier

394
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:25,500
any more questions

395
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:34,700
21

396
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:40,098
then thank you for listening to the talk
I hope those of you who is still in the

397
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:45,390
group on the hackerspace is still used
mostly Gmail and other stuff will go

398
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:50,790
home after this weekend and try to set
up

399
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:56,079
deleted run it at your own it will take
a while to migrate stuff over you cannot

400
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,339
just go there delete everything you will
need the emails you will need the other

401
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:05,000
stuff you will have to set up things you
have to play around with them this takes

402
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,400
some days and then you can all move that
over Gmail for example you can very

403
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,140
easily migrate to a normal mail server
by just for example Thunderbird and just

404
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:25,440
coming into over works awesome ok thank
you and have a nice day at the park on
