1
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:43,970
so next up we have careless with the

2
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:49,430
leak of billions of passwords cold

3
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:54,350
winter morning in Russia Ivonne comes

4
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:58,100
back from his work to his family he

5
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:01,040
spent his whole adult life working this

6
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:04,360
trade working in this business it's been

7
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:10,039
dealing with copyrighted works he's

8
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:13,880
creating added value creating written

9
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,310
documents creating authorship and today

10
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:21,020
he found out that someone has stolen his

11
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:26,450
life's work and is reselling it at the

12
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:29,300
cheaper price this is a story of Yvonne

13
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:33,020
or maybe he's called some other way in

14
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:37,970
real life and how he lost control of his

15
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,509
stash of passwords so before we get to

16
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,530
that story

17
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:45,380
let me explain for those of you who are

18
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:50,480
new to the criminal underworld of of the

19
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:51,800
IP how passwords leaks work any end

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,020
users here anyone who would consider

21
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,110
themselves not a hacker not a programmer

22
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,600
just you know interested in computers

23
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:02,210
yeah we have some ok so some of the end

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,890
users would say that you know strong

25
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:08,508
password is important and everyone says

26
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:10,818
that ends true but the leaks don't

27
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:14,450
happen from your from your end device so

28
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:18,040
mostly it's not your phone or your

29
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:22,488
laptop or your computer that gets hacked

30
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,920
by sheer volume most passwords come from

31
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:27,980
your service being hacked like for

32
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,329
example in in in the old days well

33
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,730
actually we don't have to go back to the

34
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:34,069
old days Facebook gets hacked together

35
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,119
here and there right so large companies

36
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:38,399
do get hacked and they they did get

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,129
and then it happens even more so that's

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,910
where the leaks come from the the normal

39
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:48,000
scenario of how password lists come to

40
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,910
be so we can't even or or whomever I

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,769
don't know his real name

42
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:56,060
but according to the candles it appears

43
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:58,590
it's it's it's a male but who knows so

44
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,540
even if I was gonna hack stuff but

45
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,720
before that we have a user let's call

46
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:08,310
him Bob you see him on the screen user

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:11,239
would register to one or more of online

48
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,410
sites let's say he's a blacksmith so he

49
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,750
frequents blacksmithing forums he would

50
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,569
create an account Bob one two three this

51
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,360
password let's say password one because

52
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:23,640
you have to have digits in your password

53
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,709
and he would also create you know some

54
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,268
more accounts at some other forms for

55
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,640
example he loves to ride horses the

56
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,349
coursing forum maybe maybe a social

57
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,910
network like Facebook or something else

58
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:35,700
Twitter lights whatever you have but

59
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:40,139
then a hacker comes along and hacks one

60
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:42,869
of those services and the password

61
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:44,760
caches or the passwords are depending on

62
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,040
the configuration of the service will

63
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,760
get leaked the hacker will manage to get

64
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,920
them now what I have a small problem

65
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,649
with these days as a small side note is

66
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,179
is that researchers do not really

67
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:01,680
differentiate leaks and and open open

68
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,870
broken open databases anymore right we

69
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,359
just had this Facebook leak which was

70
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,730
scraped database not actually owned by

71
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:12,359
Facebook I'm still not sure if it's

72
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:14,099
actually a leak today because maybe you

73
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:17,579
just found it and didn't download and

74
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:19,589
and assumed okay there it is so there's

75
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,358
a different view that between that but

76
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,770
but leagues do happen and hackers when

77
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,570
they see that look like that they will

78
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,580
download the whole database and that is

79
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,310
a league that's what happens and a

80
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,669
different hacker might download some

81
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,830
other database and see our Bob here that

82
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:36,419
uses his username Bob one two three

83
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,639
because that is his username and his

84
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:42,539
password password one because that is

85
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,219
his password on all the sites will get

86
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:45,960
compromised on all the sides because the

87
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:47,900
password is the same right but there is

88
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,138
a site that Bob doesn't use and the

89
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:54,888
hacker gets that gets a database out of

90
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:56,930
that site so what happens then well in

91
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:59,150
the old days hackers was just you know

92
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,570
shared password list with friends these

93
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:05,090
days we have economics of crime not only

94
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,639
not only crime on the street also crime

95
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,099
online it's all quite well structured

96
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,229
quite quite a good here he actually said

97
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,080
what happens is they would sell in this

98
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:16,789
case for some rubles because I came to

99
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,880
the conclusion that that this leak

100
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:21,919
originated mainly or altogether in

101
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,250
Russia so for some rubles this would be

102
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,310
sold to someone who would then combine

103
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,400
all the leaks all the data in a huge

104
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:34,520
database and then go sell it on the

105
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,469
black market on the dark web usually

106
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,780
usually these these databases are not

107
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,370
readily available like to you and me if

108
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,619
you're not researching that you can't

109
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,449
just Google password database and and

110
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,460
get that you can get something else you

111
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:49,849
can get some some smaller databases some

112
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,169
leaks that have been reprocessed but

113
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:54,080
these original ones it's quite hard to

114
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:56,090
get so dark web or at the very least you

115
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,130
have to have knowledge you have to use

116
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,198
this grey grey web where you have to

117
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,330
know someone to get inside it's not on

118
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:04,430
darkened percent but you know it's hard

119
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,430
to get and then in this case it was

120
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,260
being sold for some dollars from two

121
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,870
other hackers and they have different

122
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,490
use for that they might use password

123
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,099
stuffing which means they take your

124
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,289
password and try it on other services on

125
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:20,599
all the services they can they will try

126
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:23,240
you username and password and see if

127
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,280
they can get in they might want it

128
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,539
because they won't steal your identity

129
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,369
or because they won't take over your

130
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:30,590
social networks anyone remembers the

131
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,900
hacks of around five years ago I think

132
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,719
we're we're Twitter users were targeted

133
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,219
for their short usernames so that

134
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,340
happens and these people are ready to

135
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:43,760
pay the the price it's not a high price

136
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,429
it's it's usually under a hundred

137
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,110
dollars for for this compiled password

138
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,770
user list without credit card numbers

139
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:54,500
and stuff like that but you know as it

140
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:58,150
happens in in free market especially in

141
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:01,130
free market that is a crime market some

142
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:02,120
users some hackers might do additional

143
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,680
illegal stuff and

144
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,310
illegal stuff on this picture here is

145
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,590
denoted by the red lines so they they

146
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:12,080
might you know try to resell it black

147
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,460
back on the black market say if it's

148
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,469
forty dollars I'm going to resell that

149
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,810
for twenty dollars of it if it's ninety

150
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,490
dollars okay how about $40 a better deal

151
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:22,040
same data everyone wins

152
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,650
right except the original creator of the

153
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,690
data well the users lose anyway so what

154
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,870
happens there and the last step is at

155
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:32,900
some point someone is going to also leak

156
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,090
the data somewhere outside the dark web

157
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,659
and it's gonna become available that's

158
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:40,880
when researchers get more easy access to

159
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,490
it and that's what happened here so

160
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,639
we're gonna take a look at some

161
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:49,280
screenshots of of the gray forum cracked

162
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,190
up to where where this stuff was

163
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:56,690
happening um so here with the profile of

164
00:07:52,190 --> 00:08:01,639
a hacker named corpse he called himself

165
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:03,800
ethical hacker and coder and there's a

166
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:07,160
line going through his nickname which

167
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,229
means that he's banned too bad you can

168
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,169
also see that that he's been there for

169
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:14,930
for less than a month we'll see what he

170
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:18,169
was doing there a bit later on

171
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,840
um this is advertisement for for the

172
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:22,820
leaks so it says you can buy cloud

173
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,320
access with combos which usually means

174
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,229
user name and something like user name

175
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,020
and password which is about one terabyte

176
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:32,120
of data and you can actually see all the

177
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:36,289
all the folders there that that are in

178
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:39,200
there and the access for life I mean for

179
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:41,949
for for eternity not for not jailson

180
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,320
it's real life so access for eternity is

181
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,910
$45 here so that's that's how it was

182
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,610
being being sold

183
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,230
this is Sonics here selling selling this

184
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,320
stuff not anymore I think it's not being

185
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,870
sold anymore and and Clorox was doing

186
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,209
something similar on the forum so now

187
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,279
back to corpse here we can see that

188
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:03,050
corpse has posted collection one

189
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:08,570
collection to collection to collection

190
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:09,650
three four and and so on and all of the

191
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,510
collections here the links are available

192
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:14,150
to four members only but that doesn't

193
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,430
matter what's interesting here is the

194
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,560
note he added so he says

195
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,359
I'm the creator of these collections the

196
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,310
reason why I leaked my own collections

197
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,860
which I used the cells because sanics

198
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:27,650
were sold them and scammed people so

199
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:31,520
yeah he decided to take soundings out of

200
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:33,800
business out of out of stealing his

201
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:38,930
business and out of his business and and

202
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:41,469
got wild medias he says himself and then

203
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:44,060
we have a different different user here

204
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:48,290
with some interesting comments toward

205
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:50,420
Sonics as well but some people some

206
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,189
hackers on the forum also also made my

207
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,339
job easier by actually combining

208
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:58,940
everything into into one needs download

209
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:00,980
so that made stuff easier that's how the

210
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,640
leaks happened this happened in January

211
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,420
2019

212
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:07,850
it started end of 2018 and happen in

213
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,990
general 2019 but the question is one of

214
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,390
the questions that we have when

215
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:14,720
researching stuff like that is how old

216
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:17,569
is a database if the leak to the gray

217
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,730
area to the gray net or the open

218
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,380
Internet happened in January this year

219
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,760
does that mean that the passwords are

220
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,950
actually if January this year no it

221
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,150
doesn't necessarily mean that so that's

222
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,820
one of the questions we can look at

223
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,590
before that so we download everything we

224
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,620
take a look at what we have this one we

225
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:35,180
have mostly text files yay so 4/5

226
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,130
our text files which means they should

227
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,310
be easy to process and and then we have

228
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:43,250
some archives which is no she's not that

229
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:45,109
nice because for one that means that if

230
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,900
you say but I want there by Drive to

231
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,070
analyze this and you field almost one

232
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,530
terabyte was this you can't really

233
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,210
extract anywhere and and the other

234
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,250
aspect is that the text files usually

235
00:10:53,210 --> 00:11:00,440
compress quite nicely which means that's

236
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:02,450
going to be a lot lot daytime before I'm

237
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,150
compressing it of course we look around

238
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,280
if you look again at this slide here we

239
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:10,970
can have a bunch of other formats 0.4%

240
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,079
other and the question what kind of

241
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,670
things we have there all we have

242
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:18,050
interesting stuff in there for example

243
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:21,099
we have a word document it says in

244
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:23,599
Russian we are renting out this website

245
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,840
not selling we're renting it out and

246
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,980
what we see on the slide actually is

247
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,210
rankings for different keywords on

248
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,310
different search engines so you

249
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,900
you know by by the step and do your

250
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,689
dirty business or maybe legitimate

251
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,189
business if you rent this hopefully

252
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,990
heard of companies

253
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:42,080
legitimate companies a newspaper in

254
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,600
Latvia that are renting their domain

255
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,700
name like not from not from the registry

256
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,100
from some third party so maybe somebody

257
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:53,270
is no business medusa - so why was it

258
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:55,520
there i'm not sure i have two equally

259
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:57,800
likely possibilities either someone was

260
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,790
trying to advertise their site business

261
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,650
or they just don't care what they put up

262
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,089
there because because the quality of

263
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,370
that stuff is quite low there's

264
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,710
everything in there for example the

265
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:14,930
rules of this war document it actually

266
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:16,760
has active warhead active links to to

267
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,859
the database administration system of

268
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,569
where this was copied out from so we

269
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,150
open up that attacker opened up the

270
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,980
system control AC control v in the

271
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:28,130
document and there we go

272
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,540
there is also pictures and just random

273
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,120
random pictures in there because you

274
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:35,569
know why not the the message there says

275
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,180
in russian fight me then we have some

276
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:40,430
Python scripts i would love if for every

277
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,010
separate database there would be a

278
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:48,349
script to process it so this opens up a

279
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:52,069
specific dom DHD and processes it in in

280
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:54,230
in in a format that's easily easily

281
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,870
usable in python later on unfortunately

282
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:59,510
there are only like four or five of

283
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,250
scripts like that and the structure is

284
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,980
basically we have all dumps from

285
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:07,220
everywhere as we will see in in a minute

286
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,440
and since it all happened just by

287
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,260
holding data from different leaks which

288
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,020
overlap in time because as i told you if

289
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,450
a leak happened you don't know how fresh

290
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,870
that fresh data is and sometimes data

291
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:24,680
gets leaked again it happened once again

292
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:27,250
in Latvia where I come from so there was

293
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,250
a huge

294
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,510
but there was a huge storm in the press

295
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,069
press was saying oh my god the

296
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,560
government was hacked because the

297
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,540
passwords of their system leaked and

298
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,709
it's through their leaks yes and they

299
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,939
had the email addresses of their

300
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,950
customers

301
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,870
so mostly Latvian citizens and they had

302
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,120
the passwords associated to those

303
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,400
accounts but the leaked happened for

304
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,540
them years ago and we already talked

305
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,250
about that four years ago but that's

306
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,890
someone font again sent to the press hey

307
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:56,020
a leak so that stuff happens and it

308
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:59,439
happens too - black hat hackers as well

309
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:01,120
they they also sometimes we include the

310
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,180
same stuff again in the league because

311
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,280
filenames changed cache Sims may go may

312
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:10,750
change if you had a carriage turn the

313
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,850
end so if we don't look at these small

314
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:16,860
changes right if we just look at the

315
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:19,930
files as such using hash Sims one force

316
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,870
was matching something already in there

317
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:25,479
so basically that's good for me because

318
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,070
I have less the process but after

319
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,040
removing duplicates at this point I

320
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,870
extracted everything of course and even

321
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,150
better picture appears almost everything

322
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:37,840
is text which is good because text is

323
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:39,670
easy to process I will tell you about my

324
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,470
method to process them in one of the

325
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,910
slides so you can do that as well for

326
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,690
other data or for this date if you want

327
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:49,569
to repeat the the the research we do

328
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,350
have 0.1% empty files so that that's a

329
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,020
hacker thing

330
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:56,350
those of you who have been hacking for

331
00:14:53,020 --> 00:15:00,130
for let's say 20 years know that in the

332
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:02,740
so-called scene sometimes sometimes you

333
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,420
add files just for the filenames like it

334
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,070
happens in the piracy scene it happens

335
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,459
in cracking scene as well for your tool

336
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,390
we just put your message in the name of

337
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,610
the file and that's it in the files

338
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:17,470
empty so that happens a lot here as well

339
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:19,930
0.1% empty files so file size wise what

340
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,820
do we have we have after after the

341
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,339
extraction we have thirty seven

342
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,110
gigabytes collection one these are

343
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,200
before the extraction actually we have

344
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:31,780
10 times more collections two three four

345
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,670
five and auntie public apparently auntie

346
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,350
public is the name they use for database

347
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,760
that has never been published outside

348
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,280
the darknet

349
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,780
which is not the case anymore then we

350
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:45,040
have 12 billion

351
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:47,439
which is one file that's one file of 90

352
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,740
gigabytes and it's super clean it's like

353
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:54,100
username/password it's perfect so easy

354
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:57,100
to use then we have big DB big database

355
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:00,040
which is around 600 gigs obviously and

356
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,070
so that totals to about one terabyte of

357
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,560
data this is before the extraction when

358
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:08,290
we extract it we have one terabyte more

359
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,500
so we have two terabytes of data to

360
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,480
process it does take some time I've been

361
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,970
doing this research since since the lake

362
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,650
since February this is not the first

363
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,720
time I give a similar presentation but

364
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:22,480
this presentation has more data

365
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,490
different slices I'm looking at it a

366
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,320
different way because it takes a lot of

367
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,750
time to process for example extracting

368
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,060
one country entries for one country out

369
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,750
of two terabytes well out of the

370
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,699
database

371
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,700
I wouldn't call database out out of the

372
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:39,430
dump can take around four to five four

373
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,410
to five hours just just extracting one

374
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:46,839
one small country not like calm but like

375
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:49,810
data we so but in reality we have 900

376
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,470
gigs because once again we look at the

377
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,729
duplicates and what we see is that

378
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,800
there's a bunch of stuff wasted a bunch

379
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,270
of a bunch of space is being wasted just

380
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,219
because they don't care but that's

381
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,960
that's not their job that's my job to to

382
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,569
analyze the data to clean it up first

383
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,130
so that's how we see if after the

384
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:08,829
extraction duplicate data

385
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:11,050
dublicate files not entries more than

386
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:13,060
half so there you have it when you this

387
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,829
happens with potato chips a lot right

388
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:17,230
you buy the bag of potato chips and cow

389
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:21,760
food is there that's same same logic

390
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:23,560
happens here so how do we process them

391
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,849
after we have them down to these around

392
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:29,290
nine hundred gigabytes it's still a lot

393
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:32,409
of data the the first idea that people

394
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:35,110
who work with web development or

395
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:37,960
Microsoft tools have is usually hey

396
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:41,020
let's import it into the database which

397
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:45,040
is a super bad idea I didn't try it but

398
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:46,570
but I've my presentation collided with a

399
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,460
different different guy's presentation

400
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,500
at a closed event where I was presenting

401
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,000
this and he was doing a database style

402
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,590
even though it was highly optimized

403
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,100
databases his speeds were lower than

404
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,040
mine

405
00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:00,969
so my answer is of course no quarrels

406
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:04,210
and some more utils so those are super

407
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:07,870
nice if we're talking about hard drive

408
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,730
or or even salt solid-state drive it

409
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,739
gives you gives you line speed so the

410
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,140
bottleneck is usually usually the actual

411
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,990
the actual media or social connection to

412
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,240
the file that that you're working with

413
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,960
so it gives you super super nice speeds

414
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:25,600
I was working on a USB 3 a USB 3

415
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,420
attached hard drive of 4 terabytes or 3

416
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,500
turbos I think so the speeds were where

417
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,900
what I could get like a hundred

418
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,040
megabytes per second which is which is

419
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:37,720
as good as it gets

420
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:39,639
so anyone used find yeah yeah we kind of

421
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,760
people right anyone use any of these cat

422
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,970
grep WC yeah super super cool come on

423
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:49,480
they actually helped a lot then said

424
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,950
anyone anyone you said ok almost the

425
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,270
same amount as the previous that's good

426
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,940
said it's a bit more complicated but

427
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,620
it's also super nice and and and then we

428
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,690
have then we have the last one here

429
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,459
which which not that many people use but

430
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,350
in this audience I think I think we're

431
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,740
going to have more fans than usual so

432
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:08,379
who's heard couscous youth progress yeah

433
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:10,420
Thank You Martin yeah you told me about

434
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:13,390
that at this conference to earth tour

435
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:16,179
couple years ago

436
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:18,520
hey definitely ok I I managed I managed

437
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:24,250
to live without a wk

438
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:26,080
yes so but but I did use cut with Cu T

439
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,630
which which is not here

440
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,960
cut cut is oka WK is useful when you

441
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,910
have to swap field around because the

442
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,800
maintainer zuv cut do not want to

443
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,690
implement that yeah

444
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,340
but progress is super cool and a lot of

445
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,820
people have heard about it I that that's

446
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,428
great

447
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,800
I I heard as I said from from Martin

448
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:46,900
about about progress so it's a cockatiel

449
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,059
T you launch progress - M when you get

450
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,130
this on your screen so you don't have to

451
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:52,540
wait around indefinitely not knowing

452
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,880
what this what's the speed of your

453
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,409
operation is you can actually take a

454
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,410
look at the time remaining at the speed

455
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,730
because when you are launch a command

456
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,850
like that cut something something

457
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,890
Gaullist big emails which is like half a

458
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,980
terabyte file well not in this example

459
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:11,380
but in general then you don't want to

460
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,340
wait for 24 hours to find out that oh it

461
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,700
still hasn't finished

462
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:20,860
maybe my algorithm is bad so that's what

463
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:22,450
progress is cool so after processing all

464
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,040
the text files and I'm just talking

465
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,740
about text files here because I decided

466
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:31,270
I can I can just ignore the one percent

467
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:37,510
of of the files which are not not txt we

468
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:40,210
have this amount of records that is 26

469
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:43,000
billion seven hundred thirteen million

470
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:46,240
eight hundred sixty two thousand six

471
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,340
hundred eleven and if you if you stumble

472
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,410
upon any other presentations on the leak

473
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,350
and on the topic the number may may

474
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:55,420
differ because data quality is poor with

475
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,189
the exceptions at 12 billion file data

476
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,020
quality spores some text files have

477
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:03,070
binary data in them

478
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:04,690
zero zero characters zero s keys and I

479
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,270
had to filter that out and it might have

480
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:11,980
it might have changed the number of

481
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:15,040
entries so but still 26 billion entries

482
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:17,530
is is a lot right if you look at it from

483
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:21,070
this perspective it is basically three

484
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:23,800
and a half populations of Earth so

485
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,169
that's that's quite a lot and what do

486
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:31,919
you think what is the most popular

487
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:39,160
password amongst the 26 billion

488
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:41,950
huh bastards nah not password and now no

489
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:47,260
one has it yet come on this is gonna be

490
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:51,850
the winner it's it's one two three four

491
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:54,520
five six it's still that so it already

492
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,590
tells us a couple of things nowadays

493
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,179
majority of systems would not accept

494
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,610
this password there are still systems

495
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:02,350
that would but majority wouldn't five

496
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,120
years ago the largest commercial bank

497
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:07,840
and let me accepted that as a password

498
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,580
and that is why they were attacked but

499
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,850
but nowadays nowadays there's there's

500
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:15,909
change so 0.15 percent is is one two

501
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,889
three four five six but in in in the top

502
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:20,080
we see the other passwords that you

503
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,820
mentioned so we have we have a password

504
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,309
here and we have one two three four five

505
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:26,080
and estoppel I said password one is

506
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:28,450
actually not that common it's like top

507
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,879
top 50 or something so it's it's a

508
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,510
relatively secure password depends on

509
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,950
the resources of the attacker

510
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:40,059
so one thing one thing we did was the

511
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:42,910
data is we took a look at at the

512
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:45,490
distribution so some of the entries

513
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:47,160
actually had the IP address of where the

514
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,429
user was either logging in or

515
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:53,650
registering from but since there was no

516
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:55,960
no guarantee that it is a registration

517
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,730
IP address word that it is there at all

518
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,890
or that it's not a phone number instead

519
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:03,610
of an IP address we didn't go that route

520
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:06,330
also only minority of Records like less

521
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:08,290
than 10% had the IP address that's why

522
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,470
contrary these muscle researchers we

523
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:13,000
decided we should go ahead and look at

524
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:17,080
the email addresses which is not that

525
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,630
cool but we can't get answered one of

526
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:25,050
the questions that that we were asking

527
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:29,460
where did the link originate from so

528
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:34,059
dot-com domains more than 13 billion

529
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:35,770
entries so more than half where dot-com

530
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:37,540
email addresses that is obvious that

531
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:41,180
comm is the oldest one of the oldest

532
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:45,889
domains this TLD sorry

533
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:48,780
around six billion dot are you so Russia

534
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:52,590
then we have the next category which is

535
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:56,129
more than 1 billion they have Germany in

536
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:58,620
there and then we have some some more

537
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:01,380
countries coming in for example here for

538
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:04,560
more than half a billion we have net we

539
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:07,140
have France we have UK and and so on so

540
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,480
we see where the concentration is right

541
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,720
here for more than hundred millions we

542
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:18,360
have Italy Poland Czechoslovakia Japan

543
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:24,060
and Brazil of course and here so Canada

544
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:25,229
Ukraine Spain China Australia Taiwan and

545
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:28,200
dot e-d-u

546
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:31,920
so those are the popular ones and it

547
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:34,890
clearly begs the conclusion that Russian

548
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,210
hackers hacking Russian users it looks

549
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,370
like like that because that come is used

550
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,620
by ruin right and we have we have

551
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:43,260
somewhere here and and of course the

552
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:46,649
rest which is less than thirty thirteen

553
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,180
million now looking at the slide

554
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,640
even though looked at a couple of times

555
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:53,010
I'm not sure if if Antarctica actually

556
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,740
had then saying but isn't there well

557
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:57,720
anyway so if you zoom in on Europe this

558
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,250
is this is how it looks so you can try

559
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,050
to find your own country and and/or

560
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,460
understand the the probability that

561
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:04,139
you're in there that you're the man is

562
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:09,300
in there if anyone actually uses their

563
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:11,640
national dot dot TLD for email yeah we

564
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,980
have fifteen people doing that so yeah

565
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,590
you can you can take a look if you don't

566
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,030
want to download the two terabytes so

567
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:21,120
then of course it's interesting to look

568
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:23,460
at the government's because governments

569
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,580
use their national TLD for emails that's

570
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:30,470
what governments do and the u.s. is

571
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:34,189
number one with 44% then we have a UK

572
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:38,400
Australia and stuff like that right so

573
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:40,950
that's that particularly coming from

574
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,680
Latvia we have this rivalry between

575
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:46,170
between the Baltic States between

576
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,710
Estonia Latvian Lithuanian please don't

577
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:51,090
mix up Latvian to any

578
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:54,160
unless it's on purpose then it's funny

579
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:57,209
so so I want to take a look at at the

580
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:00,430
three Baltic state this is what I got so

581
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,570
these are unique email addresses and

582
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,940
this is the difference I've given a

583
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:08,530
similar talk before for this talk I've

584
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:11,860
actually done it right finally I mean I

585
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:14,260
had I had scientific explanation valid

586
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,330
explanation I think for why I didn't

587
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,250
remove duplicate duplicate entries

588
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:20,470
because it is quite possible that Bob

589
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,760
one two three uses the same email

590
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,220
address and the same password with

591
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,040
multiple sites it is quite quite

592
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,570
plausible but the date didn't make much

593
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,100
sense so I decided for resist

594
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:33,600
presentation I can filter all that out

595
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:37,270
and I only include every every user name

596
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:40,530
once right every unique user name once

597
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:43,150
in this this slide here um so

598
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:45,040
unfortunately when we can look at the

599
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:46,750
users and passwords it didn't make much

600
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,780
more sense just a bit more sense but

601
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:52,780
here Latvia is still the leader so we

602
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:55,030
still have a bunch more addresses from

603
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,428
from Latvia if you look at the Russian

604
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:59,980
population then Latvia leads Estonia

605
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:03,040
closely follows not like here Estonia is

606
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,990
is more than 50 percent under and and

607
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,909
loopy and it doesn't have almost doesn't

608
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,920
have Russian population so so it kind of

609
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:11,820
makes sense that Latvians are Latinas

610
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:14,470
are more targeted because much of the

611
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,928
information warfare of Russia extends

612
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:20,920
into into into Latvia and a bit into

613
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:22,420
Estonian as well ok but but since this

614
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:26,260
is a conference in the Balkans I

615
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:29,170
included now I'm struggling at how to

616
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:33,129
call them I'm gonna call them countries

617
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:35,230
I'm sure I'm sure you will forgive me if

618
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:36,820
any of those isn't the country but I

619
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:39,340
think it's safer for everyone if you

620
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,889
just call those three countries so we

621
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:45,280
have Montenegro Serbia and Yugoslavia in

622
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:48,160
there and we can see that compared to

623
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:51,639
the Baltic States it's nothing so Russia

624
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:55,890
is quite far away relative to to the

625
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:58,930
Baltic States so you know not that many

626
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:01,690
hits and for Montenegro it

627
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:03,070
me right so everyone well not everyone

628
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,990
but a lot of people have taught me just

629
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:06,639
because it's cool domain and not because

630
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,710
they're I feel like this Montenegro per

631
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,170
se this conclusion can be corroborated

632
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:13,150
by by a different set of evidence that

633
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:15,610
we will see in in some of the next

634
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,960
slides now here are some slides and in

635
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,820
the slides we'll finally for the first

636
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,010
time ever in the history of me

637
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:24,669
presenting on this topic will be made

638
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:26,140
available today on my site so you can

639
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:29,440
take a look at all that later but here

640
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:33,070
we have top domains for every TLD of

641
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,170
those 60 lbs so we have of course e we

642
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:38,889
have Elte of course

643
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:41,170
for example 1lt here is is a top it's

644
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:43,570
quite popular 102 any code OTE is

645
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:46,000
popular email to Roger in Estonian for a

646
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,720
lot to inbox at LV is basically the the

647
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,420
popular one

648
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,270
but the thing singer here is that one L

649
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,860
way which is placed number two has not

650
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:56,980
been functioning as an email provider

651
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:58,990
for the past five or ten years and and

652
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:01,900
we have quite a lot of females coming

653
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:04,570
from there so we I would like to

654
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:06,550
conclude from this data that that means

655
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,260
data is super old and crappy but it also

656
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:10,240
might mean that users don't care

657
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:13,030
updating their email addresses they just

658
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,770
create an account 10 years ago and they

659
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,460
use it daily but doesn't matter that the

660
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,410
emails wrong

661
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,210
maybe that's the case because email

662
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,980
revalidation isn't the thing in most

663
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:23,530
accounts these days which is good I

664
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,570
don't like machines annoying me by

665
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,760
sending me random emails so for

666
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:30,550
Montenegro we have a pink dot me here

667
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,410
and drop mail dot me force there be a

668
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:35,010
hotmail dot arrest is actually run by

669
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:36,720
hotmail default mail or something else

670
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:39,100
is it local

671
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,470
no one knows no one is using that but

672
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,899
that's number one interesting

673
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:46,000
then open tell cameras and SBB RS as

674
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:50,020
well and forty Gestapo you have ever met

675
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,790
dot you and PTT dot you now let's

676
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,889
compare the government's we didn't see

677
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,450
any of these governments in in the first

678
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,220
slide so let's compare the government

679
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,240
between themselves so if you feel

680
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,740
throughout all the governmental

681
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,440
addresses from these six countries

682
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,450
Latta once again is number one you would

683
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,510
expect Serbia to be number five but

684
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:10,930
surveys number two so it would indicate

685
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,960
that Serbian government well because of

686
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,510
the nature of

687
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,310
of the leek I wouldn't use the word was

688
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:19,010
attacked was targeted I couldn't is that

689
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:21,889
but was less careful or using the wrong

690
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:25,910
site or or using their email the work

691
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:27,320
email address for private purposes once

692
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:31,610
again we're gonna have six slides which

693
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:33,560
you can take a look at later after after

694
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:37,340
the talk which governmental addresses

695
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:39,560
for Estonia which for Lithuania then for

696
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:43,879
Latvia for Latvia you can see a huge

697
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:45,710
huge huge part is other right so it's

698
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,570
only the tool only includes top ten

699
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:51,250
addresses and there's a bunch of

700
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:53,419
addresses if we look at them so we have

701
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:56,240
Estonia number one I think that's a

702
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:59,960
ministry for information look any

703
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,230
statistics institution Latvia the

704
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:05,480
foreign affairs ministry for Montenegro

705
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:07,220
I just got me I guess that's because

706
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,590
that's how they set up their email lists

707
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,760
mostly I'm not sure then we have this

708
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:15,070
for Serbia what is that

709
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,070
and as the any Serbians here

710
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:22,669
unemployment office okay lots of free

711
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:29,720
time on their hands for Yugoslavia we

712
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:35,480
have a circle that's a you see okay and

713
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:37,040
and yet we happen so looking at that

714
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,960
statistics that way is of course

715
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,840
interesting but what actually brings

716
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,180
home the the message on the validity of

717
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,040
the data and the validity of the

718
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,960
approach of looking at the email

719
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:52,100
addresses of the domains rather than at

720
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:55,790
the IP addresses is the user names so

721
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:58,629
what they think is top one user name for

722
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:01,250
let's say I don't know and Latvia

723
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:06,620
okay let's start easy top one use them

724
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:08,600
for Serbia good you know I've never

725
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:12,889
registered anywhere with my Rhodes email

726
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:15,439
but I still get spam like a bunch no no

727
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:18,310
it's not true so for for all the

728
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,970
countries top one or two email is info

729
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:22,740
but but obviously for

730
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:26,850
for Serbia and Yugoslavia here its

731
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:30,210
office but top two is info anyway and we

732
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:32,520
also start seeing some national names in

733
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,560
in top 3 so we have undress and Martin

734
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,280
for stony kept Thomas and Andrews for

735
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:41,010
Lithuania and yon is for what for Latvia

736
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:45,350
and has been of course for Larry as well

737
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:46,590
and here's here's the rest of the top

738
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:49,830
ten

739
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:51,629
I think it's top 10 so we do see quite

740
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:53,129
quite some national I'm Xia sure you can

741
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,530
even take a photo but the slides will be

742
00:32:53,130 --> 00:33:00,030
available in in one hour as well for

743
00:32:55,530 --> 00:33:02,220
your use and so it makes sense right and

744
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:06,570
what also makes sense is that Serbian

745
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,410
and Yugoslavia names are basically they

746
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,360
match right

747
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:14,850
it also makes makes a lot of sense we

748
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:19,379
see an overlap in there now the next

749
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:23,520
slide will be what yeah top passwords

750
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:27,180
same countries again so number one

751
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:31,310
password is one two three four five six

752
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:34,920
yes that number one password except

753
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:38,690
except for Montenegro and Serbia we'll

754
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:41,340
get we'll get back to that in a minute

755
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,240
if we look at number one password this

756
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,429
is what we get

757
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,200
percentage-wise and this is where this

758
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,640
approach makes more sense than the

759
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,670
previous approach filtering out by

760
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,620
unique unique accounts because

761
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:55,560
previously these percentages were around

762
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:58,080
1% or under 1% now we can actually see

763
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:01,169
the real prevalence of of the bad

764
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:05,250
password and we also see that Latvia is

765
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:07,440
is safe because it's only 1% but on a

766
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:09,090
serious note it's not because I don't

767
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,490
think it's because Latvians are more

768
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:14,570
more intelligent in choosing their

769
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:18,810
passwords I think the thing is that

770
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:20,400
Latvians had much more data leak so many

771
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:24,810
more records were released for Latvians

772
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:26,670
so I guess stupid users get a good leak

773
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:30,080
more often so that's that's the message

774
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:33,030
there number two all right we have some

775
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,810
some some original passwords this 1 Q 2

776
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,599
W 3

777
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:38,379
3

778
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,669
is-is-is quite common these days and at

779
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:42,248
number three we finally see some

780
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:45,190
national passwords appearing so some

781
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:48,069
passwords that include a dictionary ward

782
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:51,039
of that language so here for example in

783
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:55,529
indicate in red is lieutenant word lo

784
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:58,479
opus which which means the animal and

785
00:34:55,529 --> 00:35:02,079
and if you look at the rest of the top

786
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:04,720
we also if you look at the rest of the

787
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,819
top we see some more word from the

788
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,399
dictionary but only in the Baltic States

789
00:35:06,819 --> 00:35:10,930
I mean maybe I don't now know the local

790
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,559
did the Balkan language is that well but

791
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:19,410
it didn't find any any local words in in

792
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:23,349
there so yeah yeah I don't think that's

793
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:26,828
another thing that's a lot of work but

794
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:28,839
but still if you look at at the the

795
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:31,059
column the last column and second to

796
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:33,328
last once again we see quite an overlap

797
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:35,769
which means that people may be using

798
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:38,920
email addresses or were using emails

799
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:41,950
interchangeably or maybe at some point

800
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:45,059
they switched over to the Serbian TLD

801
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:50,218
and and reuse the same old password so

802
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:53,829
now of course we have to ask ourselves

803
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:59,200
what is this right what what are these

804
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:59,650
top ten passwords and well the answer is

805
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:08,828
simple

806
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:11,589
I don't know this this place right here

807
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:14,049
is actually why after presenting last

808
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:18,219
time I decided I have to look at the

809
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:21,430
users uniquely so I don't so I don't see

810
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:24,039
a password in the top if it has been

811
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:26,859
used by a user and the users simply

812
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:27,759
included in the leaks 1000 times I

813
00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:30,999
didn't even see that

814
00:36:27,759 --> 00:36:32,619
so I removed all that and each entry now

815
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:37,328
only appears once when calculating the

816
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:41,289
top and they are still there so I mean

817
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:44,380
maybe it's the data quality but yeah I'm

818
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:47,119
baffled so in QA this this will be a

819
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:49,339
special Q&A you will have the option Li

820
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,249
to not only ask question you can do a

821
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:54,190
comment so you're welcome to comment on

822
00:36:52,249 --> 00:36:59,180
what the hell was that

823
00:36:54,190 --> 00:37:02,660
now let lets let's wait for the key name

824
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:06,169
so one more thing that I was really

825
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:08,899
looking forward to is some other things

826
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:10,549
that we had in the dump I showed you

827
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:14,660
some pictures I showed you some Excel

828
00:37:10,549 --> 00:37:16,940
files stuff like that but my daily job

829
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,170
involves the consulting pen testing and

830
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:23,529
stuff like that including software

831
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:27,170
engineering and I couldn't find any

832
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:29,450
recovery questions leaked before so now

833
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:31,309
I finally found one I mean I found a

834
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:33,710
couple and there were a couple leaks in

835
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:38,599
there in this large lake that had to do

836
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:40,309
with recovery questions so now my my pen

837
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:41,839
testing mind switched on and I thought

838
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:43,999
yeah finally I will be able to

839
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,288
understand how users think how they

840
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:46,879
answer results recovery questions

841
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:48,079
because that's an easy way to get into

842
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,450
your account usually if you have those

843
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:55,130
enabled right so this is from from a

844
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:58,160
side that allowed users to specify their

845
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:00,859
own recovery questions and usually I

846
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,379
would say right it's it's safer that a

847
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:05,598
user can specify their own question if

848
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:08,150
the alternative is that you choose one

849
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,979
question out of ten from a list well

850
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:12,859
looking at these answers and questions

851
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:14,629
here I have to doubt that and and you

852
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:16,819
have to make a decision when making this

853
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:18,499
your system if you have recovered

854
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:19,819
questions do you have them preset or

855
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:21,799
they allow a user to type in whatever

856
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:24,558
they want because this is this is what I

857
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:27,650
sell so for example there was a recovery

858
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:29,119
question who are you and what that user

859
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,529
specified in their account and the

860
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,279
answer is this mess wait for that is

861
00:38:30,529 --> 00:38:37,609
it's me the original writing is on your

862
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:40,789
left and and there was a recovery

863
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:49,450
question nil the answer obviously is

864
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:53,390
yeah that's me yes Who am I

865
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:55,578
camel which is a name in one of the

866
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:58,100
russian-speaking countries and and

867
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:59,960
finally QWERTY

868
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,400
and there are two possible answers that

869
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,320
people would give to this right if you

870
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,870
were a hacker and you were wanted wanted

871
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,750
to get in and the system said please

872
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:12,080
answer the following questions QWERTY

873
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:14,450
right you could type a is D F G H or you

874
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:18,049
could also type QWERTY which is the

875
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:21,290
correct answer here for this one so I'm

876
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:23,690
not sure if if if we assume that users

877
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:25,580
aren't inclined and will never be

878
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,650
inclined to waste their own time and

879
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:30,230
comfort for security I'm not sure that

880
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:32,270
offering them okay you can type more and

881
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,550
have a secure question is a good idea

882
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:36,050
now maybe you have some extra option I

883
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:37,760
want to be secure and then you can type

884
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:44,900
your question because than that you can

885
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:48,940
offer them to choose from a list now in

886
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:51,950
the final slides I want to talk about

887
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:57,560
the obvious things you can do to prevent

888
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:58,759
this stuff don't do password reuse I'm

889
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,259
not gonna ask you to raise your hand

890
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,100
because no one will raise your hand even

891
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:07,100
though almost everyone reuses passwords

892
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:10,759
for example for throwaway accounts but

893
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:13,610
don't reuse passwords obviously use

894
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:17,240
strong passwords one two three four five

895
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:18,980
six is not a good password if you use

896
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,020
strong passwords your friend is a

897
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:23,420
password manager which helps you

898
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,920
remember the strong passwords just

899
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,720
remember the main pilot the master

900
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,540
password okay that's the important part

901
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:34,490
there and finally if you have any

902
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:37,070
developers in the room you should use

903
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:40,759
salting you should salt your damn

904
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:44,000
passwords because the leak here came in

905
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,400
different different formats we had email

906
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,990
addresses some user names not all were

907
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,880
email addresses but we have email

908
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:52,459
addresses and then we had a password or

909
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,350
a hashed password and a password this

910
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:57,560
hash is out salting it makes it super

911
00:40:54,350 --> 00:41:00,200
easy for a person with lots of money to

912
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:04,100
just crack all the passwords or all the

913
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,649
terabytes of data quite quickly now I'm

914
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:08,509
gonna talk for two minutes about what

915
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:10,769
salting is because

916
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:12,809
smart people are simply experienced

917
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:14,609
people or overconfident people like me

918
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:16,589
just come and say do that do that do

919
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:17,940
that and go away right and don't explain

920
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:20,009
what they mean by that so I thought okay

921
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,259
I'll explain what salting is for those

922
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:24,960
of you who are not sure what that is

923
00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:28,259
exactly or have never heard that so we

924
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,480
have a user for your newlymet's system a

925
00:41:28,259 --> 00:41:33,930
user chooses their secure password which

926
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,549
is one two three four five six and you

927
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:36,930
being a good developer of course you do

928
00:41:35,549 --> 00:41:40,980
not store this password in the database

929
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:43,499
you cache it first you do not store it

930
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:45,299
plain text that's the first step

931
00:41:43,499 --> 00:41:47,689
you also don't encrypt it with a two-way

932
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:53,970
encryption function that is second step

933
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:58,319
shares Microtech yeah now they fix that

934
00:41:53,970 --> 00:42:00,480
they fix that capable months ago

935
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,970
so you cache it right you create a cache

936
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,980
here's a super simple Lane short cache

937
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:08,569
doesn't matter for just for an example

938
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:11,400
right now a different user comes by and

939
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:13,499
creates an account and thinks I need to

940
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,329
select a secure password what about one

941
00:42:13,499 --> 00:42:17,339
two three four five six and then you

942
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:19,380
catch that password and even the

943
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:21,288
password is cached in the database it's

944
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:23,940
the same cache so it means the attacker

945
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:25,859
instead of spending twice as much

946
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,900
resources just cracks one of the caches

947
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:30,900
because they are both identical they're

948
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:33,119
both the same caching is good compared

949
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,299
to not caching but salting is better so

950
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:40,799
how do we solve same users they come to

951
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:43,259
the system they select randomly look at

952
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:45,059
the top passwords which the password

953
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:49,049
revenues today are number one so okay

954
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:52,079
and select the password what your system

955
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:54,690
does at that time you generate well-salt

956
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,579
can be called a random random system

957
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:58,650
generated password additional password

958
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:00,089
I wouldn't call second factor not that's

959
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:02,190
complete not that but your system

960
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:05,549
generates a random additional password

961
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:07,529
and once again important note it has to

962
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:10,739
be generated when the user enters their

963
00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:12,690
new password you cannot have it just for

964
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:15,480
the system you can't you cannot have one

965
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:17,190
salt for the whole system in my job as a

966
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,490
pen tester I've seen systems like that

967
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:23,070
it's just a bit better than not salting

968
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:25,560
South has been it because now before we

969
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,930
hash it your system can combine the red

970
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,880
and the blue into one string and then

971
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:32,310
hashing it will result in completely

972
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,910
different cash and then of course the

973
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:37,560
question is how do you verify that the

974
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:39,060
password one two three four five six is

975
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,450
legit when the user comes back in year

976
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,220
later

977
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,750
and types in their secure password code

978
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,160
do you see if you switch it because

979
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:47,160
cache is completely different right you

980
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,750
can't you can't cash it again well you

981
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,410
store this in the database you stored

982
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:54,030
together with the salt and even though

983
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:56,670
everything is in the database and it

984
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:58,619
takes almost the same processing time to

985
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,810
verify the password for an attacker it

986
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:03,450
means that each user has to be tracked

987
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:05,009
separately and that means that even in

988
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:07,799
secure password like one two three four

989
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:10,230
five six might not get cracked if you

990
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:16,140
use a good hashing algorithm and if

991
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:22,170
there are lots and lots of users so this

992
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:25,290
is the top password and overall we've

993
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:29,040
seen it in 0.16 percent of the 23

994
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:32,849
billion entries the question is with the

995
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,500
database being old apparently because of

996
00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:35,970
all that till these we saw because of

997
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,960
the names we saw because of the

998
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:43,500
passwords we saw database being gold

999
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:49,280
what do you think about the top password

1000
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:49,280
this year the password January 2019 yeah

1001
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:55,710
good what does River five six seven

1002
00:44:52,950 --> 00:45:00,950
eight yeah that's a good guess the top

1003
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:04,020
password for January 2019 could be

1004
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:06,390
determined because this lifetime

1005
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:09,210
subscription to the password database in

1006
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:12,480
the cloud included free weekly updates

1007
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:14,339
and up to the leak updates were

1008
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,960
happening so you could download the

1009
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:18,690
folder with passwords that were gathered

1010
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,810
just this week so I looked at the folder

1011
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:23,640
of generators in nineteen and the top

1012
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:26,490
one password for genuine person nineteen

1013
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:31,589
is one two three four five six

1014
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:33,740
with 0.32 percent of the entries thank

1015
00:45:31,589 --> 00:45:33,740
you

1016
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:45,259
now if there are any questions I or

1017
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:47,150
comments I asked you to wait for the

1018
00:45:45,260 --> 00:46:29,589
microphone before you speak and the

1019
00:45:47,150 --> 00:46:38,589
presentation will be available on 20/20

1020
00:46:29,589 --> 00:46:41,029
one place and you will work thank you

1021
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:45,109
thank you for the question

1022
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:49,460
so there are 858 passwords that include

1023
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:53,450
zero 2009 in dot RS so less than

1024
00:46:49,460 --> 00:47:00,980
thousand which is let's see which is so

1025
00:46:53,450 --> 00:47:06,460
we had we had 20/20 800 sorry 280,000

1026
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:06,460
and about 1000 of those include 0 21

1027
00:47:11,979 --> 00:47:14,979
Oh

1028
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:37,009
just dearly haha without deal and yet if

1029
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:39,470
I may ask you a question

1030
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:52,310
since says the bottom like is a disc how

1031
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:54,020
does that help yeah of course of course

1032
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:55,190
you want to have a sissy but I couldn't

1033
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:57,259
afford to Porter but this is these

1034
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:59,060
that's what I did is on a yeah on the

1035
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:00,440
hard drive any more comments or

1036
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,799
questions maybe about those passwords

1037
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,800
yeah

1038
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,920
they forced us to

1039
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:31,100
Oh

1040
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,100
but the new of course I knew

1041
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:52,860
that's that's nothing question should

1042
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:56,490
government's regulate technically how

1043
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:58,920
secure the systems be it's an

1044
00:48:56,490 --> 00:49:01,680
interesting question because I'm I'm the

1045
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:03,660
author of of the Latvian national

1046
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,819
legislation that that regulates

1047
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:08,040
technical minimum security measures but

1048
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:11,040
it only applies to to governmental

1049
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:13,140
systems and it makes sense in a way if

1050
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:16,050
we talk about salting or not salting I

1051
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:18,930
mean baby steps right one of the points

1052
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:23,220
I wrote in in Latin legislation is that

1053
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:26,910
a system must have a password that's it

1054
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:29,430
so baby steps I mean caching caching is

1055
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:31,410
already better than not catching so

1056
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:33,180
maybe maybe in ten years we can talk

1057
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:35,368
about something I mean I'd love to have

1058
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:37,379
it immediately but it all it all has

1059
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:40,590
costs and I wasn't sure from from your

1060
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:42,420
question if if this includes all the

1061
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:43,680
systems if government says all the

1062
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,280
commercial systems or even private

1063
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:49,680
citizens must use caching that's a

1064
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:53,100
strange thing for for a European if

1065
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:55,799
that's the case but in anyway salting is

1066
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:58,319
of course is of course battery and but

1067
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,850
for example Latvia and the Latin

1068
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:04,130
legislation doesn't have that as well it

1069
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:06,270
just says it has to be scrambled and

1070
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:08,070
while we look for the next question

1071
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:10,140
getting back to the previous question

1072
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:15,710
there are no dots

1073
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:15,710
Givi addresses for those six countries

1074
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:31,140
and I presume the other part is a

1075
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:35,780
birthday so could be that's where they

1076
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:35,779
ascended 30 or something because I

1077
00:50:56,150 --> 00:51:04,340
thought gee this is using

1078
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:41,209
so this originates I see yeah yeah thank

1079
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:44,180
you thank you thank you for the comment

1080
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:45,440
Oh Jo yes sometimes I use that none of

1081
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:47,359
none of the six countries that does

1082
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,300
through somebody's do use that I did

1083
00:51:47,359 --> 00:52:01,720
find a user named evil guys go fishing

1084
00:51:50,300 --> 00:52:01,720
at something sorry

1085
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:12,700
Oh for my own hmm

1086
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:17,509
[Laughter]

1087
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:18,919
no no I haven't I haven't but I don't

1088
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:21,740
have I don't have the data here because

1089
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:24,830
I don't I I don't have the research hard

1090
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:26,479
drive is me for comm I've used my

1091
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:29,240
dot-com domain for for basically my

1092
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:32,720
whole life so yeah I could look at I

1093
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:34,339
could look at that but I regularly well

1094
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:38,419
not regularly but like once a year I go

1095
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:40,070
to Troy hunts website and and take a

1096
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:42,800
look at some my email addresses it's

1097
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:44,630
never there because for all the shitty

1098
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,360
websites I usually use some throwaway

1099
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:50,510
email or mail matter or you know I don't

1100
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:54,080
even try to make an account but yeah I

1101
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:55,790
mean we so getting back to the start of

1102
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,830
the talk we can never be hundred percent

1103
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:59,840
sure that it's not gonna be there I

1104
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:01,610
can't I can't say that there's anything

1105
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,290
I can do to make sure that my email

1106
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:06,350
address will will not appear there like

1107
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:08,210
in a year or two or ten because it's out

1108
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:10,660
of autumn our hands it's the security of

1109
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,660
the systems

1110
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:19,160
education

1111
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,160
you

1112
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:29,000
that is one of the solutions passwords

1113
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:30,019
that there are there are companies and

1114
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,960
there are individuals and

1115
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:34,519
non-governmental organizations that

1116
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,230
their mission is killing passwords

1117
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:39,589
passwords are bad let's kill passwords

1118
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:41,630
I don't mind passwords I think I think I

1119
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:44,930
think it's ok right because if a system

1120
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:46,670
gets hacked right the the data is

1121
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:48,230
usually available anyway so the problem

1122
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:50,319
is password reuse if you don't help us

1123
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:52,730
for the reuse the system being cracked

1124
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:54,200
the data is there you can access it with

1125
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:56,089
with a result identification doesn't

1126
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,910
matter so I think password reuse is a

1127
00:53:56,089 --> 00:54:02,029
problem educating users I think I think

1128
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:04,730
is is possible to some extent for users

1129
00:54:02,029 --> 00:54:06,799
that are uneducated will to fight

1130
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:09,109
certification isn't gonna make things

1131
00:54:06,799 --> 00:54:11,509
better because they kind of too afraid

1132
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:13,670
that I like my governmental ID that I

1133
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:16,220
put in my laptop a users aren't gonna

1134
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:21,700
set up first time I set it up ten years

1135
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:25,308
ago it took me four days to set it up

1136
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:27,250
last time it took it took much much it

1137
00:54:25,309 --> 00:54:29,569
was much faster it was four hours right

1138
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:31,400
actually the time before that it was one

1139
00:54:29,569 --> 00:54:32,720
hour but then they changed stuff and it

1140
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,240
stopped working on Linux so it was four

1141
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,160
hours again so users want simple stuff

1142
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,839
like for example when you talk about to

1143
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,940
a Fae for you to users they will say

1144
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:43,369
awesome s that works right but it's a

1145
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:46,279
mess is damn broken and I know I've been

1146
00:54:43,369 --> 00:54:48,200
getting I've been getting crap on

1147
00:54:46,279 --> 00:54:49,730

1148
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:52,129

1151
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:57,919

1152
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,109

1153
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:04,099

two-factor just becomes a loop called
