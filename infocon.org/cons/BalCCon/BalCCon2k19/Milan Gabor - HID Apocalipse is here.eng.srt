1
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,430
since it's the time thank you for for

2
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,680
coming to my talk

3
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,860
my name is Melinda Barry and I will be

4
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,940
speaking about the human interface

5
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:46,290
device apocalypse or subtitle when the

6
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:49,920
click clicker strike again so for those

7
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,780
who doesn't know who I am I'm actually a

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,690
pen tester presenter ethical hacker

9
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,269
trainer I do a lot of trainings and one

10
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:01,070
of the b-sides Lew Ljubljana organizers

11
00:00:57,269 --> 00:01:03,780
so if you're next March somewhere around

12
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:09,420
Ljubljana you're more than welcome and

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,950
I'm really really big Balcom fan what

14
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,810
does this mean this means that every

15
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:20,040
year I bring more and more Slovenian

16
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:23,460
guys to know it's not so thank you okay

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,710
so what are we gonna be talking about

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,048
today so first of all we're just gonna

19
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,288
go and try to look what's actually hit

20
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,030
device then we will go just through

21
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:35,100
history development of different kind of

22
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,320
tools why you're gonna see and

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,770
understand a little bit later then we're

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,250
gonna see different kind of scenarios

25
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:47,880
we're gonna look just briefly through

26
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,549
some of the CVS quite hot from this

27
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:55,079
summer we're gonna be talking about log

28
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:59,060
II something I also prepared five live

29
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,529
demos so it's gonna be heavy demos and

30
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:05,490
yesterday I didn't have time to pray to

31
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,920
to get demo gods so I hope since there

32
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,819
is also hardware and stuff included that

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,590
the demos will be working and at the end

34
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,390
you're going to see that with hit

35
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,270
devices you can get really really

36
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:24,690
strange crazy ideas how to use that kind

37
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:27,660
of devices okay if we ask Google so

38
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,700
what's actually hit device it will get

39
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,239
you this kind of answer so it's kind of

40
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,879
human interface device which is used by

41
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,480
humans take input from humans and give

42
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,379
out

43
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,260
back to humans and you can see through

44
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:46,560
the presentations that sometimes you

45
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,780
know you can inject in these let's say

46
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,629
outputs or inputs it depends from which

47
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:56,160
site which site your which sites you are

48
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:59,429
looking to okay probably in the room

49
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,760
there is no guy that never use one hit

50
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:10,769
device right so we all use who's using

51
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:13,620
the wireless keyboards okay we are the

52
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:15,750
hackers conference so less people than

53
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,200
in normal adult who's using wireless

54
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,730
mouse is not bluetooth okay majority

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:28,099
gain control is any gamers here

56
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:30,929
cool clickers saw any presenters yeah

57
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:35,670
boy and there's here is really already

58
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:37,890
smiling any accountants because we have

59
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,660
also alphanumerical devices right so

60
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,450
accountants they use it you know with

61
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:46,319
with Wi-Fi we have the medical devices

62
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,540
and actually there is definition that

63
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:53,730
any device that meets USB HID

64
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:56,970
specification it's allowed to be to be

65
00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:03,328
used what do you think about this device

66
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:06,510
is this also some kind of hit device can

67
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:10,950
it be yeah what's normally how does this

68
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:13,380
behave as a keyboard right so you can

69
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,869
get also into this one probably this one

70
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,409
is not very good why this picture is not

71
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,410
appropriate

72
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:27,270
yeah it's white it's white okay you're

73
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,210
still still awake that was the test okay

74
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:35,280
but if we go back to the future and I

75
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:38,609
mean this let's say three years back we

76
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,119
see that we have plenty of different

77
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,430
kind of devices probably you're asking

78
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,270
why you're going to show us some all

79
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:50,330
devices well during the different kind

80
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,580
of presentation and also the trainings I

81
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:56,159
would say I discovered that some of the

82
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,780
people or some of the attendees are some

83
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,750
of the even trainees they are not kind

84
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:04,140
of a word that we have plenty of devices

85
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:07,380
you know sometimes we really miss some

86
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,300
basics some basic tools that can help in

87
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:16,260
this in this area that we are talking

88
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:21,660
about today who does have this kind of

89
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:24,390
device rubber ducky cool so it's

90
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:29,370
actually quite old one right it's around

91
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:31,380
from 2011 it doesn't have any external

92
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:35,730
communication so you have to plug it

93
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,860
well it does have will it does have the

94
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,740
SD card so you can use different kind of

95
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,440
payloads but normally it's used like

96
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,500
also lunch so you just throw them away

97
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,560
or try to I don't know persuade someone

98
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,230
that puts this USB stick into his

99
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,730
computer and the exfiltration is done

100
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,070
through the payload so you have to do

101
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:58,740
something and you might get caught doing

102
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:01,830
this and of course there's also a price

103
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,050
tag so it's about forty nine fifty

104
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,530
dollars and at the moment if you try to

105
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,690
buy it it sold out so you cannot get it

106
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:12,299
at this moment so you have to wait until

107
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:16,469
the heck five creates a new batch of the

108
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:21,240
rubber duckies okay anybody owning car

109
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:22,949
USB ninja one

110
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,080
okay

111
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:29,889
actually it's interface does it have its

112
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,740
USB and bluetooth low low energy so

113
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:35,350
payload can be used as Arduino so you

114
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,419
have to know a little bit Arduino or you

115
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:41,169
can just Google and get some kind of

116
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:43,000
payloads that that Arduino compatible it

117
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:45,549
can be used as auto so just plug it in

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,350
and it triggers or you can trigger it

119
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:52,540
over the Bluetooth the only reason is or

120
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:58,810
that's about one hundred and eighty

121
00:06:52,540 --> 00:07:00,700
dollars for a complete kit have you used

122
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:06,700
it over the some kind of engagement or

123
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:11,710
just for fun just for fun okay the next

124
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:14,200
one that we have it's alternative to

125
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:16,180
rubber ducky it's really cheap

126
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,300
alternative why because it only costs

127
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,970
like $3 so it's kind of similar

128
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,650
functionality there's no SD card so if

129
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:27,160
you have want to have different payloads

130
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:29,109
for UNIX for Linux or for Mac or for

131
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,370
Windows you have to have different kind

132
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:36,060
of devices and also you need to know a

133
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,860
little bit about Adreno programming and

134
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,870
if you take a look at this device there

135
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,270
is also a design factor because if

136
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:48,880
they're quite narrow so if you try to

137
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:51,520
put put put this ticket spark into into

138
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,560
the box like this so the normal USB key

139
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,229
you would have a you must have a little

140
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,450
bit problem but it's really nice and

141
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:00,490
cheap alternative and it's really easy

142
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:04,060
to programming so who is doing they're

143
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:05,889
doing no programming okay cool so

144
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,910
probably this is not a problem to write

145
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:13,389
let's say 15 lines of code see that

146
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:16,900
PowerShell is still quite used in this

147
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:19,510
this kind of area and you have really

148
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,359
nice device that can I don't know steal

149
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:28,210
the DS T is still the data exfiltrated

150
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:30,440
or something else okay let's get to

151
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:33,409
another very interesting

152
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,049
very interesting device this was

153
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:40,549
presented by luca bon journée in 2018 so

154
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:44,420
last year so and if you want to see this

155
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:48,680
is kind of one device why is this really

156
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:50,270
really good one because it's combined so

157
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:55,520
you have the USB and you have divided

158
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:59,569
file so it's kind of he married the

159
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:02,180
arduino platform with the esp8266 chip

160
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,490
which provides the Wi-Fi Wi-Fi

161
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:07,520
connectivity why is this so important

162
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,740
well because I can plug the the USB

163
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,470
stick in some somebody's computer and

164
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,240
can control it over the Wi-Fi so I can

165
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,630
send the keystrokes I can send the

166
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,940
commands and you can exit rate it this

167
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:24,860
data the this data over the Wi-Fi or

168
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:27,560
even over the serial port which is

169
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,040
really nice so what you have to do you

170
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:34,040
just plug it in wait a couple of seconds

171
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,620
plug it out and all the data that you

172
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:40,010
want to steal are already on this USB

173
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:42,830
device it's really nice built built form

174
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:47,450
so it fits you know in these nice

175
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:53,030
Chinese plastic case so it looks like

176
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:55,400
really really good USB USB stick it even

177
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:59,860
has a light so you know when it was

178
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:04,370
successful or if it was not successful

179
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:06,650
so Luca as you gonna see in a future

180
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:09,170
slide he also building the next

181
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:12,290
generation at the moment there is a kind

182
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:17,089
of beta phase which is going to be

183
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:19,449
called we hit elite version so he was

184
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:22,820
doing a little bit about evolution and

185
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:24,950
think about it it's since we have the

186
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,790
firewalls next generation think about

187
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,830
this as a wicked next generation so it's

188
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:34,069
really close to release but it's a

189
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:35,960
little bit larger in size so you see

190
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,960
this box is quite big you know if you

191
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,610
come to some potential target and you

192
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,589
plug it in then you would probably have

193
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,260
a problem why because it's quite it's

194
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:47,120
quite wide quite

195
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:51,650
why is this because it does it does have

196
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,620
the GSM modem on it so you can control

197
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:58,189
it over the over the seller or network

198
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,930
so you don't have to with this so you

199
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,760
don't have to be so close because with

200
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:05,689
this you have to be in the range of the

201
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:09,620
Wi-Fi network coverage and we all know

202
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:13,640
that these small chips they they have

203
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:16,279
not very very long range but with this

204
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:20,810
you just some you just plug it in the

205
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:24,260
device calls back over the 3G and you

206
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:28,010
have actually covered channel how to

207
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:32,569
let's say attack or steal the steal the

208
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:36,110
data so he has been running kind of one

209
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:39,830
game so if you sometimes you know he

210
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:42,620
gets really active on Twitter and if

211
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,800
your answer some some of his questions

212
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:50,390
right you might get one of the

213
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:52,490
pre-production pre-production devices so

214
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,439
with all these devices that we are using

215
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,089
at the moment you know there are

216
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,660
different kind of attack scenarios but

217
00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:02,720
mainly they're quite same so USB sticks

218
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,860
dropping you know in front of the in

219
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,580
front of the customers

220
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:10,040
in front of the companies and normally

221
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,680
still there is a classical payload with

222
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:16,579
PowerShell one-liner or something else

223
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,500
or you can also use the scripts to

224
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,839
download and execute malicious files

225
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,240
using the search et alors bits admin or

226
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,330
something else so this is one of the

227
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,150
scenarios I already mentioned the other

228
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,970
one so the wicked one can also use the

229
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:36,079
serial port so he can also exit rate the

230
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:38,870
data so simple really simple PowerShell

231
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,940
scripts can read all kind of files so if

232
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:44,120
you know that on targets computer there

233
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,890
is a one file adapter that pad you can

234
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,000
actually read it you can list all

235
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:53,209
comport most important thing what do you

236
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,200
think if you manage to grab with this

237
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:57,768
USB stick somebody Wi-Fi password from

238
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,139
his know

239
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:04,220
book the thing this is quite good

240
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:09,589
opportunity is this kind of good

241
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:11,749
scenario what do you think yes or no so

242
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:15,350
if you plug in this stick into

243
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:20,239
somebody's notebook and get away with

244
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:23,689
his Wi-Fi passwords what do you think

245
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:26,569
buoyant is this kind of it's okay

246
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:28,399
probably if I try to put it in computer

247
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:32,410
I could probably get away with some

248
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,569
interesting Wi-Fi passwords right yep

249
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:39,379
the only drawback with this one it's you

250
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:41,779
need to be close so if I stick this into

251
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:44,989
his computer I need to be close so I can

252
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:47,889
connect over the Wi-Fi Wi-Fi limit and

253
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:52,040
this the way it elite is going to be

254
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:58,129
fixing that let's say drawback from this

255
00:13:52,040 --> 00:14:01,309
one but then again if we try to look hit

256
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:03,589
devices there has been two three years

257
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:08,689
ago there have been one story you know

258
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:13,790
new kid in town was and as all let's say

259
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:18,610
big big failures they get different kind

260
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,610
of names so who knows what mall jacket

261
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:30,150
never heard of magic Boyan no it's okay

262
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:34,199
he okay it's actually quite old one

263
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:38,069
you know it's dated to 2016 from

264
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:41,480
Bastille research and the problem was

265
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:45,000
that these all devices that we are using

266
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:48,390
for example also Logitech Lenovo

267
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,320
Microsoft Mouse's they didn't use any

268
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:56,340
kind of encryption so the channel or 2.4

269
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,530
2.4 gigahertz so the normal Wi-Fi it

270
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:03,800
wasn't equipped at at all so when you

271
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:06,959
put your Y Wi-Fi our keyboard or mouse

272
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,819
the communication between the dongle and

273
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,670
the keyboard or the mouse was not

274
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,520
encrypted so you can eavesdrop on it and

275
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:19,319
you can sniff it or even inject yourself

276
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:22,100
into that channel that was going on it's

277
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,280
really funny story when I show this in

278
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:30,890
let's say very interesting Slovenian

279
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:35,040
government office you know what was the

280
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:37,520
reaction when I showed them demo they

281
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,880
removed all Wi-Fi masts Mouse's and

282
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:45,569
keyboards from different ministries why

283
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,700
because you could inject yourself in we

284
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:51,020
will be showing how your mouse can even

285
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:54,480
even mark how your mouse even can type

286
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:56,430
the only drawback at that time was that

287
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,540
only one device was support supported

288
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:03,329
that was crazy radio and you have to

289
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:09,030
patch it with some custom firmware from

290
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:12,390
Bastille Research there was also a one

291
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:16,500
tool it's a magic jacket that actually

292
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:18,390
could go and it was used by different

293
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,130
kind of people were they were they

294
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:24,140
develop it probably because you know

295
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:28,949
semi canker or air is good speed and

296
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:31,619
still plenty of devices

297
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:33,689
a stillborn burnable to this issue why

298
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:37,019
this was a problem because you have to

299
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:39,569
update each and every dongle of the

300
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:41,549
unifying device from Logitech or from

301
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:45,169
Microsoft or some other other vendors

302
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:51,899
that have been using it so who did

303
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:54,449
updated his unified dongle lately okay

304
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:57,419
three but you're going to see that with

305
00:16:54,449 --> 00:17:00,389
latest latest research from one guy that

306
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:04,679
was actually let's say responsible that

307
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:06,929
also I'm giving this talk here majority

308
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,899
of the people they are not they are not

309
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:12,949
you're not updating from this research

310
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:21,059
from 2016 we see that microsoft

311
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:23,610
microsoft sexy sexy red Mouse's you know

312
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:25,439
this is still were noble why i haven't

313
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:27,388
patched it because I'm using it to demo

314
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,220
it because some of the people they don't

315
00:17:27,388 --> 00:17:31,379
believe that you can actually inject

316
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,149
yourself into the mouse communication

317
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:37,220
and send the keystrokes because they

318
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:40,500
think you know this this cannot type

319
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:43,440
that's you know that's know of all the

320
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,120
mouse you don't have the you don't have

321
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,850
keys you know you have done you don't

322
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,518
have a but still they can send because

323
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:56,039
it's kind of device and you can send the

324
00:17:50,519 --> 00:18:00,480
sender sender keystrokes to them okay

325
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:06,000
that was in 2016 so we still have a lot

326
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:10,230
of vulnerable devices but how is this

327
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,570
related to the current time well I don't

328
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,899
know but how was the weather here in

329
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:18,600
Novi Sad it was hot

330
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:24,689
yes so it was also hot summer really

331
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:28,199
regarding the hit devices why the

332
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:30,090
somebody without googling googling so

333
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,080
without using the Google tell me what

334
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,080
are dcve

335
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:47,260
probably not but these were actually

336
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:51,399
quite hot this summer but let me ask

337
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:53,850
differently who's using Logitech

338
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,850
products

339
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:04,370
who's not using Logitech products any

340
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,370
good reason your

341
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:10,830
corporate policy okay good reason huh

342
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:13,559
I want to ask you where you're working

343
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,870
because you know Alec a couple of

344
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:18,450
companies have different let's say

345
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,070
policies don't use logitech but the

346
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,830
biggest problem is kind of this one's

347
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:27,899
probably you have seen it everywhere in

348
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:29,879
notebooks you know even on computers so

349
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,309
the problem is that and good

350
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,620
communication and vulnerabilities that

351
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:38,160
have been found during the during the

352
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:40,549
research from one guy that we're gonna

353
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:46,190
meet a little bit a little bit later so

354
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:51,418
if we put what actually these CVS means

355
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:53,370
any crypto guys in the audience okay

356
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:57,000
crypto guys what does this mean if

357
00:19:53,370 --> 00:20:00,239
you're sniff a s key when you you do the

358
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,590
pairing so when this mouse is pairing

359
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,690
with the dongle

360
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:07,790
if you sniff the AES keys that are used

361
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,790
for encrypting the communication

362
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,389
they're doing on the roadway

363
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:30,400
ESP is my transfer money upon

364
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:30,399
okay yes that's that is one of it sorry

365
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:35,990
he said that the a s keys are let's say

366
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,149
transfert or exchange it in some

367
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,310
insecure way so you can get the get it

368
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,200
so that was it

369
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,690
that was his comment which is quite

370
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,970
right so the next CV was you can

371
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,960
actually injection with key dumped from

372
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:55,310
the USB from presentation clickers I was

373
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:58,640
really happy to see yesterday when Chris

374
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:59,149
was doing her presentation he didn't use

375
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,320
clicker

376
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:05,540
I guess she said she had really good

377
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:09,230
reason to do that or she might didn't

378
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:11,149
have it with with her so but yes you can

379
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:20,270
actually use this kind of clickers you

380
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:21,830
know so can this type yes or no well if

381
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,490
you're seeing there are only four

382
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,530
buttons here

383
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,930
normal clicker where some of the

384
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:29,389
clickers they only have two for it and

385
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:32,230
backwards but here you're actually

386
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:35,300
they're sending some kind of keystrokes

387
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:39,620
but they are limited now they are

388
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:43,490
limited they cannot say sent ASCII 6565

389
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:46,010
see I think still they cannot send it

390
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,720
because they have kind of they're

391
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:50,750
blocking but we're gonna see that

392
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,750
there's kind of trick but most of you

393
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:57,380
forgot it already we have been using a

394
00:21:53,750 --> 00:22:01,790
lot let's say ten years ago but now you

395
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:04,400
know we don't use it anymore okay we can

396
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:12,649
also dump the keys so if somebody gets

397
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:14,600
to to the unifying dongle so if your

398
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:18,650
keyboard is connected to the unifying

399
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,449
dongle do you have 100% time so you're

400
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,430
looking at it hundred percent time so

401
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:26,270
nobody gets physical access to this

402
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:29,360
dongle or you don't care because it's

403
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:31,610
put somewhere in behind or in in your

404
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,790
laptop so who is taking care for these

405
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:36,810
dongles

406
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:40,290
I want to why because if you manage to

407
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:42,030
get access to this dongle one tool we're

408
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,639
gonna demonstrate you can see that you

409
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,649
can dump the keys so you can snip the

410
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,450
keys you can dump the keys and when you

411
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,460
have it you can actually inject yourself

412
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,870
or you can listen so you can eavesdrop

413
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,580
on the communication who is doing

414
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:58,020
something there's another CBE which is

415
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:02,040
actually injection without key knowledge

416
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:04,230
for receivers patched so receivers which

417
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,850
were already patch against the key

418
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,850
jacking so it's not possible to do the

419
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:13,770
key jacking but still you can do

420
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:17,730
injection okay this what I'm gonna be

421
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:19,800
presenting it's not our work you know

422
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:25,770
you're really standing on the shoulders

423
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:28,500
of great guys on the Giants and you're

424
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:30,090
gonna see now that but anyway we did a

425
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,490
little bit piece so we actually

426
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:35,010
contribute a little bit piece and you

427
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:39,900
can see that in some cases it might be

428
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:42,590
very interesting the another thing so if

429
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:45,710
you miss it there's ona on the internet

430
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:48,120
really good presentation from confidence

431
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:52,530
new tales of wireless input devices

432
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:56,129
which was done on June of 4th so you

433
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:58,680
know this year so just before the really

434
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:00,630
hot summer and these two guys they were

435
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,760
doing separately to discover that Marcos

436
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:07,490
men's was doing it and why is this

437
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:10,020
interesting because anyone from Austria

438
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:13,860
and a lot of Austrian guys are running

439
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:16,410
here you know and if you did miss it

440
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,979
they're going to be speaking of speaking

441
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:23,220
at the deep site conference in Vienna

442
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:26,460
this autumn and this is the announcement

443
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:28,800
was done yesterday so they're gonna be

444
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:31,200
talking about also the vulnerabilities

445
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,500
that they discovered through through

446
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,140
hacking the through hacking the hit

447
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:39,180
devices but we won't be talking about

448
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,960
these guys we will be actually talking

449
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,910
about the tool that wrote Marcus Manx

450
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,179
who is actually author of logic attacker

451
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:48,399
how he

452
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:53,879
called this kind of tools so you can

453
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:58,799
find it here under handle of mama 82 and

454
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:58,799
he's actually author of the pound pie

455
00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:06,070
anybody using pound pie because it can

456
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:08,649
also it can also you're trying to build

457
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:11,110
it well if you're trying to build it you

458
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:12,879
can you have it as a Cali distribution

459
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,590
so you just unzip it and you have

460
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:17,830
everything running so you don't have to

461
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:20,019
villages I just have to customize it but

462
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:24,399
definitely he's been using a lot so he

463
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:26,409
also in his pond pie you can use it as a

464
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:29,350
hid device so it has multiple

465
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:31,389
personalities he's really great

466
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:34,149
researcher we have been working with him

467
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:38,619
for this summer I'm great person with

468
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:40,658
really crazy ideas this talk this his

469
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:44,289
research he actually applied also for

470
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:48,490
the black hat but he was rejected this

471
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:57,509
year but I bet it would be awesome if he

472
00:25:48,490 --> 00:26:02,019
would manage to get together why we also

473
00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:04,899
send this let's say call proposal to the

474
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:08,289
Balkan because it was really interesting

475
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:10,239
what he tries to achieve to get the

476
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:12,820
brought attention security security

477
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,860
community and make customers aware about

478
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,299
these issues because a lot of you know

479
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:21,969
when we are talking about the miles

480
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:24,639
Mouse's and Logitech keyboards we are

481
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:29,769
talking about the huge potential attack

482
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:34,090
surface okay so we're gonna be talking

483
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:37,119
about the log attacker there with Mouse

484
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:40,480
Jack we had a problem why because we had

485
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:43,928
we had a dongle so this is the crazy

486
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:49,330
radio hardware that can actually inject

487
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:50,799
into when if you're using the jacket but

488
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:53,619
the problem was this was only the hard

489
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:56,950
work you need to have software so his

490
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:59,980
idea was can we leverage or can we use

491
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:02,380
some kind of hardware which does have

492
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:05,559
system-on-chip so we don't have to have

493
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:10,330
software separately somewhere so he

494
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:16,090
managed to find the hardware and this

495
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:18,129
tool that's actually kind of here so

496
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:19,600
this is the Nordic he managed to put

497
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:22,390
this software and the hardware on the

498
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,459
same board so you can you don't have to

499
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:28,330
run it anything on your computer so you

500
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:34,270
just plug it in so it's only needs the

501
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:36,399
USB USB plug not nothing else so it's

502
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:39,129
running on dedicated hardware but we've

503
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,929
seen that not only one company makes it

504
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:44,260
but we see that we also have

505
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:49,510
alternatives to that so if we got if you

506
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:51,549
go through his throw his github there is

507
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:53,650
a lot of features that this devices can

508
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:55,870
do and it's really under heavy

509
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:57,700
development so every almost every week

510
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:00,250
or 10 days there's a new version of it

511
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,860
so just flash you just flash the device

512
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,410
and you get the new you get the new

513
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:07,740
version at the moment there are

514
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:11,080
different kind of positive support

515
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:13,720
supported this one it's Nordic and their

516
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:16,178
fee five to eight four zero dongle which

517
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,970
costs around thirty dollars so it's

518
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:20,380
still cheaper then rubber ducky and it

519
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:23,350
you can do the same thing as the rubber

520
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,970
ducky so they are also maker diary two

521
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:28,120
different angles and one is a little bit

522
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:31,780
bigger because it has a possibility to

523
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,120
use it with an external antenna and the

524
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:36,570
cheapest one

525
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:39,189
it's I have it here it's April dongle

526
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,350
which has antenna because this one

527
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:44,770
doesn't have antennae and antenna means

528
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:48,610
that you can be far far far away with

529
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:50,860
wit antenna so these are the dongles so

530
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:54,010
you can use I will be playing with this

531
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:56,860
one this is the cheapest one this one is

532
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:59,620
let's say most stable one because

533
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:03,668
probably they did somebody from China

534
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:05,580
did some very good copying the device

535
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:11,110
and all the features and these are the

536
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:13,310
maker diary dongles ok when you plug in

537
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:16,399
this device it actually has

538
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:18,919
for kind of personalities so we can

539
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,710
behave like serial pulled pork so you

540
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:24,080
have just connected with your console or

541
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:27,560
your pootie or something else or even

542
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,939
with the screen it can it can behave

543
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,310
like a mouse it can behave like a

544
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,590
keyboard and there is also one

545
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:36,409
possibility there is a kind of roll so

546
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:39,500
everything that's getting you can filter

547
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:43,820
or you can react or you can do your own

548
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:47,300
processing in this device so a lot of

549
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:49,480
attacker these this devices or just

550
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,110
firmware that you actually install it on

551
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,800
flashing on your device

552
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:56,469
it covers these Logitech vulnerabilities

553
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:00,560
so different kind of and we're gonna see

554
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:03,050
we're gonna see some of them try to try

555
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:12,080
to go through if the demo gods will be

556
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:15,770
let's say let's say good to us I also

557
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,480
mentioned her that this one let's say

558
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:20,750
this one why is this one the best one so

559
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:24,170
I won't forget because it fits also to

560
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:26,900
the same casing as the rubber ducky

561
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:29,630
as you see you know at one conference in

562
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:35,840
Slovenia I got this really nice USB key

563
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:38,840
with little hardware modification one of

564
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,330
our guys managed to stick it here so

565
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,280
it's already branded you know so some

566
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,040
guys would finger it ok it's really nice

567
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:49,960
USB branded key so I can stick it in and

568
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:55,760
Bank all my secrets are secrets are gone

569
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:57,740
ok so what we gonna do now probably we

570
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,690
will run into some kind of pro a little

571
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,730
bit problems why because the camera man

572
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:05,300
is also using the logitech Wi-Fi

573
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:08,750
keyboards so what can happen

574
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:12,290
we might inject the wrong unifying

575
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:14,630
reciever so we might own him not my

576
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:17,480
computer not mine simulation but we try

577
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:20,180
to avoid this and first time are you

578
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:23,510
gonna see how you can discover all

579
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,340
devices you can actually also destroy

580
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,629
devices and you can do the passive

581
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,240
enumeration

582
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:32,510
based on different kind of the different

583
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:37,820
kind of frames and let's see if this is

584
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:42,640
gonna be working okay here it's hard to

585
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:45,470
see but I have one unified one unified

586
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,039
dongle connected to my virtual machine

587
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:53,150
so my virtual machine is going to be I'm

588
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:56,929
gonna be simulating the let's say target

589
00:31:53,150 --> 00:32:00,530
so the target I will be I will be I will

590
00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:03,710
be attacking as you can see here we have

591
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:07,190
this unifying software which is kind of

592
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:08,900
fault it's dated from 2014 so a logitech

593
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,270
is really updating their software

594
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,730
it's the latest one I downloaded

595
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:15,830
yesterday from their website it said

596
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:21,260
well that's the latest and greatest use

597
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:23,740
it and first first we're gonna see we're

598
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:26,419
gonna try to pair it with this mouse so

599
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:31,190
dongle it's imported through the virtual

600
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:36,429
USB interface and we will try to try to

601
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:36,429
pair it but before we're gonna see that

602
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:47,700
so we're gonna see that this is the

603
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:52,950
interface to that log attacker so this

604
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:55,080
is actually running on this device so

605
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:58,050
kind of as you see I still haven't

606
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:02,250
plugged in Mike my mouse but let me see

607
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:03,930
can you move a little bit mouse and you

608
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,940
see he's moving the mouse I'm getting

609
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:10,050
the already events from his Mouse

610
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:11,790
okay I will try to pair my device this

611
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:15,090
is normally done you know just plug it

612
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:17,340
in turn it off turn it on and you should

613
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:20,280
have bird miles let's see if this is

614
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,959
working okay so I have my mouse which is

615
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,399
connected to virtual machine and I can

616
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,560
move it only in virtual machine why

617
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:28,550
because my dongle is inserted into

618
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:32,040
virtual machine outside I have my

619
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:37,590
touchpad what we see here with log

620
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:43,139
attacker so we can see that we have

621
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:45,540
plenty of devices see so plenty of

622
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:49,740
devices and if I move my mouse now

623
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:55,649
you'll see that my mouse is also my

624
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:59,790
mouse is also moving so here why is this

625
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:03,300
important because you know if you're a

626
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:07,440
very large wife I hid devices

627
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:14,340
environment you might get several you

628
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:17,490
might get several devices on it now we

629
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:21,480
see device but we can still not do not

630
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:25,739
do anything but let's try to see if we

631
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:28,230
can inject it in some kind of plane

632
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:31,830
communication wine plane communication

633
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:34,440
because this this device and the the

634
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:37,529
dongle hasn't been updated so it doesn't

635
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:44,360
have any kind of let's say encryption

636
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:50,210
when I'm using my mouse let me see

637
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:50,210
so if I try to see my mouse

638
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:56,170
but probably I will have a mm-hmm which

639
00:34:55,330 --> 00:35:07,270
one is mine

640
00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:08,800
keyboard no lock disabled devices and

641
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:11,320
the possibility is also that you can

642
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,610
store all devices especially when is

643
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,800
this going to be a little bit

644
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:19,150
interesting afterwards because it can

645
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,070
store also doing keys that can be used

646
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:29,790
during the during the during the

647
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:29,790
encryption okay so if we see now here

648
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:38,920
let's see if we try to one device and

649
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,590
see oops

650
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,000
we had several devices now it's gonna be

651
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:45,910
a little bit problem when I was doing

652
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:51,850
there I only had one device and now it's

653
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:56,109
gonna be really really really fun let's

654
00:35:51,850 --> 00:36:01,950
say Lord and there's also possibility

655
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:05,950
that you can load script script load

656
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:07,270
Vulcan and this scripting it's really

657
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:14,020
interesting because it's saved on the

658
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:18,040
flash and with this you can you can do

659
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:20,920
the typing so as you see here I delayed

660
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,259
it for 4,000 milliseconds and then there

661
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:27,310
is a kind of alternative string which

662
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:31,050
it's saying hello from welcome 2019 so

663
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:34,060
this script is going to be injected into

664
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:37,090
into the channel that we are that we are

665
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:43,450
using maybe you are asking why is this

666
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:46,380
alternative shrink who's still using the

667
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,379
numerical keyboard

668
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:53,660
what if you type if you turn on the

669
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:57,010
numerical keyboard and you type 0 6 5

670
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,009
what you get on a screen

671
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:04,540
if you type the ASCII codes on the new

672
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:07,540
Malachor you will get the same behavior

673
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:09,700
as you would type a on the keyboard so

674
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,950
in this one it's actually using the the

675
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:14,470
same the same procedure so it's using

676
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:15,819
kind of turn on numerical and type on

677
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:18,100
the miracles there are six five and

678
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:20,620
that's why because the mouse and the

679
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:23,830
clickers they cannot send characters so

680
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:27,569
like a or B or C or something else so

681
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:31,360
using the log attacker is using kind of

682
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:35,290
let's say trick so if we're gonna see a

683
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:39,660
little bit it's kind of alt you know alt

684
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:39,660
something you know the menu is gonna be

685
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:46,690
menu is they're gonna be a little bit

686
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,800
playing around so if we try to see if I

687
00:37:46,690 --> 00:38:00,310
managed to find the right target

688
00:37:49,800 --> 00:38:08,080
let's see lock enable and try to move go

689
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:11,190
try to move my mouse well this is the

690
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,190
curse of the live demos

691
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:18,150
let's go run you see No

692
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:32,260
my looks like my dog attacker device

693
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:37,330
tight let me just do again this and see

694
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:37,920
if this one is gonna go run start

695
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:43,029
session

696
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:48,040
okay let's go around and see if my mouse

697
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:54,190
it's yes so it's one C one C something

698
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:55,870
so load script load Vulcan slowed

699
00:38:54,190 --> 00:39:01,660
scripts exceeded so we have the script

700
00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:05,140
show script show now we're gonna try to

701
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:07,480
inject we're gonna try to inject in this

702
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:10,120
virtual machine that somebody else is

703
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:13,780
that somebody else is using it

704
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:17,520
so we're try to inject here so injecting

705
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:21,820
target so we have the target 1 C 16 I

706
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:26,380
guess this one okay inject execute and

707
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:35,440
let's see if this one will if something

708
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:37,240
will be going on so as you see but if

709
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,970
you have been paying attention that you

710
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,770
would see that if here there was you

711
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:44,109
know something like on is what's going

712
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:46,960
on like here because it was typing alt

713
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:50,320
and the numerical keys now try the

714
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,720
different ones try to inject into this

715
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,180
one you need to show it or you trust me

716
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,230
that it's going to be the same because

717
00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:01,930
the clickers are doing the same thing so

718
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:07,160
but we can save it later don't trust

719
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:09,410
anybody I know that guy you know

720
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:12,589
he's from the crypto community you know

721
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:14,930
you shouldn't trust creep yeah while

722
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:17,780
you're wearing the t-shirt so but it's

723
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:19,460
it's really okay it's the same since

724
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:22,520
probably we're running out of time

725
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:24,530
otherwise it's the same with clickers

726
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:27,470
that's why I said you know the clickers

727
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:28,790
are really problematic and clickers what

728
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:31,939
do you think would be interesting to

729
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:36,830
inject yourself in clickers during

730
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:39,920
security conferences yes why you know

731
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:41,930
because all presenters know me I'm doing

732
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,960
the same thing you know I present with

733
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:47,419
my clicker and with my computer so if

734
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,660
you manage to inject yourself between my

735
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,630
clicker and my computer you own me

736
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:57,440
really fast but now let's move to

737
00:40:53,630 --> 00:41:02,650
another way let's try to steal the key

738
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:08,090
the EAS key and we're gonna try this

739
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:11,090
with pairing ITAT so we're gonna be

740
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:13,250
let's say there's one kind of special

741
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:15,860
condition you have to be close when the

742
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:21,680
device our prayer otherwise you know

743
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:24,410
there's no leakage of the key yes but

744
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,169
let's try to see if this one is going to

745
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:29,660
be working okay we don't have any any

746
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:33,230
device connected to our virtual machine

747
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:36,580
so you see there is no there is no no

748
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:39,320
devices and now you know I brought this

749
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:42,500
all the way from Slovenia so I'd kind of

750
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:45,170
I didn't declare it you know so I hope

751
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,960
we'll either get it back why is this

752
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:51,050
interesting well it's kinda widely used

753
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:54,470
and this time I also have this kind of

754
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:56,690
keyboard with with the cable at home but

755
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:59,649
now you cannot buy it anymore with USB

756
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:05,810
cables your wireless wireless keyboards

757
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:09,230
okay try now to catch try now to catch

758
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:14,060
the key between the parent okay let's

759
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:17,210
clear all devices remove all so we don't

760
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:20,210
have any devices life okay let's do the

761
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:23,059
pairing as normally we do it so

762
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:24,200
new device what this mean okay turning

763
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:27,470
on turning off

764
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:34,819
you see turn on turn off okay see the

765
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:36,020
key 350 my device is paired oh and I

766
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:40,910
should do something

767
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:43,490
I didn't start sniffing they're pairing

768
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:45,799
process so I have to do it again it will

769
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:50,049
take just a second okay the keyboard on

770
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:59,300
purr purr new device okay

771
00:42:50,050 --> 00:43:04,300
switch off switch on again okay C and C

772
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:04,300
and the keyboard now we managed to catch

773
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:15,020
we managed where Mikey we managed the

774
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:18,980
link key so this is actually the S key

775
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:20,920
which is responsible for securing the

776
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:26,950
communication between my keyboard and

777
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:30,319
the dongle how do we know that the my my

778
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:33,919
my keyboard is working so if I try to

779
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:36,049
write something you see I'm getting the

780
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,630
output so you see when I'm writing

781
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:43,250
something I'm getting the events also

782
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:50,119
there and fun part is that you can also

783
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:55,790
do option paths if enumeration pass

784
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:59,450
through keyboard on and whatever I'm

785
00:43:55,790 --> 00:44:02,990
typing since I have a key which is take

786
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:05,450
responsible for which is responsible for

787
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:09,529
encrypting the communication I can also

788
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:14,950
intercept all the key keystrokes so if I

789
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:24,380
manage to get the key and user it's

790
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:27,799
doing this no probably yours all doing

791
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:33,079
this right every day at least couple of

792
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:36,589
times now let's just delete here this Y

793
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:40,670
so my keyboard is played to here and so

794
00:44:36,589 --> 00:44:44,808
this virtual machine and yeah I know

795
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:51,640
what's the problem you're sniffing the

796
00:44:44,809 --> 00:44:51,640
the Wi-Fi traffic and problem is because

797
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:59,660
I'm getting the to two inputs not only

798
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:14,089
one let's me see you again

799
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:18,078
it's okay I miss type it so okay sorry I

800
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:20,180
got it I should get the passwords here

801
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:23,150
so because I'm because I'm sniffing so

802
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:27,368
we can be so we are actually men in the

803
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:31,089
middle through keyboard and through the

804
00:45:27,369 --> 00:45:34,190
dongle that has been using it okay

805
00:45:31,089 --> 00:45:38,599
what's the next demo so we can have it

806
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:43,099
we have seen it here that we managed to

807
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:43,670
get so that we only have ten minutes

808
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:47,680
left

809
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:47,680
okay we did the perky sniffing

810
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,299
additional thing that's actually can be

811
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,220
possible it's kind of using the tool

812
00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:58,819
which is called unifying

813
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:01,009
it's developing go link so you can

814
00:45:58,819 --> 00:46:02,990
compile it on Linux without any problems

815
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:06,349
and it actually dumps all the keys from

816
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:08,839
the dongle you can then use these keys

817
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:10,760
and interception intercept the

818
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:14,690
communication how is this done

819
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:19,930
let's see now I have to remove this

820
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:19,930
dongle that's now

821
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,540
what does it take to remove the dongle

822
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:27,129
in virtual space just connected to the

823
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:35,860
other one but what does this mean in

824
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:39,390
real work what do you think somebody

825
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:39,390
needs to have access to the dongle

826
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:50,880
right so the cleaning lady can copy your

827
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:54,969
dongle yes so if you're using the

828
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:57,249
unifying dongle in your hotel room and

829
00:46:54,969 --> 00:47:03,069
if you leave your computer there with

830
00:46:57,249 --> 00:47:07,390
the dongle you know to dump the keys it

831
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:09,009
takes like five seconds you can automate

832
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:11,709
it you know you can automate it with

833
00:47:09,009 --> 00:47:15,069
some Raspberry Pi or some something else

834
00:47:11,709 --> 00:47:18,848
you know just plug it in until as soon

835
00:47:15,069 --> 00:47:21,430
as the USB device is plugged in run the

836
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:24,699
run the command and you get the key from

837
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:27,308
the bundle so you see here it's really a

838
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:29,109
little bit bigger so you see this is the

839
00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:31,719
AES key that was used for the

840
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:37,569
communication between the between the

841
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:41,849
between the keyboard and my dongle put

842
00:47:37,569 --> 00:47:41,849
it back what somebody note is it

843
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:48,848
probably not and you know the cleaning

844
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:50,890
lady goes out with all your keys for all

845
00:47:48,849 --> 00:47:52,839
your devices so if you're using unified

846
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:56,078
dongle you can have up to six devices on

847
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:59,380
doing some same dongle so you have they

848
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:03,910
have all the all the keys all the keys

849
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:07,690
in it okay we dump the keys you can use

850
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:09,249
them later what is our contribution you

851
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:13,509
know we have been playing with Marcos

852
00:48:09,249 --> 00:48:15,339
Manx creations just before the summer we

853
00:48:13,509 --> 00:48:17,529
have been really honored to be the part

854
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:21,249
of private repos just before everything

855
00:48:17,529 --> 00:48:24,819
went public I'm really grateful to him

856
00:48:21,249 --> 00:48:27,640
to given us this opportunity and when we

857
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:30,219
have been playing you know we actually

858
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:32,558
it was the project of my one of my

859
00:48:30,219 --> 00:48:35,559
summer school students during this

860
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:39,690
summer and he actually managed to

861
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:43,869
develop some really small windows tool

862
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:46,209
which can do pretty same as the Logitech

863
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:47,949
the log attacker does but log attacker

864
00:48:46,209 --> 00:48:50,948
doesn't save all the key book key

865
00:48:47,949 --> 00:48:52,989
keystrokes so it doesn't have it only in

866
00:48:50,949 --> 00:48:54,860
memory so you cannot have it you cannot

867
00:48:52,989 --> 00:48:57,650
save it in a flash why because there

868
00:48:54,860 --> 00:49:02,290
limitation with the flash and other

869
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:08,360
issues but we can now save we can save

870
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:11,509
we can save this we can save all these

871
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:14,630
key locks and even if we don't have the

872
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:17,660
key we can save it for later time so

873
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:20,660
what this mean if we are agents we can

874
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:23,420
snap all traffic for several months we

875
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:26,990
don't have to have the key today but we

876
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:29,960
can get it in next month so if we have

877
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:34,040
and this is the really nice and

878
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:40,400
effective tool that one of our students

879
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:43,940
which goes under new bite zero handle it

880
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:46,250
said that we can save something and we

881
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:51,350
save something you know the keystrokes

882
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:56,030
you know for later usage we get this key

883
00:49:51,350 --> 00:50:00,259
that we somehow or the evil made if the

884
00:49:56,030 --> 00:50:03,560
evil made got this key for us so this

885
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:05,600
key and we have this keystrokes and we

886
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:09,290
got the key today so we can just use it

887
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:11,990
and we can also use the decrypt history

888
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:15,680
and we can decrypt everything that we

889
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:17,799
saved several months ago so if somebody

890
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,750
was logging on if somebody was writing

891
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:24,260
love letters if somebody has doing some

892
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:27,260
secret messaging to somewhere we can

893
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:29,810
decrypt it later under one condition

894
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:33,170
so he doesn't pair it again because then

895
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:34,640
the key keys between the devices give me

896
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:36,950
the keys between the devices are

897
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,230
changing so this one it's really

898
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:41,990
available on the github so if one if

899
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:44,360
everybody wants to use it it's free to

900
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:46,490
use it only runs on Windows at this

901
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:49,430
moment so because everything else it's

902
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:52,910
running on Linux so this is the really

903
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:57,020
nice GUI that we did we made it okay

904
00:50:52,910 --> 00:51:02,450
there's only one thing you know who is

905
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:05,680
developer here okay who is who really

906
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:05,680
likes to do quick fixes

907
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:11,800
quick fixes wrong way don't do it why I

908
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:14,859
always tell the customers you know if we

909
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:17,500
find a bug sleep over don't fix it

910
00:51:14,859 --> 00:51:20,140
immediately why because if you fix one

911
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:22,000
buck really quickly normally you're

912
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:25,060
going to introduce two mores through

913
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:30,940
three four even five more what the

914
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:33,310
logitech did they got this notification

915
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:38,500
they fix it but they fix it in a wrong

916
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:41,710
way so what was so what was a bypass of

917
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:44,190
recent logitech patch you can you know

918
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:47,710
with these dogmas you can downgrade them

919
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:49,530
so you can put them in too late not the

920
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:53,589
latest version but one version before

921
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:56,290
dump the keys upgraded it again and you

922
00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:59,290
have the keys so you know sometimes even

923
00:51:56,290 --> 00:52:01,119
fixes goes wrong I already mentioned

924
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:04,839
that so this is from Logitech unifying

925
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:07,450
software for 2014 and at the end just

926
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:09,580
for the really really close my talk

927
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:13,089
there are really crazy ideas how to use

928
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:19,630
it this is from Luca Marrone Jordan how

929
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:22,570
to use the crazy plasma ball you know as

930
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:25,089
a hit injector you know you can buy

931
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:27,250
plasma ball for like ten dollars for

932
00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:29,890
thirteen dollars you can get work hit

933
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:35,170
put it in and if somebody plugs it in

934
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:37,930
you can these devices can type they also

935
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:42,430
try to put it in Mouse so don't accept

936
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:44,140
gifts don't take gifts from from other

937
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:46,240
people you know because you never know

938
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:48,490
maybe it's a mouse maybe it's some kind

939
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,009
of hit device that's playing some other

940
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:54,040
crazy stuff

941
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:56,830
Lou Caputo also created when he was

942
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:59,790
playing with log attacker and he was a

943
00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:04,710
little bit throwing know let's say

944
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:07,540
comments and maybe he wanted to start a

945
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:10,260
holy war against the Mitnick and Vincent

946
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:13,920
who were selling the

947
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:17,520
the ninja cables 480 dollars he said

948
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:20,610
well I can do it for ten ten dollars and

949
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:25,200
what what what is he doing he's actually

950
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:30,030
injecting into the the cables the

951
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:31,230
logitech this dongles why because he can

952
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:34,800
control it with logitech ur

953
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:36,830
so well will you use my cable well I am

954
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:40,020
you know for for a charging care device

955
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:44,160
here it is and as soon as you plug it in

956
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:47,160
I control your USB USB cable so this one

957
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,870
is really interesting there is one

958
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,790
interesting question was when we were

959
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:55,259
discussing on a Twitter from my friend

960
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:57,480
he said well in Slovenian languages in

961
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:59,430
civilian language I translate what are

962
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,620
we gonna do about Logitech products

963
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:05,669
should we throw them in trash

964
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:07,319
no because they are not safe as they

965
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:10,800
should be

966
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:14,520
there's some crazy ideas also with the

967
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,410
heat injector with USB and claiming that

968
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,500
you can actually bypass air gapped

969
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:21,330
environments with this so nuclear plants

970
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,190
power plant grids you know all in gas

971
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:27,870
trains and everything that's connected

972
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:32,100
to it there's also reason why I was

973
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:37,410
asking you if there are some gamers this

974
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:39,779
is the official Logitech Twitter and

975
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:43,890
they showed a demo of the really young

976
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:48,870
guys actually cutting the USB cables of

977
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:50,700
their mouths of their Mouse's and they

978
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:53,100
said to be honest we want to switch to

979
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:55,470
wireless Mouse's you know the G Series

980
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:57,630
from Logitech it can really handle

981
00:54:55,470 --> 00:55:02,540
really good it's really good for the

982
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:05,990
gamers can you get some idea what crazy

983
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:05,990
things can go wrong

984
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:15,270
long well I have a LAN party pwnage have

985
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:17,850
you ever been to LAN party LAN party no

986
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:20,220
you have 300 guys you know and she

987
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:22,830
hundred wireless masses which are never

988
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:24,000
updated probably and you can inject into

989
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:26,339
their computers

990
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,890
you know and the gaming computers are

991
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:33,720
really good for mining so because they

992
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:35,788
have really good nothing okay and some

993
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,098
other stuff you know they yesterday we

994
00:55:35,789 --> 00:55:41,460
heard the presentation about the Saudi

995
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:45,359
Aramco and how was done and this was

996
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:48,509
from news from today came drone attacks

997
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:51,359
on Saudi Aramco you know so there have

998
00:55:48,509 --> 00:55:56,329
been from yesterday yesterday's speech

999
00:55:51,359 --> 00:56:00,150
to drone attacks which would make quite

1000
00:55:56,329 --> 00:56:02,339
quite big damage but why is this

1001
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:09,150
interesting because look up on journey

1002
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:11,308
is playing also with his his drone to

1003
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:14,420
scan and inject into everything that

1004
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:16,130
John finds so he can send it several

1005
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:19,710
kilometres away

1006
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:23,549
inject themselves into the logitech in

1007
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:26,009
secure communication on the world so you

1008
00:56:23,549 --> 00:56:29,609
see there are really really great and

1009
00:56:26,009 --> 00:56:34,799
crazy ideas okay just for the really end

1010
00:56:29,609 --> 00:56:39,660
you know what should we do does anybody

1011
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:42,359
watch we should disable all us bees why

1012
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:44,430
is this possible probably not you know

1013
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:46,078
because even if you disabled on your

1014
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:48,419
notebook you're still if you're using

1015
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,470
the docking station probably you don't

1016
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,839
disable it there

1017
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:56,009
what about never use any USB device

1018
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:57,509
again probably also not well what what

1019
00:56:56,009 --> 00:57:00,240
we can do is there from the end point

1020
00:56:57,509 --> 00:57:03,960
USB device management application in

1021
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:06,689
system to monitor what kind of each

1022
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:09,390
devices are connecting hits event sent

1023
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:12,390
to sim so if you have it sent to there

1024
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:17,240
and of course there is also another and

1025
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:20,490
it digital forensics here guys okay

1026
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:22,288
it's your digital or forensic and

1027
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:25,049
incidents reporting ready for his

1028
00:57:22,289 --> 00:57:27,299
devices so do you know what everything

1029
00:57:25,049 --> 00:57:30,180
has been plugged in what everything can

1030
00:57:27,299 --> 00:57:32,220
was let's say run on cool on a computer

1031
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:35,190
what kind of devices so there are a lot

1032
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:37,180
of questions and I will end with this

1033
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:41,289
so and

1034
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:43,990
it looks like you know the hit devices

1035
00:57:41,289 --> 00:57:46,960
you know that started in 2016 s they're

1036
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:49,930
coming back again you know so we should

1037
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:53,309
make the hit devices apocalypse great

1038
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:53,308
again so thank you very much

1039
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:06,770
and since I said it was my research so

1040
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:09,020
if your plan to play with it Marko's

1041
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:11,840
it's really nice guy he responds really

1042
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:13,040
fast these are the reference that I try

1043
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,840
to put together where all the

1044
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,119
presentations and everything is it's

1045
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,580
really good start to do it and thank you

1046
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:23,200
very much again any questions just

1047
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:23,200
before because I know I'm late

1048
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:31,849
one question yeah we only have time for

1049
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:35,480
one it's actually correction partly

1050
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:38,420
mouths Jake also works on unified

1051
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:41,510
dongles itself and since you buy known

1052
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:44,030
now know that unified dongles are

1053
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:46,760
you can just refresh it with magic

1054
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:49,340
that's one and the other is that your

1055
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:52,040
trick for generating ASCII characters

1056
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:54,140
actually works on your windows yes yes

1057
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:57,680
yes yes definitely

1058
00:58:54,140 --> 00:59:03,109
since my was cool so the additional

1059
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:05,470
suggestion is here use Linux okay thank

1060
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:05,470
you very much

1061
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:31,170
