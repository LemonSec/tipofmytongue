1
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:39,320
alright so next up we have PC dog with

2
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:40,040
our PKA validation so good afternoon

3
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,830
everyone

4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,989
after knowing how people invade

5
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,599
embassies now let's see how we can

6
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:51,169
secure the underlying infrastructure or

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,660
in this case the Internet so what I'm

8
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,629
going to talk about is in a first step a

9
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:59,269
little bit for people who have not the

10
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:03,140
same background as me as how how does

11
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:04,908
the internet actually work like relevant

12
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,479
in this case also is what is actually

13
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:12,770
BGP why we need such a thing as our PCI

14
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,990
and how you can actually do that if you

15
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,619
run a network if you run BGP how you can

16
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,550
roll it out but let's first see what's

17
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:24,080
the Internet

18
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:25,908
well that's the internet kind of I think

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,820
people as some people at least know

20
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:30,950
where this has been this has been the

21
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,440
colocation at a recent event I've been

22
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:38,150
speaking about the same topic in Carl's

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,980
way so this is KP and colocation you

24
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:44,780
have to admire the professional I'm

25
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:49,100
stacking with Marte boxes that's it

26
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:53,180
works anyway so if we talk about the

27
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:57,289
internet we talk about IP so there's two

28
00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:02,080
kinds of IP this IP before all you know

29
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:06,830
ipv4 honestly this is legacy it's from

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:11,450
1981 this is older than most of us here

31
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:14,030
and I would like to start because it

32
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,940
should be legacy it should stop being

33
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,250
used let's call it IP legacy so we can

34
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,760
actually also shame all the vendors who

35
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:26,420
still only support legacy on their new

36
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,090
products and so when I talk about IP I

37
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:33,559
talk about ipv6 sometimes I do a mistake

38
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:36,080
happy to be corrected and yeah by the

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,040
way ipv4

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,220
as of yesterday ripe now announced that

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,859
with all the people joining ripe they're

42
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:49,160
officially up going to be out now so if

43
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:52,190
you try to get ipv4 addresses IP legacy

44
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,520
addresses ripe will tell you no can do

45
00:02:52,190 --> 00:03:00,650
you're out so the time is I finally

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:04,040
officially over so I'm a little bit more

47
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,890
about lingo a prefix that's if you have

48
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,650
a an address that's the fixed part the

49
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,809
part that whenever your name a host is

50
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,020
always in front of it that's the prefix

51
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:17,570
that's why it's called a prefix an

52
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:20,050
Internet we only route prefixes we don't

53
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:24,200
care about individual host addresses

54
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:26,930
while in this case the host part is

55
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,089
what's freely interchangeable and you

56
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,980
should not reuse because well it will

57
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,970
collide if you have two times the same

58
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:37,640
host part come back a bit about what's

59
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:40,340
the internet so the internet is a bunch

60
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,049
of networks it's a big mesh everyone can

61
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,830
run their own network as long as you

62
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:48,470
have an identifier you have a few you

63
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,690
have probably need an es you're an

64
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:55,280
autonomous system so you need an es

65
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:56,989
number to get your identifiers and well

66
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,470
you can't do much if you have a network

67
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:02,570
but you have no network addresses so if

68
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,880
you want to be part of the Internet if

69
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,040
you want to be on that level you also

70
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,620
need a certain amount of prefixes at

71
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,370
least one it can be IP or it can be IP

72
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:16,668
legacy and that makes you an ISP an

73
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:19,130
autumn element system well okay now you

74
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:22,240
have a bunch of IP addresses you have

75
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:25,100
your net block you have your a s number

76
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,110
cool your network runs but how do you

77
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,540
talk to your neighbor how do you talk to

78
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,400
Google how do you reach Netflix how do

79
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,570
you reach your customers how do you do

80
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:39,169
your whatever online streaming well

81
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:41,480
that's through two things one of them is

82
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:45,260
called peering and one of them is called

83
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:47,389
transit so let's say I have a network

84
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,740
here in

85
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:52,120
let's say I have a network in

86
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:56,389
Switzerland and you guys are using SBB

87
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:59,599
so all I had to do is to ask SBB hey

88
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:02,990
let's establish a cable in between so

89
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:04,938
people who are here honest VP and they

90
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:08,659
send an email to me it goes for

91
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:11,300
appearing I don't pay SBB a dime SBB

92
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:15,530
doesn't pay me a dime we have on a

93
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:18,259
mutual level on a level appearing we

94
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:22,789
exchange traffic that's how it's

95
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:25,330
supposed to be in most cases but you

96
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:29,090
can't do that to all of the other

97
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:32,389
probably 60,000 a SS in the world how do

98
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:35,049
you run 60,000 cables across the globe

99
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:38,629
it's not gonna be really financially

100
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:41,949
viable it's not gonna scale and also

101
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:45,259
it's really messy bowl of cables so

102
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:47,539
sometimes you're like okay why don't I

103
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:50,529
pay someone to do that for me well

104
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:53,719
that's exactly what's called transy so

105
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:55,940
mean it's a service provider I have to

106
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:58,479
pay multiple companies even because I

107
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:01,580
don't want to ride on just one so I pay

108
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,169
five transit providers now and they

109
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,889
bring me to all the world so they are

110
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:09,969
now contractually obliged to deliver my

111
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:15,860
packets everywhere in the world and

112
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:20,839
obviously transit is not free well this

113
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:24,889
is the reality Network worlds so you all

114
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:30,430
know and sometimes it effects BGP as

115
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:32,990
well so anyway what's BGP so a BGP is a

116
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:37,279
standard protocol we're currently

117
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:41,000
running portion v4 and we mostly use it

118
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:45,439
to exchange information because it can

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,229
carry multiple types of information so

120
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:52,939
what I normally do is through bgp i

121
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:57,210
announce to the world hey I'm here and I

122
00:06:52,939 --> 00:07:03,690
want to be able to use network X

123
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:06,810
so I announced my prefix and I also do

124
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:10,080
that by it's telling hey and on by the

125
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:12,840
way I'm a s five eight to nine nine and

126
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,710
I have these prefixes you can send your

127
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,270
packets for these prefixes to me

128
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,948
it is pretty scalable I mean we're

129
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:24,180
running it with millions of objects

130
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:26,160
nowadays so that works pretty well it

131
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,630
just takes forever to load depending on

132
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,360
the router you have depending on the

133
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:34,050
vendor you have it takes twenty minutes

134
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:40,050
or one minute so it really depends a bit

135
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:42,389
on that with BGP well it one's fine it

136
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,880
runs very well but it was designed in a

137
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:46,800
time where there were a couple hundred a

138
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,930
couple thousands of networks and

139
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,210
everyone know knew each other and people

140
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,130
were like yeah nobody's gonna do any

141
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,780
crap on the internet because yeah we

142
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:59,490
know our colleagues we know they're

143
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:01,349
trustworthy well yeah so with BGP if you

144
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,169
just run it with an out-of-the-box

145
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:08,219
configuration on your router it just

146
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:11,669
trusts everyone so if you run BGP with

147
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,220
me I will tell you hey by the way you

148
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:17,490
can reach eight eight eight dot zero

149
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:20,280
slash 24 which is the network for the

150
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,020
Google DNS and you will reach it from me

151
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,130
and because we have a direct route you

152
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:28,680
might actually prefer that well yeah

153
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:32,809
what could possibly go wrong

154
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:37,080
I mean Pakistan telecom once

155
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:39,659
demonstrated that so yeah the first

156
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,709
level of defense that's been done since

157
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:47,160
I don't know tens of years is we put up

158
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:49,529
whitelist so we say hey this is what you

159
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,140
can send me this is the predefined list

160
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:54,870
you sent me an email with the list of

161
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,520
net blocks you announce and well we have

162
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,570
a gentleman's agreement that you're not

163
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:04,010
that you actually didn't lie nice

164
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:06,930
concept cronies it doesn't scale and

165
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:09,300
again it's a gentleman agreement because

166
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,769
I have to trust my upstream so if

167
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,859
someone else has like hey

168
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:15,980
if you give you a box of beer can I also

169
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:20,850
announce this object that is not mine

170
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:22,800
yay so people were like we need a

171
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:26,639
central place we need a database for

172
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:31,410
that yay databases because nobody ever

173
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:34,739
put anything alleged in a database also

174
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:38,160
there's like old net blocks from before

175
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:40,110
there were even those databases that

176
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,660
were not registered and you can have a

177
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:45,839
hard time registering it so it can be

178
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:48,299
messy you can you can create your

179
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,299
filters every night you can just go in

180
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:54,540
and say okay I want to auto-generate

181
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:57,420
those filters except your router needs

182
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:01,618
to support that and that's the next

183
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:05,819
problem couple so what's the next thing

184
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:07,499
to do I mean yeah cryptography nothing

185
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:11,248
ever got wrong with cryptography so

186
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:14,399
let's add API to it let's add so the

187
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:17,189
Internet as of principle it's

188
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,230
decentralized so there is no central

189
00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:24,029
point of anger there is no central point

190
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:27,389
of truth until now so the current state

191
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:31,079
of the art is to introduce a PKI

192
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:33,929
into the internet I'm not touching it

193
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:36,449
I'm not valuing it if that's a good or

194
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:39,119
bad idea but I guess people should make

195
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:41,729
their own decision and also participate

196
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:44,309
in the community do we really want to

197
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:48,779
have a central anger point in Internet I

198
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:52,949
mean to be honest let's say a Dutch

199
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:57,269
Court has something against Pirate Bay

200
00:10:52,949 --> 00:11:03,089
and because right which is responsible

201
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:05,759
for the rpi database in Europe will be

202
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:07,980
forced by a Dutch Court to retract the

203
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,739
signature for whatever network they

204
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,899
consider as a bad network now and since

205
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:15,589
ripe is Dutch they have to oblige starts

206
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:20,519
law and that's the current standard

207
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:22,350
scenario so once we have a PGI public

208
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,950
key infrastructure we're also opening

209
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,550
doors

210
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:29,010
censorship censorship they might work

211
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,359
better than DNS censoring in Richland

212
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,520
but that's a different story

213
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,240
and honestly I really don't want my

214
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:39,380
internet oh sorry that was how the hell

215
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,380
did I jump sorry

216
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:48,810
let's go it I don't want my internet to

217
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:51,620
look like that because that's what you

218
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:54,780
get if you start breaking the internet

219
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:59,120
so let's briefly go back again to those

220
00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:02,100
regional entities so we have five

221
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:07,140
regional regional as in five regions of

222
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:10,830
the earth network rich histories they

223
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:14,730
are the anchor point for RPG ollie so

224
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:18,600
since I live in amia in European and

225
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:20,640
Middle Malaya since I'm here I'm a

226
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,520
member of ripe since I'm a member of

227
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,949
ripe I have to put up the signatures in

228
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:29,730
the right rear portal so let's say I

229
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:32,100
want to to create a signature that I

230
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,770
actually want to use this net block with

231
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,740
this a s number and I put a

232
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:41,160
cryptographic signature trait then they

233
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,170
looks like this so you can see I have

234
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:47,969
different networks I have an IP network

235
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:50,250
which is origin is 30 no 30 which is in

236
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,590
each seven that's actually in a network

237
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:55,230
I use outside of my network because I

238
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:59,790
don't want to have everything with me I

239
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:03,630
can even so you who have the net block

240
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:06,500
will sign it and not the ISP who uses

241
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,700
your IP addresses so you will also see

242
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,940
indirectly when someone starts using

243
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,440
your IP addresses and announces it you

244
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,330
will see hey they chose up

245
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,580
hey this network is routed with this

246
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:20,030
origin and you're like I don't know what

247
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:25,050
that is you can also use it as a

248
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:30,180
monitoring tool so i for example went in

249
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:33,560
here and said okay I have a s 55 8 - 9 9

250
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:38,359
and I sign that I announce

251
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:43,819
the 185 for 48.0 / 22 which is a

252
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:47,560
thousand 24 IP addresses now going back

253
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:50,720
a little bit to the Pakistan Telecom and

254
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:53,209
back in the day I think it's 1012 years

255
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,190
ago I don't remember what was it do you

256
00:13:53,210 --> 00:14:00,770
remember seven or eight years yeah so

257
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:04,640
what happens with Pakistan Telecom the

258
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:06,650
local telco registry like there like in

259
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,439
Finland that would be traffic home here

260
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:14,630
I don't know in in Germany would be the

261
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:17,060
Bennett's are ordered the ISPs and in

262
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:20,560
this case the Pakistani telecom to block

263
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:23,989
access to YouTube now this network was a

264
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,829
slash 20 frayed 512 IP addresses and

265
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:32,200
some network engineer just try to put in

266
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:35,089
a rule and so called black hole route

267
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,400
but they created it as 2 times the slash

268
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:41,060
24 for whatever reason probably they

269
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:44,810
didn't know better what they did not

270
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:46,849
realize is because BGP as it behaves is

271
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:50,479
when there is a static route it will

272
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:55,280
announce it now if they had created a

273
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:57,140
slash 23 512 IP addresses nothing would

274
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:01,910
have happened but because they created a

275
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:05,780
more narrow announcement all the traffic

276
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:08,870
flew to Pakistan instead of YouTube

277
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:11,990
because Bay's role in routing is you

278
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:14,480
look for the smallest net block the most

279
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:18,380
precise net book the most precise route

280
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:21,350
is to one you validate first why is this

281
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,390
so because otherwise your default

282
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:27,020
gateway would always win because that's

283
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:28,699
the least specific route so since you

284
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:32,029
know we have a default route in most

285
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,560
systems like on your PC you have a

286
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:35,270
default route but you can add more

287
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,640
specific it's obvious that the more

288
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:40,250
specific route is always evaluated and

289
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:44,270
Pakistan Telecom created a more specific

290
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:46,720
route now where can our PGI help us here

291
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:51,040
well fortunately I

292
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:54,040
can define for a net block here that I

293
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,550
want to only announce it up to a size of

294
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:00,939
a / 22 so whenever something happens

295
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:02,649
even if a route comes up which spoofs my

296
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:04,329
a s number because that's also possible

297
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:08,139
that someone not only steals my IP

298
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:10,779
addresses but also my a s number at

299
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:12,490
least they're not able to capture all

300
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:15,839
the traffic by suddenly announcing it

301
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,769
with my alias number but more specific

302
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,560
because then they get all the traffic

303
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:25,000
this way they get part of the traffic

304
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,410
and only from the ISPs who do not do

305
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,819
their job right because you should never

306
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:35,379
be able to hijack an ASN and yeah I mean

307
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:38,378
by way this is this is how you do

308
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:40,060
management networks you put in a cop

309
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:46,509
recipe and you put it to the management

310
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:50,969
port well done guys so going back to our

311
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:54,279
picky eye so let's repeat again you need

312
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:57,059
any s number which you can get it

313
00:16:54,279 --> 00:17:00,399
doesn't cost a fortune you need a

314
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:03,519
network block well you can get P

315
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,559
eyespace from from sponsoring layers so

316
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,010
you can't participate without breaking

317
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:09,699
the bank

318
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:13,359
kostya I think a total of 150 150 euro

319
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:16,000
in setup fees with ripe costs and stuff

320
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,819
you just need a friendly ISP there's a

321
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,809
few around here I think there's more

322
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:25,809
than just me and now you can start

323
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:28,000
validating RPG I mean you can this

324
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:31,330
different software components tastes

325
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,780
something called a validator server that

326
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:39,070
you need to run I know about the route

327
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:41,408
inator 3000 which is what I was using

328
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:44,289
because from ripe there is a thing

329
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:48,909
called rpki validator and dis finger on

330
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:51,129
zhongshan I never like okay Java no I'm

331
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:54,400
not even gonna look at it no just just

332
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:57,030
just just no I don't know who had the

333
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,310
brilliant idea to run this on Java but

334
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:02,200
no because now Oracle

335
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:04,000
if I run this I guess Oracle because

336
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,070
it's Oracle they will then come and say

337
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,390
hey you have to pay licenses for it

338
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,189
because you're using in commercial I'm

339
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:12,070
pretty sure they do that we first look

340
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:13,990
box now they check the download locks

341
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,700
and they see you for a thousand bucks

342
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,880
that's what happened last week

343
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,220
oh yeah and with our PGI if you want to

344
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,740
run it and if you want to validate what

345
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,470
you're getting from the internet you

346
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,660
also need a capable router and a special

347
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:35,560
with a capable router I mean routing

348
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:38,860
software which can do our PGI I think by

349
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:42,100
us does it ubiquity does not support it

350
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:44,459
newer Cisco IOS definitely do supported

351
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,469
juniper should support it

352
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,480
older brocade versions I have seen not

353
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:54,000
supporting it I don't know about newer

354
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,000
ones but I didn't see anything and

355
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,660
depending on you don't need a routing

356
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,270
software which also does routing you

357
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,920
just need something that speaks BGP to

358
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,960
play with it so you can also use

359
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,150
something like I think it's called bio

360
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:12,150
routing but I don't know if it's

361
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:17,590
actually by OS in there's no artificial

362
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:22,630
stuff in it anyway so but you don't have

363
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:25,449
RPI yet right and normally what I have

364
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:27,910
to do is in the config with the US I had

365
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:31,810
to create a route map to say hey for

366
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:35,740
this upstream push it through the RPI

367
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:37,679
engine so I wanted to get this is

368
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:41,140
working to get this started

369
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:44,050
so it's actually pretty simple you

370
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,840
follow the manual and then there's the

371
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:49,030
terms and conditions file if your file

372
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:53,919
did you use to have to download I think

373
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:55,810
that's finally gone now but when I set

374
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,060
it up I had to download a file from

375
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:02,020
airing to claim that I've accept that

376
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:05,080
they're their terms and then you launch

377
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,970
it and it just starts downloading all

378
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,580
those signature files and that takes a

379
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,970
while and

380
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:13,250
it is about to be rewritten that it's

381
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,070
faster but it took quite some time for

382
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,960
me and in the meantime I went on and I

383
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,820
had to fix an access point because the

384
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,690
customer claimed the access point wasn't

385
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,689
working anymore

386
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:26,000
well I don't know what's wrong with this

387
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:30,500
the Wi-Fi works you see the light is on

388
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,530
all peachy you just put some some super

389
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:37,100
glue and tape on it it worked again so

390
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:39,200
if you have a wireless router the slides

391
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:41,570
I can upload again for a reference it's

392
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,680
pretty simply have one statement which

393
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:47,870
says hey for a protocol RPI here's the

394
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,360
IP address here support done and we'll

395
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:53,689
connect to the server do it downloading

396
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,639
the validation so that means you need a

397
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,620
separate virtual machine which downloads

398
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,850
they are pre-qualified so you need to be

399
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:04,699
VM somewhere and then you put it you

400
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:08,300
point your router to it and then I'm

401
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,130
like okay so I have an upstream and for

402
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,620
all the routes I get from the upstream

403
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:15,520
with the upstream has a route map guess

404
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:20,260
whatever and I say all the incoming file

405
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:24,320
well check and if it's our PGI valid

406
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:26,240
define the community to this so PGP

407
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,429
communities just like put a sticker to

408
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,850
it if it's valid tag it with nine one

409
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:34,130
nine one zero zero that's artificial

410
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,750
sticker yellow sticker for everything

411
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:40,250
that validator I want a yellow sticker

412
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:42,620
right now and if it's not put a red

413
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,750
sticker on it right now this was the

414
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:51,260
stage the first stage when I tested it

415
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:53,030
and you can also say RPI neurologist

416
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,210
drop the route if there's a route in the

417
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:59,360
routing table which is clearly invalid

418
00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:02,080
which is someone has put on a signature

419
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,949
on their route and something went wrong

420
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,780
probably because either it's

421
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:08,150
misconfigured or someone is doing

422
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:12,470
something nasty then drop it

423
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:15,530
it means if there is no RPG I signature

424
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:18,340
on it then it can be ignored it will

425
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:25,600
nothing will happen it will not be

426
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:27,429
dropped and it will not be put higher by

427
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,320
the way if it has a fiber optic

428
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:32,500
connection and your signal level is too

429
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,480
high all you have to do is you take your

430
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,270
fiber cable you put it at a very tight

431
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,580
angle and because you lose some I light

432
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:43,540
because it has to go those tight angles

433
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:45,399
that's how you do it or not the ear

434
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,920
works fine your works fine for quite

435
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,920
some time

436
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:53,830
yeah you can also use a pen and you can

437
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:57,130
just wrap your fiber around the pen I

438
00:22:53,830 --> 00:23:01,300
think you lose about one DBM to 2 DBM

439
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:03,580
per going round so you can about measure

440
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:08,440
it and then you tape it on that's that's

441
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:12,070
something called a pen you ater um some

442
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:16,150
statistics I've made a few weeks ago how

443
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:18,610
many of those roads routes were actually

444
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:22,210
signed valid the numbers go up every

445
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:24,010
week and I tested about two months ago I

446
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,280
think it was about a hundred thousand

447
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:29,440
routes which were fine and interesting

448
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:34,149
enough about four and a half thousand

449
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,880
routes were marked is invalid out of

450
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:39,430
those most that I've seen that were

451
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:43,390
invalid were routes where someone

452
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:47,050
clearly defined no more specific so no

453
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:49,360
small small prefix should exist what

454
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,970
they still did it so that was kind of a

455
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,729
problem it does not cause any routing

456
00:23:51,970 --> 00:24:00,760
issue it will just cause an issue of

457
00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:04,240
traffic optimization so yeah and if you

458
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:08,560
then go ahead and you don't clean your

459
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:15,150
router do it like this your routing will

460
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:18,550
fail with even without RPI a few sources

461
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:22,180
the local search ripe net is one website

462
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:24,850
that I've I've used some material on

463
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:26,680
these slides and also D the whole bodies

464
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:28,908
are picky I you can read more about it

465
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:34,320
and

466
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:38,629
also you can contact me on those things

467
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:41,249
so I prefer nowadays to use matrix

468
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:46,019
because it's easier to encrypt than

469
00:24:41,249 --> 00:24:48,480
anything else and then something else

470
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:51,779
happens so I had this talk at Cape Anne

471
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,240
before and I was preparing those slides

472
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:56,820
and then I got an internal message

473
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,860
because the CCC has their nice postal

474
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,080
system and in the middle of the things

475
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,740
while I was doing the slides I got this

476
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:08,809
message now and now I have more material

477
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:11,789
so someone asked us on the Cape the end

478
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:14,340
if we're actually validating because the

479
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:15,869
CCC obviously because we need a lot of

480
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,059
IP addresses and we have a lot of

481
00:25:15,869 --> 00:25:19,678
network engineer the CCC prefers to do

482
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:24,450
their finger on their own so we're on

483
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:27,059
our own Network our own ASN so I

484
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:29,809
actually went to to the NOC and I was

485
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:35,428
asking about more specific information

486
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:38,668
and so even the CCC what they do right

487
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:43,639
now is my status we don't accept RFC

488
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:50,179
1918 who here knows what RFC 1918 is

489
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:57,090
come on at least you know it RFC 1918 is

490
00:25:50,179 --> 00:26:03,749
an old RFC saying 10.00 / 8 + 1 7 2 16 /

491
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:05,759
12 + 1 + 2 1 6 8 / 16 are used for

492
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:09,980
private network and can be used while

493
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:19,799
laters newer RFC's who said who are

494
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:23,610
similar who set away 100 of 64 / / 12

495
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:26,789
again I think so pretty large block but

496
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:28,860
hundred / 64 is to be used for carrier

497
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:32,039
right not so it should not be used

498
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:34,559
internal but sometimes you see on your

499
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:36,690
router if you go to your router from

500
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,930
your ISP you see an IP address with 100

501
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:42,720
opt 6465 and you're like

502
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:45,710
why can't I reach my webcam at home

503
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,510
anymore well that's because your ISP

504
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:52,470
probably doesn't have any more IP legacy

505
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:55,440
space left and they probably have given

506
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:58,260
your ipv6 so you should make sure you

507
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,280
have ipv6 enabled on your network and if

508
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:06,900
they don't give you ipv6 start complaint

509
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:08,430
to your ISP and leave them so no carry a

510
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,220
great not because they should not show

511
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:13,710
up in the global routing table you

512
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,530
should never accept your own IP space so

513
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,120
if if you go to the internet with your

514
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,980
own network and someone else tells you

515
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,479
that they have your IP addresses trust

516
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,400
me there's something fishy going on

517
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,910
there's also IP addresses for

518
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:29,880
documentation like one one nine two zero

519
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:32,310
two zero slash 24 and it's about three

520
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,420
or four more example IP addresses for

521
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:37,379
documentation and I've seen people

522
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,060
announcing that to the internet because

523
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,490
they were literally typing down the

524
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:44,550
documentation and thought it was a good

525
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:46,500
idea there's also special purposes for

526
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:48,450
speed testing should not ever show up

527
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:54,180
you should not accept multicast because

528
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:57,230
you don't do IPTV you should only accept

529
00:27:54,180 --> 00:28:00,840
IP address a certain length which is

530
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:06,440
nothing smaller than a slash 24 same

531
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:09,179
thing with ipv6 nothing nothing larger

532
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,730
than a slash 19 should be announced

533
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,970
because there is no ISP who has ever got

534
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:16,590
an IP space more than slash 90 so it

535
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,990
really is interesting to look at the

536
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:24,120
routing table and see what crap goes

537
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:27,090
around there I also use a different tool

538
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:30,090
for that on a bio routing but I run the

539
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:32,790
rania BGP from another friend of mine

540
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:35,280
who which is an awesome tool to see what

541
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:39,270
crap comes around the internet it's

542
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:43,500
worse than you think and yeah the C free

543
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:46,470
knock we we don't do our PGI yet they're

544
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:50,550
not enough people who are picky I yet I

545
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:53,820
think the only major network which

546
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:55,710
gasps RPG is probably entity but that's

547
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,460
because of one of their employees is

548
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:01,770
really pushing it yo

549
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:05,820
so yeah in any case make sure your

550
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:10,110
network does not look like this and this

551
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:13,889
is this is seriously a wireless carrier

552
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:17,280
here in Serbia so this is a mikrotik

553
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:19,230
router and on the left you have this you

554
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,600
have this Wi-Fi card you see actually

555
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:25,530
the thin antenna cable coming out of it

556
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:28,800
this was in on the roof on the sheet

557
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:31,290
insulation a cardboard box a mikrotik in

558
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:34,680
it and then a thin cable going out to

559
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:37,740
the roof connecting to the antenna

560
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:39,960
connecting to the next tower so for me

561
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,330
this was the state of Internet you're in

562
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,130
Serbia sometimes I know it goes better

563
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:49,649
so make sure to make it better because

564
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:52,070
that's what I found in yeah any

565
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,070
questions

566
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,790
there's also BGP workshop coming up

567
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:22,220
so human a separate it's a very small

568
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:22,220
washing machine let me briefly see

569
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,890
I'm not using that screen to type just

570
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,490
give me a second because I don't want to

571
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:35,970
have a mess anything up but give me a

572
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,970
second

573
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,879
is it on the left or on the right now

574
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:57,899
it's on the right

575
00:30:47,879 --> 00:31:05,009
oh I need to stop how do I need to

576
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:07,350
mirror it yeah give ya know I don't yeah

577
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:11,700
then then come over and fix it please

578
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:21,289
just give me a sec I also need to make

579
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:30,830
it bigger hmm yeah give me a second

580
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:30,830
just ah I don't have a mouse I'm on it

581
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:38,479
almost there

582
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:47,010
so that should be the same screen now

583
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,630
okay I also need another font

584
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:06,690
mana bald mano

585
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:12,000
okay everyone should be able to read

586
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,000
that

587
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:28,299
okay

588
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,140
whoo okay almost there

589
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:52,240
okay that's 150 one three one one seven

590
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,240
one was it

591
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:15,559
so that's your answer

592
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:21,440
I'm right now it uses 80 max of RAM it

593
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:30,049
has a decent CPU which is a D 1540 but

594
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:32,559
it uses no resources yeah uses no

595
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,559
resources

596
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:42,279
sorry whoa

597
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:54,510
yeah well Eddie Mac is nothing so yeah

598
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:58,320
you can run it on a PC engine tape to

599
00:33:54,510 --> 00:34:00,629
you easily not even an APU to need it or

600
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,379
an Alex probably an Alex will be a bit

601
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:08,250
it so it needs more CPU because it has

602
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:11,160
to be doing cryptographic validation it

603
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:16,350
has to check the signatures but that's

604
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:18,960
it yeah yeah it updates every 15 minutes

605
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:21,620
oh yeah that's also thing if you run our

606
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,150
PGI it will delay you 15 minutes with

607
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,969
accepting new routes if someone pushes

608
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:29,190
it up at the same time so you should

609
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:32,428
always think ahead also if you re an

610
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:34,200
ounce something with our PGI it will

611
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:36,990
delay you because people need to parse

612
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:40,020
in your RPI database and I know P is P

613
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:43,250
to do it once every 24 hours so you

614
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:49,040
can't really change it that fast anymore

615
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:49,040
yeah what more questions

616
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,690
and if there is someone here who wants

617
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,200
to figure out PGP and has not done yet

618
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:03,400
BGP Yuta is gonna be a workshop on

619
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:06,250
Sunday morning I think after a

620
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:10,720
colleague's so I would recommend to

621
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:12,760
sober up fast and and also before before

622
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:18,120
our colleagues eat eat

623
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,120
I know what I say eat enough

624
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:25,680
and then the UNSC password

625
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,410
good point

626
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,810
which one

627
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:57,249
look

628
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,920
oops this one

629
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,830
you
