1
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:31,799
next up our modern command-line tools

2
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,669
final possibly aversion you'll see by

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,669
later thank you

4
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:43,080
so it's it's me between you and the last

5
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,879
talk and the closing session so I'll try

6
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,330
to keep it as short as entertaining as

7
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,670
possible see if I can do that yeah I

8
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:53,360
thought last year I covered all the

9
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,190
interest in command-line tools and

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,470
thanks to a wonderful bunch of people

11
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:03,209
especially Clara's I have quite a lot of

12
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:05,010
content again so this will be similar to

13
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,049
last year's talk if you have seen it but

14
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,840
the content apart from the chokes are

15
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,090
from the bad jokes is completely

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,729
different so hopefully I will not bore

17
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,790
you too much hashtag as you know is pal

18
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,700
coming to k-19 I'm Lara you can find me

19
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,799
on Twitter or mastodons and the slides

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,970
will be available on my home page the

21
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,190
link will be at the end of the

22
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,298
presentation so you can just relax and

23
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,829
enjoy more or less enjoy the ride to

24
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:33,810
cover a few points that I covered in

25
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,759
last year's talk as well but just to

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,450
repeat them so you know what what I'm

27
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:44,250
talking about I'm doing this because I

28
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:48,570
noticed I'm almost turning 50 that I

29
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,820
have a natural aversion to new things

30
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,359
this I noticed is quite a few years ago

31
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,038
and apparently I'm the famous science

32
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,009
fiction author Douglas Adams also

33
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:03,270
recognize this and phrase this in his

34
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,740
wonderful world words that anything that

35
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,450
is in the world when you're born it's

36
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,068
normal and ordinary and it's just a

37
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,960
natural part of the way the world works

38
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:10,739
so if you're one of the younger persons

39
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,660
in the audience

40
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,000
cell phones internet that's all

41
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,700
completely natural to us for for me it

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,580
was a big thing so anything that's been

43
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,100
invited when you're between 15 and 35 is

44
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,900
new and exciting and it's revolutionary

45
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,250
and you can probably make a career out

46
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,950
of it so it's like the internet or

47
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,400
computers as IT security is something

48
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,589
like that but and that's the downside

49
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,030
anything invented after you turn 35 is

50
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,300
against the natural order of

51
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,160
things so if you haven't turned 35 yet

52
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,630
wait for it it will dis feel and will

53
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:47,250
come so that's our typical reaction to

54
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,019
technologies and I thought I will I will

55
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,150
I will

56
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,790
conquered this problem I will all work

57
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,530
on myself to take a look at new tools

58
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,340
and that's how the this is this talk and

59
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,739
this talk series exam came into

60
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,080
existence so what I'm talking about I'm

61
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,459
talking about UNIX command-line tools so

62
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,530
these are tools that are standalone

63
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,140
tools that don't do not need a server

64
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,970
that do not need an OTS installation

65
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:15,480
like an Nvidia driver or the video card

66
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:18,290
driver or anything else so all these

67
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,799
tools follow the UNIX philosophy first

68
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:26,160
introduced by dr. McElroy in 1978 which

69
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,400
basically said make each program do one

70
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:33,180
thing well to a new chopper tilt refresh

71
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,250
rate and complicate all programs expect

72
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,489
you put of every program to become the

73
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:41,250
input of another yet unknown program do

74
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:46,110
not clap the output there are excellent

75
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,820
talks on the on the development of the

76
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,519
UNIX tools and command-line tools and

77
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,590
how they how to clean up all the clutter

78
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:57,120
of the different tools they wrote back

79
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,950
then and do not use binary input formats

80
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,950
and do not insist on interactive input

81
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,750
and also design design and build

82
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,720
software fro if it doesn't work throw it

83
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:09,359
away if it doesn't work well I tried in

84
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:14,310
another way and try to automate as much

85
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:19,200
as possible if if you can oh I got my

86
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:22,500
speaker notes now perfect so in a 1994

87
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,150
Peter solos rephrase this again right

88
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,130
programs that the one thing swell about

89
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,469
programs that work together and what

90
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,140
programs to handle text streams we will

91
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:35,310
find this quite often of course as you

92
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:37,710
all know there's this one new piece of

93
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,110
software that completely follows all

94
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:43,409
these rules and is a lightweight small

95
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,180
simple text based and does one thing

96
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,669
well

97
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,490
not really but we have to live with

98
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:51,109
system D so if you haven't seen my talk

99
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,889
these are the tools I talked about last

100
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:57,289
year t max and set gel I want to point

101
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:58,970
out what once more because they're

102
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:01,400
really awesome if isn't do not like to

103
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:06,320
set she'll try fish or not a more modern

104
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:08,599
she'll rip crap for text searches

105
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,449
progress clearing lists gave me a

106
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,220
shout-out this year thanks for that the

107
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:14,539
recording is online in English and in

108
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,330
German in English from this wonderful

109
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:21,830
conference here an interim chairman from

110
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:23,599
a few events in the CCC area so you will

111
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,870
find it if you want to have a look at

112
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:29,659
that the slides also performed last year

113
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,729
ozone one on my home page so this year

114
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:37,610
this year I'm going to talk about these

115
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:39,349
these few tools they came out of input

116
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:42,410
from other users through Twitter

117
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:44,300
Mastodon and also through a few projects

118
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,400
I had on my table last year you will

119
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,400
probably recognize what I what I spend

120
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,289
my time on last summer so without

121
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,570
further ado modern command-line tools

122
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:56,690
the final last version hopefully I will

123
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:59,300
not do another version next year so

124
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:02,889
please put in talks for next year spark

125
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,930
on so I can move on to other things

126
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:09,740
first tool

127
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:13,940
hop hop is a wrapper for get the braces

128
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:16,220
and expands its functionality it allows

129
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,430
you to do a fork to do pull requests

130
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,349
create the repo cloner repo it has

131
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:26,330
topped up completion and it's quite

132
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:29,090
quite easy and handy to use came out of

133
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,680
- is it why do I have to clone a project

134
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,359
through the web interface when I'm on

135
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,490
the command line there's no need to do

136
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:42,440
that so I found hop um let's see

137
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:46,759
and whip up I can create a new repo

138
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:52,250
let's call it welcome 2019 demo

139
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:54,580
repository and it oh I forgot to delete

140
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,940
it first sorry for that

141
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,520
[Music]

142
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:05,219
created copy it you to the usual first

143
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:07,530
commit and usually you could push it

144
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,509
what you could also do as I already have

145
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,599
it you can create an issue so you can

146
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:14,160
create an issue from the command line

147
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:18,930
stating yeah I got an error for five one

148
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,720
arm in that thingy and of course I

149
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:28,440
forgot the closing quotes so let's try

150
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:30,150
this and now I can do a hub issue and it

151
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:34,050
will show me all the issues I have and

152
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:35,370
with a hub issue show two it will show

153
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,560
me the complete issue that I have

154
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:42,659
without without me having to go into the

155
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:47,789
web interface yes sir on both sides

156
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:49,730
oh that's let me let me see if I can fix

157
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:52,938
this

158
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,939
[Music]

159
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,670
no that's the wrong side

160
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:27,160
thanks for pointing that out all try to

161
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:27,159
get this go away snappy thing seen is it

162
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,590
better now

163
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,569
I'll keep it like that I think that's it

164
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:43,630
should be yep

165
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,040
yes yet that one you have to give the

166
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:50,620
Det projector back

167
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:54,339
it's out of line good so thanks for

168
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:56,410
submitting that issue where is my mouse

169
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,320
because without a mouse I can't continue

170
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:03,579
right so and of course what I should

171
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:10,540
have done is also delete that ripple on

172
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:12,430
the arm on the thing for which was some

173
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,439
obscure reason I do not have admin

174
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:17,790
rights so the Democrats are not with me

175
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:21,880
with with me this time which will be

176
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:34,260
interesting and of course on what should

177
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:34,260
work is that I can power up yeah

178
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:43,689
[Music]

179
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:45,910
what I can do is clone clone clone em

180
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,530
rapper from the so from the source

181
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:53,079
through the command line so that's

182
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:55,050
that's rather nice and easy the same

183
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,860
thing is of course available for kit lab

184
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:05,410
surprisingly cold lab it's a wrapper for

185
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:10,180
for for kit lab and also github that's

186
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:11,680
basically the same thing as top well we

187
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,959
are on the topic of gates there's also

188
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,150
take which is an anchor space text mode

189
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,700
interface for kit you can browse changes

190
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:23,530
you can search for you can do a plain

191
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:27,760
for for changes and can generally do a

192
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:31,089
few nice things with it so you get a

193
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,340
nice a list of all the changes you did

194
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:37,000
in the project if you click on one you

195
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:39,820
get additional information you can go

196
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,370
into TIFF mold you can go into grab more

197
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,740
air can search for stuff and basically

198
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,470
do all the main stuff with a nice

199
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:54,850
command-line interface without going

200
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:56,980
through the big UI right okay Linds well

201
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,950
while we are on the topic of security

202
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,810
and system auditing it's a console based

203
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:07,060
auditing system having compliance

204
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:10,089
testing tool which basically scans scans

205
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,829
your system and gives you gives you

206
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,110
recommendations on how you can could

207
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,580
improve the security and stability of

208
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:19,030
your system

209
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:21,130
it's rather modular and you can write

210
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:25,300
additional modules for it hour or

211
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:27,610
customize it to your needs what it are

212
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,890
it looks like this the output so it gets

213
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:37,450
you you should have a grub bootloader

214
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:40,930
with password and and and other stuff so

215
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:46,870
that's what what then is this nice tool

216
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:48,550
need a little bit of time to run and but

217
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,990
then the output is quite useful it also

218
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:53,359
outputs HTML files so

219
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:56,120
you can print it and give it to a

220
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,980
miniature if you'd want to do that so

221
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,100
what did I spend my last someone

222
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:03,290
basically I had to do I had to find out

223
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,600
why certain things were not working as

224
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:08,270
expected so I spent some time with a lot

225
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,010
of command going tools like top top

226
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,649
lists the current running processes it's

227
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:15,830
this default install on the most Linux

228
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:20,810
systems so it's pretty much everywhere

229
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:23,180
and it's quite useful you can sort you

230
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:27,109
can sort the output through different

231
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:29,329
ways and generally getting an info on

232
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,180
the system there of course are better

233
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:34,070
versions so this for example a top which

234
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,219
is also an esky full screen performance

235
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:40,790
monitor shows you can even show you the

236
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,620
network activity and also does permanent

237
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,120
logging of resource utilization so you

238
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:48,260
can just let it run in the background

239
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,630
for example in a team accession as I'd

240
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:55,100
like to point out and have a log of your

241
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:56,990
performance input over a certain amount

242
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,020
of time to see how they the system

243
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:03,890
behaves again no surprises looks very

244
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:08,360
similar to what we are known from from

245
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:10,339
top 10 there is I've got a CH top it's

246
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,230
an interactive process monitor it's been

247
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:14,329
actively developed since 2004 yes

248
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,510
there's still progress was one of the

249
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:23,270
first top programs to have a tree view

250
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:25,910
and it basically looks like yeah looks

251
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:28,220
like this with f2 you get into the

252
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:33,370
system and you can then check yeah I

253
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:36,170
want additional memory info here I want

254
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:39,170
swap power and memory power move them

255
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:41,870
around you can play around with the

256
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,339
colors with the display options it's

257
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,810
quite a lot of things to do so if you

258
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:48,040
want a nice thing to run in the

259
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:52,790
background or a monitor then H top is

260
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:56,240
quite a nice tool of course we are not

261
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:59,029
only interested in system system values

262
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,860
like disk performance or CPU performance

263
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:03,019
and memory

264
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,220
they're also right most of the time

265
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:06,160
there are applications running on our

266
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,829
servers so there are quite a few

267
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,600
application specific tools one of them

268
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:15,769
of course is Apache top which

269
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,649
surprisingly monitors multiple Apache

270
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:21,230
log files gives you an indication of

271
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:25,360
overall performance and how your threats

272
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:27,920
are behaving or not behaving so again

273
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,759
rather straightforward command-line

274
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,309
interface for Apache top okay Apache top

275
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,670
is of course something for an old fat

276
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:39,379
like me I started off with Apache one

277
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,099
the cool kids on the block of course use

278
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,799
nginx

279
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,230
on therefore of course there's an engine

280
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:48,679
egg stop giving you real-time metrics

281
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:52,249
for nginx server and surprisingly again

282
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:54,920
it looks quite nice actually to be

283
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:59,059
honest you notice it's a little bit more

284
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:01,040
modern than the other and so we talked

285
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:03,069
about one limit of the multiple t

286
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,829
architecture we usually encounter in

287
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:08,389
system administration so let's look at

288
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:10,670
the other one the other one usually says

289
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:14,779
the database of course there is a my top

290
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:18,229
for my sequel or Moriah databases runs

291
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:21,049
on most UNIX systems you need curl and a

292
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:24,559
few perl modules for that but it gets

293
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:26,749
you even color and it will show you the

294
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,809
most interesting thing you want to know

295
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:31,970
about your my sequel server even the

296
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:34,189
query clearly times and stuff like that

297
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,360
of course if you want to use a proper

298
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:37,730
database there of course

299
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,920
peachie top for post crests does the

300
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,649
similar things uses the currently

301
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:46,389
running sequel statements and you can

302
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:50,209
also kill Andrea nice threads

303
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:51,860
Postgres frets so if something is

304
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:56,540
hanging or taking too long you can just

305
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:59,149
give it a kick and let it go away you

306
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:02,389
all been too comfortable Khan we all

307
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:06,169
notice that the power outlet situation

308
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:08,899
in the in the rooms is rather hmm not

309
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:11,119
satisfactory so managing the power in

310
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:13,429
your system is quite important so

311
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:14,600
there's of course power top which will

312
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:16,130
help you with the power

313
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,069
consumption power management of your

314
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:23,389
system usually a laptop this was written

315
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:30,560
by Intel so this is basically for Intel

316
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:32,630
based systems again no power talk why

317
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,839
not there it is

318
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:39,620
it gives you it gives you an overview of

319
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:42,949
your system idle stats so how much time

320
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:45,800
does the CPU is in each of the sea

321
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:48,050
levels so how much power are we going to

322
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,329
see if the hyatt at the sea level the

323
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:53,329
more power you're safe so a cpu that

324
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:54,920
this most of the time in in level cc7 is

325
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:58,729
a good thing because it saves a lot of

326
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:01,819
power of course you can see the

327
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:04,669
gigahertz up going up and down depending

328
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:07,938
on the load on the system to device

329
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:10,069
that's on PEC light and and audio

330
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:15,140
interfaces and the really interesting

331
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:18,470
stuff is the what you can't see

332
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,600
due to the the screen are the

333
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,329
recommendations so this is tool can

334
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,730
actually make will check all the systems

335
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:27,829
and will tell you okay for example the

336
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,080
audio codec power management is

337
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:31,879
currently not enabled so you maybe want

338
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,590
to enable this and it will show you the

339
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,900
command that needs to be done to change

340
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,980
the power setting

341
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,990
unfortunately these settings are not

342
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:42,919
permanent so you have to write write

343
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:45,320
your system D or whatever tool to set

344
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:48,799
this after each reboot but then you will

345
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:53,330
save probably a lot of power so that's

346
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:56,360
power top IO top current IO usage by

347
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:58,820
process of thread of course gives you

348
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,949
disk reads disk writes for each of the

349
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,770
processes you have you can start it with

350
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,480
IO top - only then it will only show

351
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,070
your processes that actually do any

352
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,919
reads and writes and will not clutter

353
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:13,490
your screen with the whole output of

354
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:16,820
this if top is dust for network usage

355
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:19,970
was topped us for CP usage shows you the

356
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:22,280
nice nice information on the network if

357
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,940
this works because it didn't yes it

358
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,010
works now you get a nice view

359
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,640
on the data that's running in and out of

360
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:37,760
your system to each target and you can

361
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:41,480
switch if I remember the hmm where is it

362
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,400
if top there it is the tip of T with the

363
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,100
toggle you can toggle between the fuse

364
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,220
so get one line per host receive traffic

365
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,500
only send traffic only or two lines per

366
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:57,010
host where you can see send and receive

367
00:18:51,500 --> 00:19:03,170
traffic I think it's a very nice tool

368
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:05,420
very convenient very nice yeah that's a

369
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,980
screen shot if you're in the situation

370
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,720
that something on your on your on your

371
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,630
machine on your laptop on your computer

372
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,710
is hogging all the bandwidth and you're

373
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,960
not sure what it is

374
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,850
there's net Hawks for you which group

375
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:22,250
spent with by process and will show you

376
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:24,620
a surprisingly found apart is is taking

377
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:28,280
up all the download bandwidth that's not

378
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:30,080
good in that case then I touched on this

379
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:34,370
in the last year's presentation as well

380
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:36,620
we have to say goodbye to a few tools so

381
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:39,320
net stat is another one of these this

382
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:42,350
will be this will get replaced in all of

383
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:46,340
the major distributions by socket

384
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:50,300
statistics SS as part of the ip-ah ip-ah

385
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:52,879
to package and it will show you our

386
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,490
stats on the packet sockets TCP sockets

387
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,620
raw sockets unique domain sockets and

388
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:02,630
all the other things it can display TCP

389
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:07,520
and state information and it's a lot

390
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:12,140
faster than the old a net stat tool it

391
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:15,560
just I mean we can take a look at it it

392
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:18,130
will show you for example the TCP

393
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,659
sockets we currently have on the system

394
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,730
it's of course if you compare the net

395
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,320
stat if you're into shell golf so if you

396
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,080
find if you're always trying to find the

397
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,939
shortest way to achieve a result SS is

398
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,730
of course a lot short at the net stat so

399
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:35,870
you will gain some benefits in the

400
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:39,590
office shell golf tournament as well if

401
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,870
you want to know the processes to the to

402
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,510
the

403
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:45,779
three of different ports you can do in

404
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:49,440
that stat now SP again I apologize for

405
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:51,120
the rendering that's usually if I if it

406
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,860
turned down if I if I make the font

407
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,799
smaller will reboot can't read anything

408
00:20:52,860 --> 00:21:01,229
at all so it's always a little bit of a

409
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:03,870
trade-off between between those two if

410
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:06,600
you are if you need additional

411
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:09,559
information testy start which allows you

412
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:13,529
to feel you your system resources in a

413
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:16,918
compact way again this is basically

414
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:18,690
running all the time and every time that

415
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,820
the screen is filled it will print the

416
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,190
header again and you can configure this

417
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:26,820
for command line options if you want to

418
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:30,659
see the CPU latency read writes memory

419
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:33,120
disk activity etc also rather nice tool

420
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:35,909
to have running on a screen and see what

421
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:41,399
happens or does not happen on your

422
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:44,159
system decider which is the systems

423
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:46,469
statistics overview I just included it

424
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,860
for completeness sake I don't think it's

425
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:52,340
very nice to look at this discuss which

426
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:56,219
is basically colorized this space usage

427
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:59,270
could replace DF gives you a nice view

428
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:02,429
on where where your data actually goes

429
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:06,110
the thing that I used for most of the

430
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:08,399
time is animal it monitors anything

431
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:11,668
basically anything you want to know and

432
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:13,408
it has a nice data analysis option so

433
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:15,330
you can run this on several machines

434
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:17,399
because most of the applications

435
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,960
nowadays are distributed over several

436
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:23,100
machines several virtual machines

437
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,960
several docker images whatever and then

438
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,939
you have the option to convert to

439
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,559
combine all of these log files and get

440
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:33,120
one coherent overview over all the

441
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,480
activity that has happened on on all the

442
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,029
machines and for the managers there's an

443
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,850
excel file that actually does that so

444
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:49,049
you can get nice graphs and there's also

445
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:50,939
the option to create an HTML output so

446
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:53,250
with an Mon you can say okay I want to

447
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,890
see CPU statistics

448
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,630
if you're not into CPU you can take it

449
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:01,020
away and say I only want to know about

450
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:04,200
memory and swap information or maybe I

451
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:08,309
want do not want memory but I want disk

452
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:10,860
and network information and all of this

453
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:15,418
can then be written out today to the

454
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:21,658
system and be collected together and you

455
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:26,340
get a nice graph in in an ahd HTML file

456
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:28,380
as well as a system summary in Excel

457
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:34,289
where you can send around to management

458
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:37,260
I already covered I already mentioned a

459
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:39,120
docker and so cube tale it's basically a

460
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,520
batch script to tell you Panetta's locks

461
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,799
from multiple pots at the same time if

462
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,870
you using a set shell plug-in manager

463
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:48,059
you can install this as a set shell

464
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:49,799
plug-in if you don't know what I'm

465
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:52,440
talking about watch my last year's talk

466
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:54,020
and it basically gives you a nice

467
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:58,289
colorful

468
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:01,530
output of the log files of the different

469
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:03,330
containers while we're on the topic of

470
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:06,418
colors it's always nice to have log

471
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:08,610
files are colored in different colors so

472
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:10,950
for example warnings in yellow errors in

473
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:13,918
read everything that's okay in a black

474
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:16,110
complex so you don't see it there's

475
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,240
color X which basically takes takes

476
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:20,729
anything and colors it according to a

477
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,159
red X so you can write your own rx2 code

478
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:25,309
make things colorful which will end up

479
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:27,270
in something like this

480
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:28,830
that's overboard and if you have

481
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:32,100
something like this unit using way too

482
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:34,889
much colors if you really into colors I

483
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,709
mean if you really really really into

484
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:41,159
colors there's of course lolcat with

485
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:42,900
rainbows and unicorns and I would ask

486
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,890
you if you have problems with flickering

487
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:49,950
colors or something look away for a

488
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:52,440
second because that's what what's what's

489
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:54,690
rainbow Lovett's what's wrong cat does

490
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,909
it basically covers colors the lock

491
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,950
files in the colors of the rainbow it's

492
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:00,380
very beautiful but not very useful but I

493
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,110
like it

494
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,080
no this gives you a nice or if you've

495
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:11,570
got a proper output it gives you a nice

496
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:13,460
flow so after all these system logging

497
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:16,720
etc there's of course a lot of other

498
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:19,549
tools around that help you with

499
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,150
developing this newfangled modern web

500
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:26,210
stuff so I already talked about HTTP Pi

501
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:29,059
last time this time I want to show you

502
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,620
HTTP prompt which is an interactive HTTP

503
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:35,059
client with Auto completion syntax

504
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:37,280
highlighting based on HTTP PI and really

505
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:39,860
really really nice features like cookie

506
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,960
based authentication so every cookie you

507
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:44,360
get will automatically send in the next

508
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,370
request you get pipelines so you can put

509
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,549
it together with other cool tools like a

510
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:51,620
JQ I showed last time and it also has an

511
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:55,490
opening API swagga integration so you

512
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:57,168
can do a lot of JavaScript stuff if you

513
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,190
can't imagine what it looks like it's

514
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:02,020
rather straightforward

515
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:10,130
um you started with a URL you do a CD

516
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:12,620
post you know city post I said and then

517
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:15,980
I can do authenticate and as you can see

518
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:20,330
it will show you it will show you

519
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:23,120
already a type of hat I can say yes I

520
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,010
want authentication thank you and as you

521
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,928
can see it will also do auto completion

522
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:30,408
so if you have entered something already

523
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:34,039
before it will show it will add that as

524
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:36,710
well and if you do this all in the right

525
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:42,470
order so we get the authorization so we

526
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:46,820
are sending Jason the data you know come

527
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:48,500
on the data is this and then you can say

528
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:52,418
okay what would this look like in each

529
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:55,700
TT PI let's do it this way

530
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:57,799
HTTP PI post so what would the post

531
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,690
request in HTTP PI look like for all

532
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:02,030
this data that would be that you can

533
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:05,650
copy that or you can just see post this

534
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:09,980
and it will post the data it will output

535
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:12,630
the returning data in a nice colorful

536
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,270
and patron a that way

537
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:24,180
if you for example only interested in

538
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:26,010
the username response grep username then

539
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,140
you can of course pop it through crap or

540
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:31,170
another tool and get only the part with

541
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:34,050
the username so very nice tool very

542
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:36,650
handy if you are into the HTTP

543
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:41,040
development thingy

544
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:44,370
last year I presented takeyou which was

545
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,470
basically Swiss Army knife for chastened

546
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:49,080
data of course there is something for

547
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:52,500
the enterprise chasing community there's

548
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,750
exam XML solid so XML solid lets you

549
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,420
transform query validate basically

550
00:27:54,750 --> 00:28:00,510
mangle XML in any way you want from the

551
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:03,740
command line it does everything you

552
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:07,170
would expect it to do and for example

553
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:09,000
you can say XML solid LS and it will

554
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:11,850
give you the current directory as an XML

555
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,040
file okay we can argue about that the

556
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,350
the use of the usability and the

557
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,320
usefulness of that but then you can of

558
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:23,879
course write X LST to say okay I want

559
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:25,530
the directory listing without attributes

560
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,810
without the e and then without the

561
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:32,129
access a trip without the attributes and

562
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:35,100
then you can get this but of course this

563
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:37,550
is not limited to the XML of output of a

564
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,260
directory which is just a nice tool to

565
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:43,860
show what it can do you can actually

566
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:47,730
grab the schedule of Falcone as an XML

567
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:51,120
file and then for example search a grep

568
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:53,040
or grab a transform all the conference

569
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,370
titles out of it and do something else

570
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,170
with it so that's that's a nice tool if

571
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:03,270
you have to work with XML from the

572
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:06,360
command line my favorite this year is

573
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:09,060
ultimate lumber if you're working with

574
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:12,719
command-line tools like rap and orc and

575
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:15,810
and and stuff like that a word count and

576
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,690
paste it's always trial and error so you

577
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:20,399
you can connect several several tools

578
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,560
together through the pipe command and

579
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,240
then you hope that it works and if it

580
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,580
doesn't work you have to edit again and

581
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:31,010
then run it again and

582
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:34,790
it's a cycle with ultimate plum bow or

583
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:37,430
up it's a lot easier so which network

584
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:40,879
cuts do I have in my laptop for example

585
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:43,220
so I get a list of all the hardware in

586
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,290
my laptop and now I want to find the

587
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:50,060
network the network cut so I can do a

588
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:54,200
grep net okay let's say let's do it

589
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:56,710
grep network I need more output so give

590
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,470
me give me the first five lines of each

591
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:02,660
match of crap okay that's that's a lot

592
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,830
better part I actually only need the

593
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,430
first two lines

594
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:11,870
thank you that's that's even better then

595
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:15,710
I would grab for the colon which gets me

596
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:19,729
a lot further and now I can cut this up

597
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:24,440
to get a nice output minus D on a colon

598
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:28,010
and minus F I want second one and put

599
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:32,240
that paste - - with a blank in between

600
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:34,070
and I get a nice a nice output of my

601
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,200
network card this is of course just an

602
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:39,280
example but this is a really useful tool

603
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,110
to interactively put together a long

604
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:46,580
UNIX command like it should be and like

605
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:49,250
like the like you want to do it right so

606
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:55,120
that's the plumber' oh and fastest I'm

607
00:30:49,250 --> 00:31:00,500
sorry for that then we have wrapped here

608
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:04,669
Reptar Reptar hello computer thank you

609
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:06,110
it's it repeats you eyes programs if

610
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:09,230
you're asking yourself what do I mean by

611
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:11,840
that I'm imagine you have an SSH session

612
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,550
to one of your servers and on that

613
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,740
server you started to download for a

614
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:17,990
double you get oral download that runs

615
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:21,470
for a very long time and you forgot to

616
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:24,020
use teamworks as I explained last time

617
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:26,300
on the server so if you close down the

618
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,370
SSH session the download will stop of

619
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,680
course so what you want to do is open

620
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:33,320
another window start a team work session

621
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,660
in there and then somehow transfer that

622
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,230
download over to that other to that

623
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:44,950
other session and that's exactly what

624
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:48,970
a repeat er is for let me but let me

625
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:53,350
show it's always easier to show so I do

626
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:55,270
have in one window my W ket which I

627
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,820
start and which will run oh it's

628
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,740
actually quite fast I'm surprised so

629
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,750
this is running in this window and of

630
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,330
course in another window on the same

631
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:08,550
machine arm if I take a look at it

632
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:14,889
there's my process go back still running

633
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:21,460
now I can do a re P Tyr and use the

634
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:23,830
process ID of my W cat and now my W get

635
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:27,520
runs in this window and if I switch back

636
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:29,770
to the other one it's it's gone I can

637
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,020
close this session and move on to to pet

638
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:34,660
of things so that's what repeat ER does

639
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:37,180
are rather handy if you forget to start

640
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:44,130
MT max or if you musta screen session

641
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:49,350
and re reparent progress applications

642
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:51,940
yeah what I'm not showing life is ttyd

643
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:53,770
which allows you to share your terminal

644
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:58,210
over the web so it's basically a

645
00:32:53,770 --> 00:33:00,520
command-line tool to verify your your

646
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:06,460
terminal window I only have a screenshot

647
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:08,080
for reasons which is here so in the in

648
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:13,090
the bottom you will see a you see I

649
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:16,540
started ttyd with on on port 8081 and i

650
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:18,280
started as set shell in there and on the

651
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,870
top you will see that i connected to

652
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,820
them to the machine in this case is

653
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:25,139
localhost was of course this will work

654
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:29,230
over any network as long as it's TCP and

655
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,880
in that session I started H top as a

656
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,110
demonstration tool you have an intact if

657
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,560
shell in there you can plug you can

658
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:41,290
start commands everything but you don't

659
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:43,750
have any authentication so as this is a

660
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:47,470
machine I'm trying to use several times

661
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:53,169
I'm not opening this up here

662
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:55,509
just then there's WTF which is a

663
00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:58,450
personal information dashboard so if

664
00:33:55,509 --> 00:34:02,019
you're a pimp a pimp freak that wants to

665
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:04,870
see a lot of information at the same

666
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:07,230
time this is completely configurable you

667
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:09,848
can include you can integrate that with

668
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:12,940
with a lot of development tools Google

669
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:14,230
Calendar and and stuff like that so if

670
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,240
you if you want to build your own

671
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:23,649
dashboard on the on the console

672
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:27,009
WTF will will have you covered and we

673
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:29,589
are almost finished last tool in the

674
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:31,480
case that the local TV studio comes by

675
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:34,719
and you need something visual and they

676
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,460
need some pyrrole or whatever there's

677
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,500
this no more secrets to which is really

678
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:42,129
nice and if you're into old a hacker

679
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,899
movies you will recognize this so what

680
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:49,899
it does let me just stop the download

681
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:52,210
here it will you can pipe something to

682
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:55,949
it for example so if I do an LS and pipe

683
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:59,530
it for no more secrets it will it will

684
00:34:55,949 --> 00:35:03,569
encrypt the data and if you press the

685
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:06,250
button it will in a very nice visual way

686
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:09,940
decrypt the data so you can actually see

687
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:12,190
this so if a TV crew is looking for for

688
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:14,530
for visual effects that's what you want

689
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:16,440
to do who remembers which movie that is

690
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:19,510
shut it out

691
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,560
sneakers exactly awesome movie I do love

692
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:23,829
it

693
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,980
there's also theme I think there's also

694
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:33,250
the the original animation on in there

695
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:37,319
so yeah brah I mean no come find it now

696
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,319
so that's basically it

697
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:43,050
that's that's my website that the slides

698
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,900

699
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:48,940

please do not send them to me on Twitter

701

00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,759
more stuff

705
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:02,799

number one thank you for ultimate

713
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:27,819
plumber' mmm that looks amazing so one

714
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:30,250
thing I'd like to add is the ttyd or

715
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:32,650
what's it called it's a bit more work

716
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:35,980
but you can use a you know a VPS or have

717
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:38,380
your ports forwarded do a reverse port

718
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:41,140
forward on your SSH session open Tmax

719
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:43,359
and anybody can join on your session

720
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,859
interactively it's useful and more

721
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,509
secure since you can do as a sate

722
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:52,869
authentication yeah so questions

723
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:56,470
comments additional tools that he won't

724
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:59,140
review what I'm looking for if any idea

725
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:02,019
on how to mirror I do have a setup to

726
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:03,788
mirror text sessions or console sessions

727
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:06,098
with tea mugs fruity mugs so I can type

728
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:08,380
here look at my screen and have a second

729
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:10,480
screen on the beam under on a projector

730
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:13,480
I'm looking for something similar for

731
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,789
for we based programs like a browser so

732
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,880
yeah so I can have two browsers showing

733
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:21,490
the same session and if I if I click in

734
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,980
one in one browser the other shows the

735
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,240
same action so if you know of something

736
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:29,440
like that I would be really really

737
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:36,339
interested in otherwise I'll take any

738
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:38,829
comments positive negative and if not we

739
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:41,090
can say you have a few a few minutes for

740
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:45,860
drinks

741
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:48,770
hey thanks for the talk and if anyone is

742
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:51,920
working with docker there is a lazy

743
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:54,680
docker tool and that helps you a lot

744
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,770
with showing the logs for all all the

745
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:01,279
containers on the server or local

746
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:03,250
machine or whatever so maybe they should

747
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:08,900
change the name lazy and talker is

748
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:10,880
redundant myself also dive to get the

749
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,610
image in layers and see what the changes

750
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,430
are it is really helpful for debugging

751
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:19,070
issues with the build yeah as I said

752
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:21,109
