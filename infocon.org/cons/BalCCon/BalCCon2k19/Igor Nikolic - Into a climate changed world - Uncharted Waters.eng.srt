1
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:34,739
okay so welcome all thanks for coming

2
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:38,040
it's the famous day after day after the

3
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,989
night before yeah there is some

4
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,080
scattered painful laughter everybody's

5
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:47,010
nervous in deliver thanks for being here

6
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:50,730
I try to do a tldr try to be a smartass

7
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,379
I hope it sort of gives you a nerdy gist

8
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,629
of what we are going to try to do today

9
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,479
okay

10
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:59,790
so into climate change world the

11
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,710
uncharted waters why not so my name is

12
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,140
Igor Nicholas I'm associate professor in

13
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,840
Delft University of Delft I'm also just

14
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:12,290
a huge nerd like all of us here

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm engineer triumph of the world right

16
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,330
as you all know and I will show you it

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,570
world needs

18
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,070
desperate on I'm a hacker a trap

19
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,750
space in The Hague we play with fire

20
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,190
with steel with electrons and bytes in

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,070
microbes and light and all sorts of

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,560
stuff a proud member of the Balkan lots

23
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,100
of present team whoo you've seen all of

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,799
it I teach I study I tell stories

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,679
organize things I am I want to be artist

26
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,109
I feel and I'm a dad which is also

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:45,149
important so that's kind of where I'm

28
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:47,158
coming from and I will try oh yeah

29
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,530
before we go down there is a manual this

30
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,469
talk I don't really know what the hell

31
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,179
I'm talking about okay there is going to

32
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:56,280
be a lot of science that I know is good

33
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:57,780
there's a lot of stuff that I'm like I

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,310
don't know I'm trying to think this

35
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,200
through okay so this is an attempt to

36
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,909
really think about some very annoying

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,960
unpleasant and complicated things and

38
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,119
see if you can have a meaningful

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,459
conversation about where the world is

40
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,840
going to feel free to ask questions you

41
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:17,540
know clarify discussion please keep them

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,370
for later because otherwise we will I

43
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,280
will touch on basically every part of

44
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,780
life and the economy and the planet so

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,420
we can't really ever discuss this to the

46
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,980
final I get carried away right the

47
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,829
bitrate might go up I have had my

48
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,950
caffeine so I'm up and running and I

49
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,720
might fall into jargon which is my bad

50
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,780
do waive the slow

51
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,270
me down okay please that helps me to

52
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,790
land probably the most depressing talk

53
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,670
of the whole conference so if you want

54
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,340
to leave now is your time okay so

55
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,230
without further ado what are we going to

56
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,740
do today so follow me things I'm going

57
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,329
to do a bit of science the stuff that

58
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,810
why did I say science because this is

59
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,910
the stuff that we know to be true okay

60
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,470
means I will not go into all the

61
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,790
evidence I will not go into all the

62
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,580
details because then we will talk the

63
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,350
next two years but until the end science

64
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,300
this will be stuff that I am convinced

65
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,459
is fine then the design which is

66
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,160
normative and I believe to be right and

67
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:21,090
then there is the bit of hope on the end

68
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,340
I hope okay so context and a bit of

69
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,020
theory we need this bit of theory so

70
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,760
that we can understand why this is a

71
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:33,930
problem we are dealing with climate

72
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,810
change with the unsustainability crisis

73
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,360
about the world is about to hit is

74
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,220
hitting has had a fairly nasty point in

75
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,410
time you will see in a minute bit more

76
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,150
detail it's important to realize that

77
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,570
this so that the scientific name for

78
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,060
these things is the wicked problems

79
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:52,560
definition there is definition burrito

80
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,510
the thing with vigor problems like

81
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,060
climate change legislative ility is that

82
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,220
there is no one correct problem

83
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,350
definition they never can be one correct

84
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,830
oh it's all about the money it's all

85
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:06,950
about the pandas scoop on us it's all

86
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,150
about the economy it's all about

87
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,410
security no it's about all of that and

88
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,260
none of that okay

89
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:16,709
it's impossible to measure or claim

90
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,969
success in any wicked problem when can

91
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,940
we say that we have solved the

92
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:23,690
sustainability crisis only thing we know

93
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,910
is that we are not solving it when we're

94
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,229
you know finishing civilization so you

95
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,780
can't really know when you're doing it

96
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:32,940
right the the solutions cannot only be

97
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,280
good or bad there they never true or

98
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,350
false there all of that there is no

99
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,739
final perfect state if you're

100
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,740
engineering a bridge and the mechanical

101
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,289
engineers your civil engineers yeah

102
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,910
right you have a finite clearly finish

103
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:48,740
the bridge stands the bridge does not

104
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,930
stand it's buying

105
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,630
you can do the math you find a solution

106
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:59,060
you optimize it solve it what is a good

107
00:04:53,630 --> 00:05:01,430
society that's fair that is not a thing

108
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,500
you can measure that way no templates

109
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,350
right all of this we are making this up

110
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,980
as a civilization as we go along we are

111
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,600
trying to just as a species survive and

112
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,910
you know there's many multiple

113
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,860
explanations why does why do we have

114
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,560
these co2 emissions why are we unable to

115
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,480
stop them well it's the capitalists no

116
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,500
is the environmentalist no is the damn

117
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,300
pandas it's what all of it yeah every

118
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,270
problem is a symptom because it's all

119
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,580
connected there is no objective solution

120
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:35,659
there is no simple scientific truth only

121
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:37,640
bits of pieces we can prove and every

122
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,860
solution is a one-shot solution right so

123
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,810
this is interesting when you design in

124
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,180
an engineering closed problem you can

125
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,670
say ok aha design patterns I've seen

126
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,960
this problem before all right so I

127
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,370
talked to trammel yesterday is that oh

128
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,739
my god how on earth can you fix this

129
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,480
laser interface within half an hour but

130
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,490
I played the lasers before this thing is

131
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,350
different but very similar I can use the

132
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,540
same approach to it and so I think get

133
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,580
very far very quickly also when you're

134
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,050
dealing with climate change you have no

135
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,849
idea what's going to happen and as you

136
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,220
are fixing it you're changing the

137
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,050
problem so you're always running behind

138
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,050
the facts oh that's a wicked problem and

139
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,870
the final one we cannot afford to be

140
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,520
wrong right the biggest problem with the

141
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,820
smaller scale managing a city or

142
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:26,180
something you get fired right here you

143
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:27,170
mess up you go extinct yeah yeah right

144
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,020
so that's not awesome

145
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:32,450
so you can't afford to be wrong and yet

146
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,510
it's vital so ok that's that's the

147
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:37,159
wicked problems the other thing we must

148
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:40,310
understand is the notion of chaos and

149
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,930
chaotic systems so chaos is not a lack

150
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,450
of order right that's the colloquial

151
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,480
word oh it's chaos in this room no chaos

152
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,190
is our systems that are iterative right

153
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,840
so there's the keep on happening over

154
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:54,170
and over they depend on the previous

155
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,530
state right and they have extreme

156
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:59,810
sensitivity to initial conditions and

157
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:02,479
they have these stable states for the

158
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,030
tractors they have structure right so

159
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,930
the the

160
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,669
think there's the Lorenz attractor

161
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,650
that's this what came out of studying

162
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:10,170
weather for the first time and here is

163
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,210
an example of the wolf sheep predation

164
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:15,990
model so I have that here this is a

165
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:17,489
simulation an agent-based model and I

166
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,350
just want to play a little bit with it

167
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,110
to show you so this is a world where

168
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,610
there is wolves and sheep right so what

169
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,740
do sheep do they run around eat grass

170
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,760
make more sheep what the wolves do they

171
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:32,490
run around eat sheep make more walls so

172
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,400
I can now go into Lion King

173
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,770
Hakuna Matata the circus of life in the

174
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,090
model okay so what happens when the

175
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:43,380
circle of life is started in this

176
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:47,909
digital world no go watch the population

177
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:52,500
their little graph Hey oh what

178
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:58,410
happened it's awesome if you grass

179
00:07:52,500 --> 00:08:00,000
otherwise it sucks right okay so okay

180
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,860
let's reduce the number of sheep maybe

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,630
we have too much sheep okay so sheep are

182
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:08,310
no good setup

183
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:15,960
let's do less sheep what happens then so

184
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:19,620
red line is the Sheep okay and it's

185
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,780
cheap world okay so I have just slightly

186
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,090
changed the number of initial sheep and

187
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:27,330
now it says Oh sheep have inherited the

188
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:29,460
earth this who made the model has a

189
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,890
sense of humor I can hold this okay so

190
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,919
that's sure now let's do this let's add

191
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:37,260
grass so coming from Holland that's a

192
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,299
weird comment but okay so now I have

193
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,140
changed the world and I have said there

194
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:44,819
is grass that grows at a certain rate

195
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,980
sheep run around eat grass make more

196
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,690
sheep wolf run around each sheep make

197
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,430
more wolves and grass keeps on going

198
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,340
because the almighty Sun provides energy

199
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:56,069
okay the same numbers I need to actually

200
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:59,730
let me just reload all the way back to

201
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,949
set up the huevos you know set up and

202
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,279
set up and then go so what happens then

203
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:06,389
so I've made the system more complex

204
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:09,509
right not more complicated I'd have

205
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:11,389
added one extra layer of interaction and

206
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:13,859
what do we have

207
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:16,499
wait I just realized you can only see

208
00:09:13,859 --> 00:09:21,629
half of this there we go

209
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:24,089
is that better yeah and now we are in

210
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:26,639
what's called a no dynamic equilibrium a

211
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:29,069
stable dynamic equilibrium so yes we are

212
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,439
dynamic we're moving but we are going

213
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:33,738
through ok fine so what happens if I

214
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:36,389
then let's say change the regrowth time

215
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:39,689
so what I've added now only I need to

216
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:45,230
reduce its rate so I made the grass grow

217
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:45,230
faster is there a difference

218
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:56,529
okay so keep this in mind someone

219
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,719
something is going on okay so this slide

220
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:02,020
so what I'm doing here is I'm running

221
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,850
that same model over time the three axis

222
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,089
is an amount of grass wolves and sheep

223
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,160
and I'm plotting the system trajectory

224
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:12,600
so I'm plotting the state of the system

225
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:15,310
in this 3d space and I am constantly

226
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,890
increasing the amount of energy in the

227
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:20,619
system and the regrowth time of grass is

228
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:23,290
going down right so the quicker and

229
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,760
quicker grass comes back so what happens

230
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,589
you've seen the dynamic equilibrium but

231
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,529
it's oscillating around this state that

232
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:32,800
we would call normal work sheep grass

233
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:36,060
it's all fine but it's oscillating more

234
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,060
and more intensely

235
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,990
okay so whoa okay it's still kind of

236
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,490
functional it's still kind of there in

237
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:48,640
that area and then something happens

238
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,240
right this is an awesome sheep world go

239
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,270
for dead

240
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,180
there's only sheep not again that's an

241
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:57,819
awesome thing if your sheep but not if

242
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,069
your wolf so what happened right there

243
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,709
is what's called an attractor change so

244
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,950
there is a system state that the system

245
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:07,270
wants to be in when certain history has

246
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,040
happened and certain values of

247
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,110
parameters have happened now this is

248
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,650
literally what we are doing to the

249
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,360
planet right so we're not making the the

250
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:19,180
grass grow faster we are making the

251
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,480
temperature of the atmosphere go higher

252
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,920
you don't have to do a lot you only have

253
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,410
to do two or three degrees but that's

254
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,540
enough to tip a chaotic system because

255
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:31,360
the climate is a chaotic system to tip

256
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:35,020
it from one state one attractor into a

257
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,910
different attractor why I'm going into

258
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,069
this so if so much detail because people

259
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,439
say oh but what does adding five percent

260
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,209
of co2 mean that's just that's

261
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,740
five percent more no that's not five

262
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:47,529
percent more that is that is ten million

263
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,730
times worse because it's a nonlinear

264
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:53,350
chaotic system flipping between

265
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:55,330
attractors okay make sense so keep this

266
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,280
in mind right so we are not dealing with

267
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,290
linear things normal linear thinking

268
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,100
just does not work is the wrong mental

269
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,050
model

270
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,249
this thing there's these three words are

271
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,498
very important we talk about

272
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:08,569
sustainability about climate change is

273
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:11,589
robustness versus resilience versus

274
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:14,180
adaptivity they're not the same thing

275
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:15,860
so first when somebody says oh you've

276
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,019
built a resilient system right when you

277
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:21,379
do IT systems right resilient or maybe

278
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:22,850
the robust system - what have you made

279
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:24,709
system resilient to absolute power

280
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,329
failure - the next three years no you

281
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:28,969
made it maybe resilient for half an hour

282
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:32,769
low power or you may be resilient in

283
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,769
this case I can recover from something

284
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:41,719
robust means I can with standard a dike

285
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:43,819
a huge tree concrete is robust I can

286
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,920
hold hold hold and then I feel

287
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:48,410
catastrophically when I cannot hold any

288
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,269
more resilient I flip-flop it everything

289
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:53,420
and maybe I can come back where I came

290
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:55,069
from adaptive is learning how to have

291
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,740
fun with the situation it's going along

292
00:12:55,069 --> 00:13:01,009
and changing who you are because of

293
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:04,160
what's going on right and most companies

294
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:06,860
are either robust resilient very few are

295
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,629
adaptive societies have trouble with

296
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,980
adaptation as well because what we've

297
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:11,360
been doing this for the past three

298
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,329
centuries it's great

299
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,069
that's how for right turns out to be a

300
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:19,189
racist or whatever but hey we always

301
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:20,750
done that and yeah ok so keep this in

302
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:25,939
mind as we talk further

303
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:28,309
so more science state of the world this

304
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:29,779
guy Ben see a climate Ben I recommend

305
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:33,680
following him if you meet your daily

306
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:36,170
dose of depression basically this is the

307
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,719
TLDR of where the world is now I for

308
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:41,000
every of these points I can open several

309
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,100
academic journals find literally

310
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,750
hundreds of publications it'll be a very

311
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,429
boring talk but as far as I know

312
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,399
studying sustainability past 20 years

313
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:51,250
everything he says here is true we have

314
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,870
scientific evidence for all of this

315
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,879
oceans are dying we know that right the

316
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,040
acidity is going up biodiversity is

317
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:58,990
going down coral is dying vida filling

318
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,769
it the trash okay

319
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:06,350
forests may we've seen Amazon map

320
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:08,120
fertile soil now gonna lose a lot of it

321
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,779
very soon megafauna

322
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,370
all the big beasts gonna be gone soon

323
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:14,559
insects

324
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,470
have disappeared are disappearing

325
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,990
there's a this is this is where that's

326
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,430
where I stopped sleeping at night German

327
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,559
study they studied for 10 years in

328
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,719
Europe they measured a 70 percent

329
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:27,430
decline in sex maybe you noticed you

330
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,829
drive around the summer you never have

331
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,540
to clean your windshield anymore there's

332
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:32,800
just nothing to smash against it that's

333
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:37,779
pretty awesome I don't have to clean my

334
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:40,599
car the moment insects go humans go is

335
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:42,399
that simple climate chaos because of the

336
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,309
couple socio-technical nama cool thing

337
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,990
is going to happen stuff is going

338
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:48,639
extinct things are dying faster than

339
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,579
ever right it's Anthropocene we are

340
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,990
worse than the freaking meteorite we are

341
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:54,209
killing things faster the meteorites

342
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,470
have done in the past

343
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:57,819
plastic is littering your blood right we

344
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,129
eat plastics we breathe it it's

345
00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:01,990
everywhere it's doing fun things because

346
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:03,550
it's absorbing all sorts of nasty

347
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:07,180
chemicals that not being carried to

348
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:10,329
their brains it's great and we don't

349
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:12,248
talk about it because I don't know it's

350
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:15,699
much more important with yellow monkeys

351
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:19,019
in power somewhere yeah now the problem

352
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:21,219
with these things is as science works in

353
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,360
negative proofs right you can never

354
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,809
prove something is true you can only

355
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,910
prove something is not true so we know

356
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:30,790
that this is we can prove that this is

357
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,709
not going to not not happen that that

358
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:35,050
sounds weird right but we don't know

359
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:36,670
exactly when we don't know exactly how

360
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,248
because the chaotic system again

361
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,050
remember we are in that wolf sheep thing

362
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:42,959
doing our daily life it still seems to

363
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:45,069
be pretty normal we're going in circles

364
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,899
sometimes we get this weird weather it's

365
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:49,120
a little bit more rain but yeah okay

366
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:51,790
oh wait suddenly hurricanes Avalos okay

367
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,980
oh wait now we have the storm we've

368
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:55,480
never had before here okay oh wait now

369
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,920
we had two more storms that he's never

370
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,649
had before last week

371
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,179
oh wait so we flip-flopping is going

372
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:03,279
crazy and crazy oh we still in what at

373
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:04,749
what attractor we when are we gonna flip

374
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,449
into something different we don't know

375
00:16:04,749 --> 00:16:09,579
you cannot predict in advance you will

376
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:11,378
know when you're there but you won't do

377
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:14,469
in advance and so when how exactly how

378
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:16,089
bad is uncertain and not just to certain

379
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,679
it's deeply uncertain that's it another

380
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:19,569
technical term when you know that you

381
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,679
don't know you know you don't know

382
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:21,849
what's the right model you don't know

383
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,569
which parameters are true you don't know

384
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,310
you which question is true

385
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:30,080
but you know something's going on so

386
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:31,760
that's basically where we are no we

387
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:35,210
can't really fix it now and this is the

388
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,340
shitty part okay why because it's very

389
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,800
hard to realize something is going on we

390
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,830
are talking about next 52 next hundred

391
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,240
years maybe the next 30 years we start

392
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,980
we least you know where people start

393
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,240
dropping dead because of climate I mean

394
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,010
that's already happening but not quite

395
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:54,260
here yet so you know when a member of

396
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:57,350
the US Congress goes into a Congress

397
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:59,920
session holds a snowball it says there

398
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,390
is no climate change look it just snowed

399
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,520
well there is no road hunger I just had

400
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,230
booted this morning nobody in the world

401
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,290
is hungry because I had borax so clearly

402
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,839
there is food right so I don't see the

403
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:15,740
problem

404
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:17,810
okay main main problem as I see it we

405
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,490
cannot get it organized technically yes

406
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:22,129
if you want a sustainable world tomorrow

407
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:25,160
we do have technology we have the energy

408
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,150
generation capacity we can do 80 90

409
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,870
percent of what needs to be done

410
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:31,610
tomorrow except you can't because of

411
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,879
technical delays and mainly because of

412
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:38,510
organizational social issues power

413
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,830
doesn't want to change right I could

414
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,850
have shown you lots of graphs about

415
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:47,120
power distribution in the world of

416
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:50,689
0.0001% owning 50% of their in the UK

417
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,050
you can put half the money in UK in a

418
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:56,930
small bus right we're talking 30 people

419
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:59,690
that own half UK globally they fit maybe

420
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:02,390
three buses and you have half the

421
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,970
world's money literally like 5000 50

422
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:07,490
people just think about that right it's

423
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,050
what does that mean for growth is going

424
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,760
to be different we need to change maybe

425
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,350
you cannot be that rich anymore maybe

426
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,730
you need to start spending money not on

427
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,939
a third yucks button actually

428
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:18,950
infrastructure for Starfucker

429
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,430
so powers are there they're not going to

430
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,780
change

431
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,780
I mean would you if you were there

432
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,860
lots of preventing interest are we going

433
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,928
to do the Chinese way we will do it

434
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,969
european way we will do it whoever I

435
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:32,760
don't know everybody and inertia path

436
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:34,980
dependency oh but that's just change to

437
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,658
distributed systems for energy sure and

438
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,250
then neglect one hundred thousand

439
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:39,779
kilometers of cables dug up into the

440
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,890
ground that have cost trillions of

441
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:42,840
dollars and we've been built over the

442
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,000
last hundred years you can't just change

443
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,459
it right I could have put nice beams

444
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,470
here but not the one does not just into

445
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,450
Mordor change more than infrastructure

446
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,000
you don't just change it you have to

447
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,350
draw into these things have time when I

448
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,110
talk to my friends and colleagues from

449
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:01,620
the National Grid operator in Holland oh

450
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:05,100
we just add a 380 kilowatt line here and

451
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,260
they laugh well first we have seven

452
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,389
years of permits before we get the

453
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,309
permit to build it then I need to find

454
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:13,710
enough people and be able to buy enough

455
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:15,690
copper to actually start building and

456
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,760
then I'm building for three years so

457
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:20,820
adding a single electrical line takes

458
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,190
ten years right and now we have to

459
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:26,850
completely rebuild our infrastructure no

460
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:28,919
we know how to do it but so path

461
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:33,120
dependency inertia we are basically in

462
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:35,610
the path globally into a very ugly place

463
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,709
but you don't see it now weather is

464
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:40,918
awesome there's beer and math we just

465
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,740
touch evapo it's great and that is so

466
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,779
hard to fathom as you know you

467
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:47,850
fundamentally fact and you can't really

468
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:50,880
do anything about it and you want

469
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,529
numbers this this is it yeah that takes

470
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,760
a few seconds to load just look at this

471
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:55,760
it's just just temperatures

472
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,190
[Music]

473
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:07,270
right last what seventh years

474
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:11,000
no more hundred seventh years whoops

475
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:12,370
right remember that image I showed you

476
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:19,450
about the wolfson ship that looks

477
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:21,770
scarily similar okay and we know yeah

478
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,200
historic context people say oh but it

479
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:27,050
has been warm in the past No

480
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,880
so first no that's not true and second

481
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:31,700
fine but we did not have a highly

482
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,900
industrious globalized human society 70

483
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,240
million years ago so I don't give a

484
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,550
rat's ass it was warm them

485
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,020
it's not it's warm now and the speed but

486
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:41,480
you understand derivatives right we all

487
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,490
nerds here the derivatives is almost

488
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,429
infinite

489
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:48,320
so this xkd cartoon xkd is brilliant as

490
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:49,760
you all know he said okay I'm gonna put

491
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,590
this into perspective so here is the

492
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,200
last I don't know several million years

493
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:57,100
on the scale right it takes 10 minutes

494
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,270
to scroll through this image and

495
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,149
basically if you look at historical

496
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:04,250
temperatures there

497
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:08,570
that's about as the hottest it has ever

498
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:11,410
been okay and that's what we're doing

499
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:13,790
right now so it's a complete

500
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:18,470
non-linearity right we all know rising

501
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:20,720
edges on an analogue but binary data so

502
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:23,690
the rising edge is wonderful right if

503
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,890
you're writing code - you know FPGAs to

504
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,090
recognize the rising edge you have a

505
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,320
beautiful rising edge it's like

506
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:32,449
non-linearity pulse and that's humanity

507
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,270
right 200 years ago we had nothing to

508
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:37,309
admit there was no industrial society we

509
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,840
have emitted last five years of first

510
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:41,210
ten years more than we have ever made it

511
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,678
before in throughout human history just

512
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,140
to give you a sense of the exponential

513
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:48,460
curves and there is no way we're

514
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,460
stopping anytime soon

515
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:54,429
and if you continue doing the math and

516
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:58,179
as a scientist that's your job we are

517
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:59,740
hitting likely to hit 700 to 900 ppm co2

518
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:01,600
and not even putting the methane there

519
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,940
because methane really things up

520
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,129
over right methane from rotting on the

521
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:09,880
Tundra's and stuff so we're going to hit

522
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:13,330
Yosi machine has been around about 50

523
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:15,670
plus million years ago this is where the

524
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:19,000
sea was full of like huge snails and

525
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:21,120
stuff right and that's the time that

526
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,350
they were forests in the South Pole and

527
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,709
forests on the North Pole it was like

528
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,959
tropical island everywhere right which

529
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,929
is awesome except them we don't have

530
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,429
northeastern Europe anymore because no

531
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:35,500
civilization on the ten meters of sea

532
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:37,780
that's pretty awesome

533
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,610
so that's where's my pointer so you can

534
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,230
see that right so there is northwest

535
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:45,040
Europe basically 80 percent of Europe's

536
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:47,260
economy that's there oh that is about

537
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,010
the billion people that's another half a

538
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,900
billion people

539
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,570
oh wait Indonesia almost a billion

540
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,950
people we're no just few islands China

541
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:59,290
that's basically where most of the

542
00:22:53,950 --> 00:23:00,640
Chinese people lives gone okay this is

543
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,899
gonna take a while this is one happened

544
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,360
tomorrow this might happen in one

545
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,670
hundred hundred fifty years maybe maybe

546
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:10,000
earlier we don't know if you read the

547
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:12,850
academic journals it's basically forget

548
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,700
about North Pole north pole is gone not

549
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:18,699
now not in five years maybe fifteen

550
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:22,360
twenty assume there will be zero ice

551
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,620
there not a 30 South will be probably be

552
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,469
gone we don't know but that's the

553
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,020
trajectories looked like that's it

554
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,520
it takes co2 forty years to get into the

555
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,860
into higher atmosphere so we are

556
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,710
experiencing emissions impacts of

557
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:39,100
emissions forty years ago just let that

558
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:41,679
sink in right so we still have 40 years

559
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,209
of to catch up on us and we

560
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,530
keep on increasing the emissions be

561
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:49,920
having because there's so much money to

562
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,920
be made so yeah this is the endgame

563
00:23:50,910 --> 00:24:01,680
so by property switzerland friend domo

564
00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:04,890
hey yes okay so what does this then mean

565
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,570
okay again I would go I could go

566
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:08,040
literally to hundreds of publications to

567
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,990
show you all the studies that were done

568
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,730
about scenarios and possible impacts I

569
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:14,130
will not do that I have just reduced it

570
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:17,220
into quick and short things just to

571
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:18,840
point them out in all of these things we

572
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,580
have the knowns we know something is

573
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,870
changing we know the known unknowns we

574
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,280
don't know how bad this is going to

575
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:26,610
change and there is a whole bunch of

576
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:29,430
unknown unknowns right the famous room

577
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:31,169
salt saying we know there are things

578
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:34,500
that will happen that we just can't even

579
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:36,330
imagine yet and there's a we need to

580
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,130
think about short-term and sudden things

581
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,169
like hurricanes and there is a systemic

582
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,020
slow effects that you don't see suddenly

583
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:46,530
but happen over decades or centuries

584
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:50,129
right also keep in mind that geologists

585
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:51,690
have done the math and once the climate

586
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,730
has changed as we expected to change it

587
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:57,420
would take between thousand and ten

588
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:59,250
thousand years for it to recover right

589
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,090
this is not like oh we messed up you

590
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,850
spill on the ground

591
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,980
or have a mess I clean up I'm good right

592
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,639
climate has already been changed forever

593
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:10,320
as long as human civilization exists

594
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,460
that's how long we will have to live

595
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,169
with the we have caused right

596
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:20,250
that keeps me literally awake at night

597
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:23,210
so that that's it right we don't fall in

598
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,650
that's and so what's going to happen

599
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,850
much more frequent and much more extreme

600
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,170
weather we know that already

601
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:31,110
right they're seeing it literally I mean

602
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:32,940
I've we've seen the storms we've seen

603
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:35,669
the rains we are seeing the fires

604
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,920
because the droughts every year a new

605
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,600
record a new record a new record and

606
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,600
just get used to this they will know

607
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,620
there will only be records

608
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,919
somebody said at some point you have to

609
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:48,479
realize don't think about increasing

610
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,010
temperatures think about the coldest

611
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,920
year you have ever experienced in your

612
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:56,930
life for the next 50 years has been this

613
00:25:52,920 --> 00:26:00,090
summer right it's the only get hotter

614
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:02,100
globally it locally maybe gets very cold

615
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,590
we don't know because weather is not

616
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,600
climate

617
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:07,570
you're right I'd have to clarify that

618
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,520
you know that okay so much more snow or

619
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:12,279
no snow whatsoever more droughts or

620
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,260
extreme storms extreme rain flooding all

621
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:17,289
of that stuff will be daily business

622
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:21,240
we know that my house is -4 enough

623
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:21,240
meters below sea level awesome choice I

624
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:28,450
need a double facepalm name here ok so

625
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:31,000
that's that's that's weather yeah

626
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:34,240
ecosystem services as its fancily called

627
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,669
just nature right pollination we all

628
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,250
heard about the bees right and then I

629
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:41,320
think Trump has just rolled back laws to

630
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:44,200
protect the bees who the cares

631
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:48,490
about bees right there just insects okay

632
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:52,230
so bees go humans come after it yeah any

633
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:54,669
sector dying off arable land loss

634
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:57,250
quality of the soil is degrading

635
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:58,539
globally everywhere right because we

636
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,539
have this for that forest we cut them

637
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:03,640
down we do intensive agriculture on them

638
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:06,340
we exhaustion or soil it gets eroded

639
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,289
away the desert we move to the next

640
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:11,220
piece of forest until there's no forest

641
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:13,360
and then all right so that's going on

642
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:17,200
which means that the ability to capture

643
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,049
carbon is going down at the same time

644
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,350
the production of methane stuff rotting

645
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:25,000
away is going up now methane single

646
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,610
molecule methane has the global warming

647
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,549
potential twenty times twenty thousand

648
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:32,350
times that of carbon dioxide right so

649
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:35,500
one molecule of methane is twenty

650
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,178
thousand molecules of co2 and now we're

651
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,130
waiting and that's we're seeing that now

652
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:41,940
too for the Siberian tundra to start

653
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:44,200
melting and when that starts melting

654
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,940
millions of square kilometers will start

655
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,929
rotting and we're going to have

656
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:51,580
explosions of methane and that's your

657
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:53,200
non-linearity and because you get into

658
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,750
these feedback cycles it just gets worse

659
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,510
and worse and faster and faster and

660
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:00,179
faster

661
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:01,860
you're not gonna stop it we got to learn

662
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,419
how to live with it and that's again the

663
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,428
point of this whole talk so ecologic

664
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:07,440
economic awesome increase inequality

665
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:09,450
instability food prices energy prices

666
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,070
anything you can imagine we will be more

667
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:14,130
expensive there is just no way around it

668
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,840
that's how economy works right economy

669
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,610
inequality is gonna kill us this is what

670
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,620
causes revolutions right when you start

671
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:21,418
hanging billionaires from trees at some

672
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,668
point on it they will be in there New

673
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:26,669
Zealand bunkers locked up they don't

674
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:28,169
care which means that not all you're

675
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:30,030
going to be more everything's gonna be

676
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:32,040
expensive but your ability to make money

677
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,510
is gonna go down because all the

678
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,090
traditional ways of doing things will

679
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:39,440
not work anymore your farmer you wanna

680
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:42,600
make money raising fruit forget about it

681
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,100
maybe suddenly botswana is awesome for

682
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,360
something else but then you need to be

683
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,110
there to be able to do it but you're

684
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,899
here so how does that logistic change

685
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,520
just getting the basic stuff you know

686
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,169
how about we get the permanent storm

687
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,059
like like jupiter has a wonderful

688
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:58,890
prominent storm right the red spot there

689
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:01,049
is no reason why we will have and i

690
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,600
don't know red have a nice big permanent

691
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:06,450
storm over the atlantic no ship ever can

692
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,639
pass goodbye supply chains globally and

693
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:12,210
store it no more Aliexpress can you

694
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,130
imagine like oh my god yeah so you're

695
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,799
gonna have disrupted supply chains stuff

696
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,270
is gonna be late you won't be get you

697
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,010
don't be able to get your raw products

698
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:21,570
right oh you want to build this nice

699
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,250
spin turbine or awesome you need any

700
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,909
audio magnets how only China makes them

701
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,070
oops

702
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:27,900
Chinese haven't sailed for months

703
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:31,230
because there's a typhoon that keeps on

704
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:34,080
coming back goods and so forth and so

705
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:37,080
forth right and we already see the I

706
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,928
mean Pratchett is a wonderful test right

707
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,520
it is right I mean they're there we

708
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:43,500
should be thankful for the insane guinea

709
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,970
pig experiment Brits will have a huge

710
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,460
problem just when if they go hard

711
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,730
Bridget they will literally drown in pig

712
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,690


713
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:53,610
and trash right they have no capacity to

714
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:56,070
process their own trash they sell it to

715
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:58,260
Sweden and to Holland suddenly you have

716
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,820
to make two weeks to get the processing

717
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:03,510
of the papers rush if of trash in the

718
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:05,250
meantime is piling up and then what the

719
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,720
animal supply chain is just-in-time

720
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,340
animals are moving across the channel

721
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,480
all the time they have to be stopped or

722
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,340
controls they back up the four

723
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,440
the farm containers for pig I just

724
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:17,970
get full they spill over into the

725
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:22,330
waterways and this happens within a week

726
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:24,760
four days they've done the math now

727
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:27,699
imagine not being able to move goods for

728
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:30,240
years I don't know maybe doesn't happen

729
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:33,400
maybe it does can you deal with it

730
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,710
financial right all the signs are on

731
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,780
green for an intense economic crisis

732
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:40,120
again right we fix the banking crisis

733
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,530
except you didn't fix anything right it

734
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,780
didn't change anything we just gave the

735
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,850
money oh look you up here's money

736
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:48,240
I wish my job looked like that oh you

737
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:50,230
 up awesome i triple your salary

738
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,110
that's what you did to banks so they're

739
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:54,100
gonna up again exactly the same way

740
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:57,520
we're gonna build them out again because

741
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:59,310
they're too big to fail again so that's

742
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,110
you know you can see it already right

743
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:04,270
Marc Marc gets the collective AI that

744
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,010
markets are seeking for stability we are

745
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:08,350
getting this property boom-bust cycles

746
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:11,140
again solvency is here property

747
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:12,490
Australia no that's a very bad place to

748
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,310
own houses right now because they're

749
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,780
about to crash us the same precious

750
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:19,030
metal hoarding just look at the gold

751
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:21,190
price recently the Russians have I don't

752
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:24,879
know queen tupled the amount of reserved

753
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:26,350
gold which means so derivatives right

754
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,630
all the financial instruments have been

755
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,889
speculated on there is an estimate and

756
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,440
nobody can really done do the math

757
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,970
between hundred and 100,000 times more

758
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,330
money in derivatives than in the real

759
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:40,450
economy there's incredible amounts of

760
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:42,040
money gets moving around but oh no we

761
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:45,630
can't afford to fix the bridges there is

762
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:50,590
no money yeah it's being traded with

763
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:52,960
it's gone so cash is being removed okay

764
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,669
 we need to do something we it can't

765
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,520
afford it

766
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:58,570
social okay I've pointed out Bangladesh

767
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,010
I pointed out China

768
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:03,730
I bought it out Pakistan all those

769
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:06,250
places so ok think about the Balkans the

770
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:08,530
Europe the current refugee crisis and

771
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:12,550
what that has caused now multiply that

772
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:14,830
by 100 million and I'm not inventing

773
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:16,090
numbers here what 100,000 refugees have

774
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,050
come to Europe something like that that

775
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:20,889
order of magnitude

776
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:22,690
now imagine 300 million leaving

777
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,120
Bangladesh I mean I would leave if my

778
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:28,240
house is on the meter

779
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:31,090
Bangladesh gets flooded and then people

780
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,950
move of course so what does what is that

781
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:37,899
going to do to the social stability to

782
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:40,150
politics right then aging population

783
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,880
right look at the Western Europe is just

784
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:45,100
incredibly old thank you baby boomers

785
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,930
right when you're afraid when you're

786
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,610
uncertain and you full of Alzheimer what

787
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:50,110
do you do you vote conservative it was

788
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,810
all but you know it all used to be

789
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:54,669
greater it was all super in the past so

790
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,200
you're gonna vote for the religious

791
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:58,530
extremists because you know religion

792
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,720
that's safe that's tradition that's I

793
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:03,370
know that you're gonna work you're going

794
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,050
to vote for nationalist because all but

795
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:06,909
they're keeping us safe you're gonna go

796
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,200
for racist because now the brown

797
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,670
people we don't want that because

798
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,220
they're weird estranged they're not

799
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:14,380
humans right it's just us all that kind

800
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:16,810
of crap comes back because people are

801
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,660
afraid and afraid nobody you know of

802
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:21,520
course you're afraid that makes sense

803
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:23,500
strongman fetish right will Trump loves

804
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,180
Putin everybody loves Trump because you

805
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,320
know that's how fascism comes in because

806
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,200
that's the obsession with power

807
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,570
obsession with the strongman and all the

808
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,870
neoliberal of all we have to do

809
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:36,010
more markets are awesome as the British

810
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:38,530
how it worked out for the train system

811
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:39,670
or anything else right ask Americans how

812
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,950
free market is working for their

813
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:44,230
insurance health insurance it's great if

814
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:47,410
you're the one selling insurance okay

815
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:49,590
which means no safety nets not spending

816
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:51,370
on infrastructure because that's

817
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:53,230
infrastructure why would you do that

818
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:56,330
that's not making money nobody's making

819
00:33:53,230 --> 00:34:00,260
money on that oops

820
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:02,720
so again a system every everything every

821
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:04,100
effect you see every symptom is a cause

822
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,120
of another problem which caused another

823
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,550
symptom which caused you know the

824
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,839
problem there is no single cause single

825
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,949
solution they're all connected because

826
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,630
there's the money you cannot invest

827
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:13,460
because you can't invest you cannot

828
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,929
resist it climate change because of that

829
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,370
you can change infrastructure because of

830
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:19,480
that you keep on the meeting because

831
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:21,409
you're meeting and so on right

832
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,179
technological right I don't have to talk

833
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:27,649
to you about surveillance in crypto and

834
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:30,050
lack of it right we are pretty good at

835
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:31,760
that so pervasive fully automated

836
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:34,280
surveillance made compulsory I can

837
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,010
imagine having to provide the retinal

838
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,740
scan to get bread ask any refugee in any

839
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,750
Syrian camp that's how it works you show

840
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:44,029
up you have your bags with you that's

841
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,710
all you have you provide retinal scans

842
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,660
you get oh you get your little card and

843
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:50,990
that's how you get food you don't want

844
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:53,719
to give retinal scans you don't eat your

845
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:56,060
choice now when this is standard in

846
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:58,279
Holland I don't know maybe it's

847
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:01,279
completely logical consequence of having

848
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,730
to contain control reduced access to or

849
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,590
limitations or no criminalization of

850
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:08,390
information in technology right

851
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:11,390
anybody got arrested for having car

852
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:13,040
Linux on the laptop now you got a hell

853
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,390
of a lot to explain them to the security

854
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,000
officer what if it's actually against

855
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:18,410
the law to circumvent something because

856
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,660
that's the thing that you have to prove

857
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:23,810
who you're oops

858
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:25,279
and in pockets further accelerating

859
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,620
acceleration of high-tech because it's

860
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,720
so valuable and it'll be in so many so

861
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:32,839
few hands it gives you so much advantage

862
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,939
is going to start accumulating right in

863
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:38,390
many ways think about you know the

864
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:40,340
Fallout series game right right it's the

865
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:45,759
zombies in mutants and super space

866
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:45,760
rockets that's actually pretty plausible

867
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:51,550
energy increase in price we talked about

868
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,810
energy about increased Kappa increased

869
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,460
storage capacity or let's build

870
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:57,549
batteries where you buying the batteries

871
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:59,160
in China right maybe they won't sell it

872
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,540
to you maybe they can't sell it to you

873
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,460
there's not enough lithium can you mind

874
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,410
leading from the Chilean from the Andes

875
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:08,010
oh no you can't because the storms have

876
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:11,379
wiped out order all the roads oops

877
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:13,089
fuels and then well you know stability

878
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,740
of supply can act upon catechin obligate

879
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:17,619
renewables awesome but when you oboes

880
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:20,649
are cyclical sure I can stabilize that

881
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:23,740
but anima batteries oops I can't afford

882
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:26,440
them oh I don't have resources maybe

883
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:28,029
account by the neo diem from my fire

884
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,270
magnets because something happened and

885
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,410
we depend on a few critical metals

886
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:35,640
stability of distribution my grid is

887
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:38,859
down all we just decentralized uh-huh

888
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,569
have I talked to utility companies and

889
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:42,069
they said sure this is a small local

890
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:43,750
company that runs Rotterdam and the

891
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,730
south of Holland they need hundred

892
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:47,859
billion to fix the grid to be fully

893
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,119
decentralized they say there is I don't

894
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:50,589
know where on earth I can buy enough

895
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,359
copper to put it to ground to do this

896
00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:57,070
and every single Street has to be opened

897
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:59,230
up I ain't gonna happen they can use

898
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:01,359
gold oil adds that's much cheaper at

899
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:04,270
some point right so you cannot just

900
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:05,859
decentralize sure if you're a remote

901
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:07,509
village in Africa that has zero

902
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:11,049
infrastructure of course you can build

903
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:12,760
decentralized not in Europe right

904
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:14,020
another tear up stuff just to be fancy

905
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,960
with distributing we're going to keep on

906
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,400
doing what you're doing right and that

907
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,260
requires incredible investment in

908
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,580
materials in effort in political will

909
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,260
which we don't have because it's far

910
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,029
more important that you are this that

911
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,609
you want a Muslim that you actually Pro

912
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:29,490
investment in infrastructure and then

913
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:33,160
you get voted in right

914
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:34,390
transport you know think about in the

915
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,430
long term forget about travel

916
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:38,348
internationally now maybe not allowed to

917
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:40,240
I mean it's stupid saying this a Serbia

918
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:41,650
people could not travel for many many

919
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,348
years you know simply not you don't get

920
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:48,339
a visa too bad have you followed what

921
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:51,099
the US is doing to to the people who are

922
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:53,799
hit by the hurricane right most of those

923
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:56,530
people were able to travel from Bahamas

924
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,210
to us no problem suddenly ship full of

925
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:03,580
refugees nobody has nothing

926
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:06,070
everybody who has no visa gtfo that's it

927
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,420
you just and now what bout you stay on

928
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,280
your island but there is literally

929
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:13,270
nothing there well that's too bad you

930
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,850
should have had a visa and so you see it

931
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:19,420
it's not I'm not inventing it the

932
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:21,040
gradation of local in front right us

933
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,400
infrastructure which infrastructure

934
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,320
right okay be a little bit better here

935
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,330
but if you can't maintain your

936
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,130
infrastructure like roads or your trains

937
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:31,960
and you're getting more and more

938
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,670
frequently hit by storms that disrupt

939
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,850
things you have to expend more and more

940
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:38,530
and more money to maintain and you cost

941
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:41,560
will arise exponentially just like your

942
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:43,390
damages go and I'm not even talking

943
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,799
about things like that the all the

944
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,490
people who put in the infrastructure

945
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,740
like electricity

946
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,209
aren't by now in pension and the

947
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,189
utilities let you don't have the people

948
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,980
who know how it works and the peak of

949
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:55,360
stuff failing because of age is directly

950
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,850
going together with the age of the

951
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,990
people who built it and there's panic in

952
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,870
infrastructure land I can tell you

953
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:04,419
because there's nobody there to fix it

954
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:05,370
even if we knew how to do it even if you

955
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:11,920
had the money

956
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:13,359
now what medicine on one side you know

957
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,880
there's a wonderful paper in nature

958
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:18,730
review of the articles we expect that by

959
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,320
now if you below fifteen twenty you can

960
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:25,030
you can expect to live to be hundred

961
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:27,030
twenty probably okay that's awesome so

962
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:30,460
the old people will stay old even longer

963
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:31,630
and vote writing even longer no

964
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:35,440
offense to all people there's lots of

965
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:37,000
same old people but not on mass right so

966
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,410
they will be awesome things right gene

967
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,240
editing is around the corner we can do

968
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:42,670
that crispers here we will be able to

969
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,200
fix all these things very very soon and

970
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,610
once the hits the fan nobody's

971
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,640
gonna bother about ethical permissions

972
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:51,370
we'll just do it but that's only for the

973
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:53,319
0.001% not for you and me libera

974
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:55,390
diversity means less new drugs right

975
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:58,240
still we find the most new antibiotic

976
00:39:55,390 --> 00:40:01,230
leads from the forest we just bring

977
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,669
burning for the last months upon months

978
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:04,990
general available available to drugs you

979
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,400
know god save you if you have to take

980
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:08,439
away the communication every single day

981
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,640
I had a similar experience myself my

982
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,309
some pills I take that I have to take

983
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,078
that cannot stop taking we're not

984
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:16,970
available in the country because Bridget

985
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,619
Posada coming the holding period paying

986
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:22,390
better price in the markets accessable

987
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:23,779
story Holland those are sold in UK you

988
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:27,170
need them

989
00:40:23,779 --> 00:40:30,200
yeah of cookies right but the real thing

990
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:32,299
that happens right now antibiotic

991
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,009
resistance is increasing heavily because

992
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:35,029
of overuse in bad situations you're

993
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,950
going to get it worse because people

994
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:39,289
won't forget it won't finish the doses

995
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:44,598
they won't have enough and so forth and

996
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:52,160
so forth right so and science are you

997
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:54,529
depressed yet I am and the thing is this

998
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,779
is it this is real this is happening we

999
00:40:54,529 --> 00:40:59,299
can act as if it's not there we can say

1000
00:40:56,779 --> 00:41:01,880
whatever it's there now you can either

1001
00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:03,230
go into panic mode and whatever or you

1002
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,869
can say okay we're nerds

1003
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:08,269
you're hackers we have a limitation we

1004
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:11,029
have a problem what are the good ways to

1005
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:15,459
fix it right challenge accepted come on

1006
00:41:11,029 --> 00:41:19,190
bring it on and it's not gonna be easy

1007
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:20,750
and it's gonna take centuries literally

1008
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:24,920
centuries so who can think about

1009
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:26,359
centuries I don't know that's that's so

1010
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,450
we move into design so what I want to

1011
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:30,920
talk about are robust and adaptive

1012
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:32,240
strategies right I don't want to talk

1013
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,329
about details I don't want to talk about

1014
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,479
oh by Cannes or by water filters that's

1015
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:39,799
not but what are the ways to behave what

1016
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,569
are the ways to think what are the

1017
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:44,420
useful things that we as a community of

1018
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:46,579
hackers do that can be beneficial for

1019
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:51,109
the long term we're going to be

1020
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:52,549
facing next 300 years 4x 3000 years so

1021
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:53,720
there's a bunch of useless stuff that

1022
00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:55,549
you shouldn't do right to the extreme

1023
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,569
prepping the in the woods kind of I'm

1024
00:41:55,549 --> 00:42:00,890
just gonna go into the forest we write

1025
00:41:58,569 --> 00:42:03,109
especially in the Hague right there I

1026
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,430
have about three square meters of green

1027
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:06,799
grass in front of my house and that's

1028
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:08,210
the only nature in the nearest 40 square

1029
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:11,029
kilometers so no you're not gonna go

1030
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:12,769
anywhere plus with the moment to go

1031
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:14,119
somewhere with your nice hoard of stuff

1032
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:16,549
then people come and take it from you

1033
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:19,190
and that's it and bullets do run out

1034
00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:20,779
right hoarding all of that paranoia

1035
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:22,370
panic that doesn't make any sense it's

1036
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:24,950
not sustainable you cannot operate

1037
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:28,100
society on paranoia and hoarding that

1038
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:30,049
doesn't work but you do have to be

1039
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,520
prepared because you know you are going

1040
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,810
to be hit by extreme weather there is no

1041
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,230
discussions about it the question is

1042
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:38,180
when and how bad and if its shape now

1043
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:42,260
because I live in the Netherlands I know

1044
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:43,970
two things storms floods that's that's

1045
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,800
what you get we don't get earthquakes

1046
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:47,450
that's fine and they are not coupled to

1047
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,070
climate change anyway we don't get

1048
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:51,649
drought but yeah okay but that's if

1049
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:54,260
you're we flee with running and show

1050
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:55,490
shits on your head because hey okay so

1051
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:59,660
that's a completely different discussion

1052
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:01,520
anyway so okay so I have to be prepared

1053
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,109
for a serious storm breaking my windows

1054
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,680
amount that's just a very likely

1055
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:08,210
scenario okay so can I handle that so

1056
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,750
that kind of preparation yes that makes

1057
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:13,280
perfect sense

1058
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:17,030
oh but screw this I'll just leave no you

1059
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,820
want right you want because first it's

1060
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:22,070
gonna take forever to build up then very

1061
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,900
going to go right we've seen wars we've

1062
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:26,450
seen refugees we seen people emigrating

1063
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,400
hey I'm an immigrant who's gonna take

1064
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:29,960
you because it's everywhere it's

1065
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,790
not like there's a local war here but

1066
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:35,180
it's all wonderful across the border no

1067
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:36,529
they have their own so it's not

1068
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:38,690
gonna be any better just the bush it

1069
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,910
will change but it's gonna be there they

1070
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:43,520
won't have you right I mean something

1071
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:46,549
with borders and walls and stuff right

1072
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,490
and so that gonna happen but you might

1073
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:50,870
have to write after your home has been

1074
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:53,569
flooded for three weeks I know there was

1075
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:54,740
a case in Serbia recently voracity was

1076
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:57,770
flooded for weeks on end

1077
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:59,089
Oh we'll stay well after a week maybe I

1078
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:02,690
should just leave because it's not gonna

1079
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:05,000
go away not the next three weeks so you

1080
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,740
might have to eat what does that even

1081
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,020
mean to prepare for this kind I mean it

1082
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,160
is scary right it isn't but you got to

1083
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,890
think about it because that's a thing

1084
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,770
maybe not to you directly but certainly

1085
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:18,720
for your kids right

1086
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:22,109
so the hacker attitude I think that's a

1087
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,069
very sustainable thing to do right so

1088
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:23,520
that's why I talk about these things

1089
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,440
here

1090
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,550
I don't talked about this to my

1091
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,619
scientist colleagues because they're

1092
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:30,089
like what the hell are you talking about

1093
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:31,740
curious right there open things up

1094
00:44:30,089 --> 00:44:34,349
because you might have to constantly

1095
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:36,569
open things up there to learn new things

1096
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:40,140
because that's sustainability is the

1097
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:41,250
ability to retain adaptive capacity all

1098
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,440
right if you cannot adapt you're not

1099
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:45,420
sustainable you need to be critical

1100
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,369
right don't take things at face value we

1101
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,320
all do that right follow the money

1102
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:51,300
follow the power follow the passion

1103
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,410
that's where you know aha why the why

1104
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,540
are they telling me the story are

1105
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:58,348
because the fanatics oh there's money to

1106
00:44:54,540 --> 00:45:00,960
be made huh maybe act upon it and create

1107
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:03,180
it right improvise and repair and hack

1108
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,710
and make do with what you have you make

1109
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,089
new things that's what you're going to

1110
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:08,070
have to do or at least that's the stuff

1111
00:45:06,089 --> 00:45:09,930
you have to teach your kids how to do

1112
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:11,599
because that's what they will be built

1113
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:16,169
doing the rest of their lives and

1114
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:17,520
creating value right so notice I'm not

1115
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:19,740
talking about very concrete things

1116
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,080
because I can't I mean I have I have

1117
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,609
ideas how this works for me but that

1118
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,140
might make no sense to you whatsoever

1119
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:26,279
because your context is different your

1120
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,779
skills of their furniture interest a

1121
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,359
different and so what's the balance

1122
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,580
between being smart being prepared not

1123
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:36,390
panicking having fun in life but not

1124
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:37,980
being stupid right but I think creating

1125
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:39,420
value creating new things is a good

1126
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,310
thing to do no matter what you doing and

1127
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,869
if not if nothing bad happens hey we

1128
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:47,009
made the better world by accident that's

1129
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:49,859
awesome so use make improve open source

1130
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:51,900
I fundamentally believe and everything

1131
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:54,270
I've studied about sustainability open

1132
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,070
source is the only way to go when the

1133
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:57,480
company has been you know when the chip

1134
00:45:56,070 --> 00:46:01,170
maker has been spoiled on three meters

1135
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:03,000
of water there's no manuals but if it's

1136
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:04,950
open source there will be somebody will

1137
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,680
have a copy sambar some nerd will have

1138
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:09,270
printed it out on paper and we have it

1139
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:13,529
we can reboot civilization with open

1140
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:15,720
source not at Microsoft right so please

1141
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:18,330
keep on doing that so Tremmel thanks for

1142
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,720
the driver bad boy don't use closed

1143
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:20,720
software

1144
00:46:20,749 --> 00:46:25,979
I'm sorry okay you know what I mean

1145
00:46:23,969 --> 00:46:27,299
but but that's the idea right I mean you

1146
00:46:25,979 --> 00:46:28,739
need to be able to do that because you

1147
00:46:27,299 --> 00:46:32,940
will not be able to bootstrap otherwise

1148
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:34,890
if you have to so software hardware low

1149
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:37,259
tech that's very important we need to be

1150
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:39,690
able to do open source low tech there is

1151
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:41,279
the open open farms a hardest path to

1152
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:43,609
put to Lincoln there's open source

1153
00:46:41,279 --> 00:46:45,900
project for making farm machinery

1154
00:46:43,609 --> 00:46:47,578
brilliant right teach people how to make

1155
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,589
plows and tractors because you might

1156
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:51,269
have to some point be able to do that

1157
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:53,038
when the big companies either don't

1158
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:57,180
allow you to use it or did they just

1159
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:59,459
don't exist anymore we are making iron

1160
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:02,609
from from dirt is that a smart thing to

1161
00:46:59,459 --> 00:47:05,279
do no it's useless but it's getting into

1162
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:06,479
the mode of hey what can I do because

1163
00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:07,999

00:47:16,979 --> 00:47:20,759
gear keep on doing that

1169
00:47:17,999 --> 00:47:21,868

1171
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:25,680
bringing workshops on sewing fixing

1172
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:27,989

1173
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,609
something is broken you fix it we didn't

1174
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:33,690
what who knows how to use a sewing

1175
00:47:29,609 --> 00:47:35,640
machine right okay that's better than I

1176
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,890
thought so awesome teach do a workshop

1177

1178
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:42,989
we need to know that so educate named

1179
00:47:41,279 --> 00:47:45,539
things you see things maybe because

1180
00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:46,709
you're smart or obsessed it's something

1181
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:47,279
you might recognize something other

1182
00:47:46,709 --> 00:47:49,499
people don't

1183
00:47:47,279 --> 00:47:51,690
hey guys there is something going on oh

1184
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:54,180
wow I never thought about that do that

1185
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:58,229
talk about it observe and point out

1186
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:59,910
teach and train yes document

1187
00:47:58,229 --> 00:48:03,569
thank you that needs to be the document

1188
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:06,149
leave a trace right put it on Vicky how

1189
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:09,180
and then run a mirror yeah

1190
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:10,799
organize events sessions workshops

1191
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:13,219
cooperatives unions

1192
00:48:10,799 --> 00:48:15,390
I don't care we need organized humans

1193
00:48:13,219 --> 00:48:15,989
can we trust the government to do this

1194
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:18,930
stuff for us

1195
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:20,670
no because maybe if you're

1196
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:23,839
lucky we can pull it off at a national

1197
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:26,329
level government year level maybe but

1198
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:29,469
this is maybe more sustainable

1199
00:48:26,329 --> 00:48:31,729
I don't know and of course this right

1200
00:48:29,469 --> 00:48:36,609
why are we not offering first-aid

1201
00:48:31,729 --> 00:48:36,609
training during Balkan yes

1202
00:48:36,769 --> 00:48:40,698
yeah but just as a bit just basics you

1203
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:42,618
don't I get certified but just learn

1204
00:48:40,699 --> 00:48:47,029
basic stuff I mean you can use that

1205
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:49,189
every day just awareness oh ok I might

1206
00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:51,109
get the I might get hit by a bad storm

1207
00:48:49,189 --> 00:48:53,928
hmm what what does that mean just the

1208
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:55,729
fact that you thought about it when you

1209
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:57,650
having a coffee or having your mattr

1210
00:48:55,729 --> 00:49:00,499
already makes you more prepared and if

1211
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:02,269
you've never thought about it let alone

1212
00:49:00,499 --> 00:49:04,879
that you have materials to board up your

1213
00:49:02,269 --> 00:49:06,049
windows just laying in the shed or maybe

1214
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,949
you don't have a shared well ok what

1215
00:49:06,049 --> 00:49:11,359
else can I do right so context dependent

1216
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:14,630
disaster preparedness and ad hoc

1217
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:18,109
organizational skills right are you able

1218
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:19,249
in chaos to get organized alright can

1219
00:49:18,109 --> 00:49:21,288
you pull off a stunt at the hacker

1220
00:49:19,249 --> 00:49:22,519
conference when everybody's running

1221
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:24,949
around having too much sensory overload

1222
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:27,439
and still stuff happens right these are

1223
00:49:24,949 --> 00:49:31,239
fun and cool things to do trains you to

1224
00:49:27,439 --> 00:49:33,410
be ad hoc thinking on your feet yeah and

1225
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:35,929
all of this is extremely context

1226
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:38,149
dependent so it's very hard to have a

1227
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:41,809
specific advice on or specific thoughts

1228
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:43,219
on what makes sense maybe there are

1229
00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:45,739
things that make sense for me because

1230
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:48,229
I'm much stronger than you well maybe

1231
00:49:45,739 --> 00:49:49,789
just maybe a petite female so the

1232
00:49:48,229 --> 00:49:51,169
solutions that work for me that involve

1233
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:53,569
lifting heavy things don't work for you

1234
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:56,390
but you will fit in a smaller space so

1235
00:49:53,569 --> 00:49:58,670
maybe in that sense the skills that you

1236
00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:00,679
develop fit your context right maybe you

1237
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:03,229
have access to your some resources that

1238
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:05,420
I don't have but think about it it's a

1239
00:50:03,229 --> 00:50:07,928
hack right so what can you do try to

1240
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,929
find them

1241
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:11,618
so now what

1242
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:17,300
well first it's too late to be

1243
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:18,828
pessimistic I've heard this about a year

1244
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,869
ago at the business conference and never

1245
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:23,150
expected somebody to say this and this

1246
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:24,500
personally did me a lot of good right

1247
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:26,780
it's too late to be a pessimist you can

1248
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:29,690
say okay it's all going to hell at some

1249
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:31,579
point in more or less distant future

1250
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:36,890
let's just throw a big party and that's

1251
00:50:31,579 --> 00:50:39,050
it doesn't work but yes you yes you can

1252
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:40,940
yes you can try because if you do our

1253
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:43,400
best as society as humans it will suck

1254
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:45,500
less you will not be able to prevent

1255
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,510
major climate change major disruptions

1256
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:50,680
that will happen period the question is

1257
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:53,300
just how bad and we can reduce the bad

1258
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,549
so go out and have fun that's important

1259
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:58,339
no nervous prepping I'm almost done

1260
00:50:55,550 --> 00:51:00,230
thank you go out and have fun have fun

1261
00:50:58,339 --> 00:51:01,940
observing and planning have fun teaching

1262
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:04,280
the learning have fun getting organized

1263
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:06,619
enjoy because you enjoy it it's fun it's

1264
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:08,210
awesome people get involved and we

1265
00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:11,300
collectively become more resilient more

1266
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:14,030
adaptive innovating create but keep in

1267
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,890
mind right I was so happy when the batch

1268
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:18,049
team that made the shot bad you see them

1269
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:20,200
running the lights says we do not want

1270
00:51:18,049 --> 00:51:22,250
to make a waste right how many

1271
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,450
conference badges are really awesome in

1272
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:26,599
the ER that's awesome and they go into

1273
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:28,730
the drawer and then to the trash right

1274
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:30,410
sure make a badge but make it so that

1275
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:32,140
after the event it's awesome and useful

1276
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:34,578
and ends up being doing something useful

1277
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:36,440
it just means more it's a yet anot

1278
00:51:34,579 --> 00:51:39,980
design constraint makes it more

1279
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:41,329
interesting to design that's great so do

1280
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,950
your things but just think of the big

1281
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:44,480
big picture you cannot live in constant

1282
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:47,689
stress of oh my god one day we all die

1283
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,069
of course all died right but can i what

1284
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:51,410
am i doing how does it fit in the big

1285
00:51:49,069 --> 00:51:53,808
thing and go out and vote they still

1286
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:56,230
have democracy keep it going do go out

1287
00:51:53,809 --> 00:51:59,960
and vote especially if you're young

1288
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:01,369
because you will not vote for reaction

1289
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,049
is you will vote for the future

1290
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:05,359
right we've seen in the latest European

1291
00:52:03,049 --> 00:52:08,890
elections swing to the greens because

1292
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:12,120
young people went out devoted do that

1293
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:18,650
beat this guy

1294
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:18,650
right bring it on we can do this

1295
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:25,159
[Music]

1296
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:35,990
welcome questions comments Tomatoes

1297
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:35,990
anything I cannot hear

1298
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:42,090
how many laws is ethically to break

1299
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:45,780
while changing the world to a better

1300
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:47,820
place there's a lot of stuff that's

1301
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:50,340
illegal but morally correct and there

1302
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:52,770
are lots of deeply immoral laws right

1303
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:55,830
yes I always like to remind people that

1304
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:58,470
that Holocaust was perfectly legal right

1305
00:52:55,830 --> 00:53:01,020
so think about that and also that

1306
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:04,950
depends maybe you can break more or more

1307
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:07,290
laws than I can because how many laws

1308
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:08,520
can you afford to break right I don't

1309
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:10,710
know that depends sure everybody's

1310
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:14,190
different but better you should at some

1311
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:16,220
point probably the better way is to vote

1312
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:20,400
the right way and change the laws that's

1313
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:23,060
less risky in some this most countries

1314
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,060
that's less risky

1315
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:27,410
yes

1316
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:38,849
so I actually have this thing ah yeah

1317
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:41,640
hello yeah so my question is kind of

1318
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:44,010
political related also so you don't vote

1319
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,520
the right way right I do not understand

1320
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:47,849
what you're saying

1321
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:50,339
you said vote the right way okay vote

1322
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:52,440
the right way yeah vote the right thing

1323
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:54,869
but what would be the right way because

1324
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:57,569
if we eventually at the end of the day

1325
00:53:54,869 --> 00:54:01,650
what happens is in a democratic system

1326
00:53:57,569 --> 00:54:04,619
you get always media that is going to be

1327
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:06,630
biased for someone and you will not

1328
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:09,510
generally not have a neutral media or

1329
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:12,569
anything like that so even whether it is

1330
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:15,569
a fastest hyper nationalist leader who

1331
00:54:12,569 --> 00:54:17,520
doesn't give a about climate and or

1332
00:54:15,569 --> 00:54:20,009
it's a fascist hyper nationalist or

1333
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:23,190
authoritarian leader who gives a lot of

1334
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:25,319
 about climate hey it's always kinda

1335
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,770
yeah yeah you're damned if you do damned

1336
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:28,020
if you don't

1337
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:31,050
I don't know yeah so because I know for

1338
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:33,900
example back in India the force

1339
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:36,960
implemented plastic bands right whereas

1340
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:39,390
I have visited in some countries where I

1341
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,059
buy two items like one soft drink and

1342
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:44,190
some salad so each one of them get a big

1343
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:45,869
plastic bag from the this thing where I

1344
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:50,490
can just carry them from it in my hand

1345
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:53,069
and just go off but does politics really

1346
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:55,770
help or is it more like people awareness

1347
00:54:53,069 --> 00:54:59,279
like how we talk more about it and stuff

1348
00:54:55,770 --> 00:55:01,259
if anything it's all of them right it's

1349
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,809
never just one thing it's do the one but

1350
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,490
also do the others so like Churchill

1351
00:55:03,809 --> 00:55:08,790
said right it's the least that system we

1352
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:10,348
have it's not perfect and yes you might

1353
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:11,609
have to choose between the two of the

1354
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:14,910
lesser evils right the lesser of the two

1355
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:17,520
evils I don't know I mean in my context

1356
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:20,520
I have a clear choice the progressive

1357
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,839
forward-looking political parties and

1358
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:25,470
the ones that don't do that and there

1359
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:27,089
that's fine if you don't I don't know

1360
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:28,439
but that's at least it's a thing you

1361
00:55:27,089 --> 00:55:29,849
should think about if nothing else

1362
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,730
that's really I guess what I'm trying to

1363
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:35,130
say is that be aware and yes you can

1364
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:36,210
there is research that shows if you can

1365
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:38,700
get three and half percent of the

1366
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:41,130
population you do have enough mass to

1367
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:42,750
actually change society if you can get a

1368
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:44,700
hive mind of three and a percent

1369
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:47,590
population and that's not that

1370
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:50,560
right and so look at what a greater

1371
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:52,420
thumb burg is doing right that's no

1372
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,920
that's that's that's powerful right

1373
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:55,990
something is happening people are waking

1374
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,400
up whether it's on time but rich enough

1375
00:55:55,990 --> 00:56:00,720
we don't know but it's helluva better

1376
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:03,190
than nothing so that's kind of them

1377
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:06,419
sorry it cannot be more useful specific

1378
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:06,420
than that but I don't know

1379
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:14,660
I told you the depressive talk nobody

1380
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,660
asked questions

1381
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,830
yes please there is a lot

1382
00:56:19,299 --> 00:56:24,179
I can you really need to make a carrot

1383
00:56:21,939 --> 00:56:24,178
here you

1384
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:30,609
have you considered climate's

1385
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,030
self-healing capabilities oh yeah

1386
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:33,910
totally

1387
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:37,210
look planet is fine panels been there

1388
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:40,299
done that this doesn't care I do not

1389
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:41,770
worry at all about the planet right this

1390
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:44,110
is not about the planet this is not

1391
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:46,750
about nature this only is strictly about

1392
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:48,340
humanity surviving right I mean we had

1393
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:50,470
massive die-offs the planet throughout

1394
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,070
history that's what nature does it kills

1395
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:52,660
everything

1396
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:54,310
something survives makes lots of new

1397
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:55,600
stuff kills all of that again and keeps

1398
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,910
on doing that so this is just yet

1399
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:00,580
another one of those things at the

1400
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:02,470
global scale this is irrelevant right if

1401
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:04,779
you die off tomorrow climate will be

1402
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:06,040
somewhere at some state right there'll

1403
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,990
be more trees there there be more

1404
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:12,070
deserts there that nature doesn't give a

1405
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:13,569
 we happen to do right

1406
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:15,790
sustainability is not about to freaking

1407
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:19,360
pandas it's about you and your kids and

1408
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:22,420
their kids and their kids kids it's not

1409
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:24,100
about the bees and they'd be fine right

1410
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:26,410
there's bacteria evolving right now that

1411
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,819
is plastics they free food awesome

1412
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:29,799
that's what nature does it adapts the

1413
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:32,320
resources uses the Magnon I'm dead

1414
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,850
serious that's what it does right nature

1415
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,590
doesn't hear about waste why do we have

1416
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,720
oil because it buried a shitload of

1417
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:39,730
stuff it has trash it's been buried the

1418
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:46,180
trash and now it brought it up oh that

1419
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:48,280
didn't work out right so at a tea we

1420
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:49,990
can't kill nature we will kill ourselves

1421
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:53,370
first because we are at the tip of the

1422
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:53,370
food chain so we go down first

1423
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:56,779
it creates lots of opportunities right

1424
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:59,209
if your cockroach

1425
00:57:56,779 --> 00:58:00,680
that's amazing if your rat it's super

1426
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:03,410
duper because you get to have the whole

1427
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:05,058
place for yourself you know and to be

1428
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:06,950
honest I really do not worry about

1429
00:58:05,059 --> 00:58:11,690
humans as a species at all

1430
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:15,019
we'll be fine we're rats current form of

1431
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:16,400
globalized society oh yes that is dead I

1432
00:58:15,019 --> 00:58:21,288
can tell you now it just doesn't know it

1433
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:23,720
yet what will come after it I have no

1434
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:25,369
clue I don't think anybody does but the

1435
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,629
way it's right now you can forget about

1436
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:30,170
that that's not going to hold it

1437
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:32,420
physically cannot we are consuming three

1438
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:34,339
or four planet Worth's resources every

1439
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:36,230
year right we are way above what the

1440
00:58:34,339 --> 00:58:37,640
planet can handle that's that that

1441
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:40,819
knowledge has been around for 50 years

1442
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:42,470
it's nothing new right so human

1443
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:44,000
individual small bands of humans going

1444
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:47,328
to be awesome in which shape or form

1445
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,170
nobody knows but globalized capitalist

1446
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:50,170
society in there

1447
00:58:56,010 --> 00:59:04,500
No well thank you very much for coming

1448
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:05,820
and bearing down on this token and I'm

1449
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,950
offering for conversations and

1450
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:11,090
discussions you'll finally have a matter

1451
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:11,089
of beer thanks

1452
