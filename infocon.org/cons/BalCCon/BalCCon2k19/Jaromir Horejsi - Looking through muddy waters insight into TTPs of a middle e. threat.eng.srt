1
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,470
our next talk is titled looking through

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,090
muddy waters instead into TTP's of a

3
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,470
mobile Eastern thread actor please

4
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,470
welcome Yomi

5
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:45,680
hello so I will start my presentation

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:48,890
about the muddy waters protectors this

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,680
threat actor it's like a PT Group and

8
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,050
like I work as a PT researcher so I've

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,629
been tracking then with also some of my

10
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,430
colleagues for some time and now I'd

11
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:02,150
like to share you like some results

12
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:04,699
which we got so this is the outline of

13
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:06,920
my presentation so this is what I plan

14
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:09,950
to tell you within the next 30 minutes

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,990
so after the introduction I will say

16
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:16,340
like a little bit about the infection

17
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:18,860
vector how the protector spreads their

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:22,299
malware then we will talk about these

19
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,650
delivery methods then the trajector

20
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:26,900
implemented several several backdoors

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,580
and they are like their custom their own

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,340
backdoors it will be like the next

23
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:34,070
session then we will continue with the

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,140
post exploitation tools they have some

25
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,779
mobile malware so I will talk about this

26
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:41,150
mobile malicious applications later some

27
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,150
false flags then I will continue with

28
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:47,390
the infrastructure then who are the

29
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:49,340
targets and victims and in the last part

30
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,220
I will mention like some of the

31
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,730
attackers mistakes like which how does

32
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,010
maybe a little bit to track them so as

33
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,620
the introduction the first like when

34
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,990
this threat actor appeared like there

35
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,620
have been like several World blog posts

36
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:10,160
starting from the second half of the

37
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:13,160
year 2017 and it continued throughout

38
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,069
the year 2018 and also a lot in the

39
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,170
beginning of the Year 2019 so they have

40
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:20,238
been developing a lot making many

41
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,849
changes and we have been tracking them

42
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,540
for some time so on this slide is just

43
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:28,010
list of few blog posts which either we

44
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,500
or some of the researchers published

45
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,329
this is the list is not complete like

46
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,120
the heavy like make much more research

47
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,940
so when you just search

48
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,180
for the medieval turkey war you'll

49
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:43,599
probably find like many other many other

50
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:47,769
posts so what is the infection vector

51
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:51,399
like how this threat actor spreads their

52
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:54,700
malware so the infection vector is not

53
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,920
so surprisingly spearfishing so they

54
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,560
send email with some attachment to

55
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,470
victims and usually if for example they

56
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:06,670
try to target some victim in one country

57
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:09,340
they used compromised emails from some

58
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:13,510
other organizations in the same country

59
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:16,420
so it looks less suspicious so they sent

60
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:19,120
they sent email this email contains some

61
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:23,078
attachments and these attachments

62
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,970
contains some macros so these are the

63
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,769
screenshots of these emails so you can

64
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,810
see like one screenshot on the left

65
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:32,140
another one on the right and you can

66
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:34,329
already see there is like some text like

67
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,980
dear company we do something in

68
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:38,799
attachment we send you something else

69
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,230
and what is the attachment like there

70
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,180
are like different cases in one case in

71
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,090
the left one there is like zip archive

72
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,489
which the victim down world and opens

73
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,319
and there is the document with macros in

74
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:54,160
some other cases like in the right one

75
00:03:50,319 --> 00:04:00,069
they include just the document itself

76
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:02,980
there's like no no archive nothing also

77
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:05,319
like few more cases in the left one they

78
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,448
used like rar archive in the right one

79
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,268
it's like some duck eggs document X file

80
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:11,949
and if you can see like it's like you're

81
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,750
blurred because of some conservation

82
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:16,870
information but in the right case for

83
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:21,070
example there is the extension of the

84
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:23,680
email dot gough Jo sits like some kind

85
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,599
of government organization in Jordan in

86
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,840
the Middle East there will be like many

87
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:31,150
more cases so the first step is that

88
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,090
they send email with some attachment and

89
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,909
how this attachment looks like how these

90
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,010
documents look like so they've like

91
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,660
different

92
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:43,270
they sent like different documents and

93
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,159
these documents try to impersonate like

94
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,770
organizations from many different

95
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:50,229
countries so here in this list you can

96
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,909
see the list of the countries which have

97
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:55,120
been impersonated so you can see like

98
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,280
many of them and this is the way how the

99
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,680
documents look like so we have like some

100
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,859
text which is like some document which

101
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,400
is blurred so it's like not very clear

102
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,889
who is it or whom or from where it was

103
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,049
taken and in the center of the document

104
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,479
you can see the blue area asking like

105
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:16,330
please enable macros or enable content

106
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,190
so these are the stars of the documents

107
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:21,008
and usually these documents look very

108
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,740
similar like this one is targeting like

109
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:26,530
Republic of Azerbaijan like Ministry of

110
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:29,229
Internal Affairs Republic of Arjun

111
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:32,229
Azerbaijan this one is impersonating

112
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:35,289
like some other different organizations

113
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,008
from different countries usually from

114
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:38,500
the middle-east

115
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:41,199
this one impersonates National Assembly

116
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,889
of Pakistan this one this is something

117
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,800
in Turkish in this another case it used

118
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:51,729
to look or it use it look it try to

119
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,889
appear like some CV like for some job

120
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:56,258
application this one was quite

121
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:59,199
interesting it was sent to some

122
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:01,240
organizations in Turkey after there's

123
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,719
been some problems or some decisions

124
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,539
like not buying this f-35 fighters so

125
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:10,750
there will be some kind of like problems

126
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:15,750
like that and they've used this

127
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:22,120
opportunity to make the to try to spread

128
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:25,630
the malicious malware - so what will

129
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,550
happen after the victim enables the

130
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,590
macros so they are like there have been

131
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,020
like many like different delivery

132
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,568
methods and this has been like changing

133
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,310
all the time so here in this slide I try

134
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:39,069
to summarize what happened so in the

135
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:42,460
left you can see the year and month and

136
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:45,219
on the right you can see like the

137
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,650
different like the evolution of of the

138
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:49,719
malware itself or of the dropper of the

139
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,388
malware so it always starts with macro

140
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:55,779
with some short exception of template

141
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:59,220
injections like in the April of 2019 and

142
00:06:55,779 --> 00:07:01,960
then this macro usually drops some files

143
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,569
they're usually script like visual basic

144
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,020
straight and JavaScript

145
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:10,180
sometimes binary files and then it was

146
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:14,169
some decoding there somewhere some

147
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:17,440
process inject it decode to some partial

148
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:19,568
backdoor which is the custom

149
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,300
implementing backdoor and he'll be like

150
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:24,849
several different versions if you I do

151
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,580
the visualization and this kind of

152
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:29,949
schematics of one of their campaign from

153
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,830
November 2018 so you've demolicious

154
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:36,159
makarov it dropped some files in this

155
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,870
case it imports some register data into

156
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:39,669
the registry which establishes the

157
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,490
persistence so it gets run on the

158
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:45,219
startup then this dll file runs an

159
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:49,720
obfuscated PowerShell code which after

160
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:53,169
the obfuscation like connect to the CNC

161
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,770
server in another case again from

162
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:58,299
November 2018 which I will do in this

163
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:00,128
schematics so you download some

164
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,169
PowerShell code it drops like three

165
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:04,630
different files the first visual basic

166
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:08,380
code runs JavaScript obfuscated code

167
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:11,050
which decodes and runs base 52 encoding

168
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:14,319
code which becomes partial backdoor

169
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:16,840
which then connects to C&C server one

170
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,930
more delivery method between found where

171
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:23,109
the Trojan iced tea jens so there is the

172
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,569
known tool called burp suite and we

173
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,789
found a gen written in java and this ki

174
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:30,069
general trojan i so you can see the

175
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:30,520
highlighted lines that after running the

176
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:34,180
kitchen

177
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:37,978
it dropped some files and it was like

178
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:42,399
one of these like muddy water reactors

179
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:44,320
back doors before i mentioned like base

180
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,570
52 encoding which is like very untypical

181
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,329
for protectors they usually use like

182
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:52,029
typical like base 64 but in this case we

183
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:53,739
found base 52 and with with untypical

184
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:55,779
alphabet you can see in the in the

185
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,450
center of the screenshot there is the

186
00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:01,810
long string strand starting with a left

187
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:04,839
bracket right bracket star plus minus

188
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:07,239
numbers letters and this is the this is

189
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:11,370
the alphabet it has 52 characters and

190
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,770
this is the way for very how they end

191
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,600
they're pay loans so we mentioned this

192
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,670
is like in the block poll in one blog

193
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,460
post it was like almost like one year

194
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:23,370
ago and after that we noticed that they

195
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,100
changed a little bit which we have

196
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:29,310
noticed some instances when where this

197
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,500
alphabet was short like base fortify

198
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,599
base for the eighth base forty so it

199
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,910
seems that this red actor is like a

200
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,100
reading they're like they're looking

201
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:42,000
online like who publishes what about

202
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:44,460
them and they just change their malware

203
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,560
based on this or make some changes so

204
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,140
now let's talk about these backdoors and

205
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,959
post exploitation tools so the main

206
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,930
backdoor which they have been using for

207
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,640
most of the last year and since the

208
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,729
beginning basically so for most of the

209
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,230
time it was called power stats

210
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,900
it's like standard backdoor with the

211
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:07,140
main functions for downloading uploading

212
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,790
files taking screenshots and so on the

213
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,949
interesting is the screenshot in there

214
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:14,189
in the middle that there is like one

215
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:16,440
command called Madi and this this is the

216
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,089
way why this trajectory was called by

217
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,160
the research is like muddy water because

218
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:22,080
like it's like one command which they

219
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,699
sent from C&C server struck starting

220
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:29,520
with this keyword and then executing the

221
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:31,380
command after the muddy text so this

222
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,470
power starts backdoor is written in

223
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,720
PowerShell so it's not that difficult to

224
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,790
analyze it but there is lots of

225
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,020
applications are like many layers of

226
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:46,199
obfuscation so you have like in some

227
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:48,240
cases even 10 20 30 50 layers of

228
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,250
obfuscation so it takes some time just

229
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,640
to remove all these obfuscation until we

230
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:55,020
get the code of the backdoor itself and

231
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,279
these are the techniques used for the

232
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,130
sophistication so it's like basically

233
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:01,500
different techniques like basically for

234
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,839
zip compression invoked expression

235
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:08,760
commands and so on some randomized named

236
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:12,779
functions and so on this backdoor

237
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:15,270
communicates with C&C server it creates

238
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:17,580
like JSON object it encourage them and

239
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:19,890
sends them to CNC servers and this is

240
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,680
the way how communication is done and

241
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,420
it's always it's not done directly to

242
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,329
CNC servers but it's done through

243
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,750
proxies and this is the message what I

244
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:34,230
got like in one case when I for some

245
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:36,149
reason I patched the backdoor and it

246
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,700
didn't encrypt the code so I send them

247
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:40,620
the data and the responses here you can

248
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,360
see in the screenshot stop I kill you

249
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,149
researcher so this is probably like

250
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,920
another case when I noticed that they're

251
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:50,490
like monitoring like what's going on and

252
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,800
they try to see like which researchers

253
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:56,250
try to track them and what they try to

254
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,979
do so after the first backdoor we notice

255
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,529
like different backdoor pull out stats

256
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:05,010
we just might interesting because it

257
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:06,930
uses Dropbox for like the communications

258
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:10,069
so they upload like some file to the

259
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:12,510
Dropbox the backdoor downloads it

260
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:15,420
executes the command and approach the

261
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:17,360
result back to the Dropbox and you can

262
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,310
see there like some some different

263
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,230
extensions of the files so for example

264
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,239
if the file is drak it's like the

265
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:27,540
registration information which is sent

266
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:31,200
from victim to the C&C server dot CMD

267
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:33,810
malware of botnet operator upload to

268
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,770
Dropbox and victim machine downloads it

269
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:39,540
executes it and dr. wrist result is the

270
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,089
result of the command which is again

271
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,310
uploaded to the cloud it was quite

272
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:47,970
interesting and of course they have the

273
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:50,219
API tokens access tokens and after

274
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,930
reverse engineering you can obtain it

275
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,080
and you can monitor them like what

276
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:59,279
commands are there if they haven't been

277
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,060
deleted then we found like another two

278
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,820
back doors

279
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,079
one was called sharp stats and another

280
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,959
one which would be on another slide

281
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:10,500
called dev stats these big doors were

282
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,599
quite simple they they implemented like

283
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,110
only the basic features for downloading

284
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,100
uploading and running commands and

285
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,790
partially they were written in different

286
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,370
languages like either dotnet or Delfy

287
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:25,349
and some of these routines were done by

288
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:28,560
power shells of some powershell script

289
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:31,270
was dropped executed and result was read

290
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,839
by these backdoors and

291
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:38,350
products to the CNC servers then we've

292
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:41,380
been we noticed version 2 of the power

293
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:44,350
stud back door this was again like

294
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,990
written completely in PowerShell lots of

295
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:51,970
obfuscation basically there was just the

296
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:54,670
simple simple like main function which

297
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:57,370
did like hello message to the server

298
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,529
then get the response like what command

299
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,620
should be executed then it executes the

300
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:07,120
command uploads the result deck and it

301
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:10,089
continues like again and again then

302
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,880
there was like upload update to power

303
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:14,770
start version 3 just again like kind of

304
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,290
similar to the previous case but in in

305
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,089
in this case the basic backdoor

306
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:23,579
implemented only few commands like

307
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:27,010
taking screenshots and running command

308
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:28,930
running running command but then more

309
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,149
functions were implemented in another

310
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,779
stage so the backdoor was split into two

311
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:37,029
stages and the second stage was only

312
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:40,709
like sent to the victim if it was

313
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:43,540
interesting for protectors

314
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:45,699
we also found like except for this

315
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,130
custom backdoors which they wrote by

316
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,839
themselves we found like some of the

317
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,060
framework which are which are like

318
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,130
generally available on github or on

319
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,020
internet and they've been also using

320
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,689
them for in like some of their

321
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:01,600
operations so this include for example

322
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:06,630
an interpreter power sploit quad egg

323
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:09,339
which is like framework in JavaScript

324
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,350
written in JavaScript Empire project

325
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:14,680
also like few more tools like for

326
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:18,160
example assembly maps for mapping SMB

327
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,910
shares credential stealing tools like

328
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,089
mimikatz

329
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,949
or lasagna do often is quite similar you

330
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:26,920
can see the screenshot on the red that

331
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:29,350
they took the lasagna code from github

332
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,589
and they added like one function called

333
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:35,459
intimate dampers not in it but in T

334
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:38,620
there is like a typo and this one

335
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:41,890
include included the function which

336
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:44,440
again dropped the power stuff backdoor

337
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:51,009
it's kind of the similar case like in

338
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:53,050
in the case of betch betch to join which

339
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:55,839
i mentioned in the beginning so they did

340
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:59,529
this kind of patching so now let's

341
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:02,740
continue and look at the malicious

342
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:05,500
android applications so for mobile

343
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:09,160
applications we haven't found much data

344
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,610
just found four samples and if you can

345
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:16,329
see the name of the sample and time

346
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:18,670
timeline on the left so the first and

347
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:20,888
last case like Android Android Jack

348
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,649
they're like kind of the commodity

349
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:26,199
malware which can be downloaded from

350
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:29,110
from Internet and the second and third

351
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:32,050
case where some kind of custom the first

352
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:34,269
one of the custom file stealer using

353
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:37,170
telegram a CNC channel it was like some

354
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:40,230
their custom custom a written malware

355
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:43,660
and there's also like one other case

356
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:45,490
with with kind of traditional CNC

357
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:49,089
communication not using any cloud

358
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:50,829
services or any messengers in this

359
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:53,170
screenshot you can see like for they

360
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:56,620
just for their custom all are there is

361
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:58,509
the class or like my protocol or

362
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,189
application protocol and you can see

363
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:02,259
write a list of features like on the

364
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:04,688
left and on the right so the names on

365
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:07,059
the left can be found in the subset or

366
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:10,289
the subset of all the comments on the on

367
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:14,168
the right but the list is like like

368
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:15,490
extended so it's likely that or it shows

369
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:17,530
that there has been like some

370
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:22,900
development like between the second and

371
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:25,178
third version so as I mentioned before

372
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,250
like we don't know much about these like

373
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:29,830
Android applications but they're like

374
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,230
few either filenames or few metadata

375
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,610
which we managed to collect so the one

376
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,370
of these applications was called like

377
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,979
Afghanistan election of 80s probably

378
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:41,830
targeting someone in Afghanistan in

379
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:45,909
Middle East or South Asia in this area

380
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:47,949
in one other family they contained some

381
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:49,659
IP addresses in Pakistan which they try

382
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,700
to brute-force it there's the brute

383
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:55,450
forcing function like one of the smaller

384
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,930
family was spread via sending SMS

385
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:02,250
messages I will show later screen

386
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:06,600
and one of this sample was distributed

387
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:09,690
from compromised Turkish like nonprofit

388
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,419
research website and here are the

389
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:15,180
screenshots like for sending the SMS is

390
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,670
so the SMS was in Turkish and on the

391
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,940
screenshot below there is the link to

392
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:23,870
some apk file so it it asked the victim

393
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:28,140
just to download and install some

394
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:32,449
malicious mobile application now I'll

395
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:36,210
talk shortly about the false Flags

396
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:38,310
infrastructure and the target so this is

397
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,470
like what would I mention like before

398
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:43,560
that like one of these backdoors had

399
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,790
many layers of application so after they

400
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,220
are skating all of them

401
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,200
we were present with this kind of

402
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,900
messages like this one there is there

403
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,790
some text in simplified Chinese and the

404
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,550
translation was saying like unable to

405
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:59,310
connect to URL please wait for Dragon

406
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:01,560
for some reason so it was some kind of

407
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,260
an error message so they probably try to

408
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,300
you know confuse some I don't know

409
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:09,360
beginner researchers to think that maybe

410
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:12,240
they come from mainland China and try to

411
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,850
target someone or also in the same

412
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,940
sample like one variable with the list

413
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:20,540
of proxy servers again obfuscated but

414
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:23,790
after the obfuscation we got like the

415
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,560
URL addresses the variable was called

416
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:28,860
like a dragon middle like reference into

417
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:32,970
dragon maybe again China in another case

418
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:35,159
and in like few messages in Hebrew there

419
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,990
is like two they were like in the back

420
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,580
door there were two variables which were

421
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,560
not used so they were like totally

422
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,870
useless

423
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:45,240
one was called dollar god the second

424
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:48,149
world dollar s key and over there you

425
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,640
can see the translation if you translate

426
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:53,700
it to the English so there's like one

427
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,040
message was like some kind of quote

428
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,200
which was said but I buy I think the

429
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,330
Israeli Prime Minister like maybe 10 15

430
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,230
years ago and the second one was some

431
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:07,419
kind of like religious message so

432
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:10,480
related to Israel for some reason

433
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:14,080
also another false flag have been

434
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,559
related to Russia or using Cyrillic

435
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:21,490
alphabet so I mentioned that they spread

436
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:23,230
Elmar bulbar using the malicious

437
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,030
documents and these documents can have

438
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:29,980
different metadata so you can see there

439
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:32,230
like there's like message like r2 there

440
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,720
is the name or what is the name of user

441
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:36,640
who created the document and there is

442
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,160
written in Russian like positive RTL

443
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,840
Windows like Windows user or on the

444
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,960
right part

445
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:47,320
there's the creator and Incirlik D issue

446
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,980
IR or another artifact it one document

447
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:53,320
like again it's like see users d hy r /

448
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:57,370
something else so remove like this kind

449
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,950
of false flags but we are sure that they

450
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:02,320
are like false v because it seems that

451
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:05,559
this protector is based like in Middle

452
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,049
East so for the infrastructure this is

453
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:10,059
the list of you know we refound drink

454
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:12,280
the research we've been monitoring them

455
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:14,740
like for maybe one year but for quite

456
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,620
quite a long time and we have seen at

457
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:20,980
least like 37 IP addresses use the CNC

458
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:24,520
servers 4000 plus compromised what

459
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:27,549
WordPress services be not acting as

460
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:32,350
proxies we found like different accounts

461
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:35,020
for service providers for for DNS domain

462
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,250
names for dynamic DNS DNS domain names

463
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:40,510
and so on

464
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:43,630
we also found like some code which was

465
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:46,299
running on the back end as the C&C

466
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:49,210
server and it was the Python script so

467
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:52,690
we just found it to compile it analyzed

468
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:56,350
it so this is how it looked so this was

469
00:21:52,690 --> 00:22:02,260
the application version 1 0-0 running on

470
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:04,990
the back end and these are like a nice

471
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:09,250
ascii art like Maddie C 3

472
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:12,520
and this is the list in the screenshot

473
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:15,429
the list of URLs which it implemented so

474
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:18,220
every time this CNC server was running

475
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:20,500
somewhere and if you connect it to any

476
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,840
of these URL addresses it would like

477
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,080
some results and also mention here that

478
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,629
they use some broken or some weak RSA

479
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,889
implementation so I'll talk a little bit

480
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,920
later in the last section about the

481
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,390
encryption it was not very difficult to

482
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,790
to crack it

483
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:39,520
we also found like new very new version

484
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:42,610
one zero one it's like new ASCII art

485
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:47,020
this time it's like spider and the web

486
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:50,770
in ASCII art and if you see the list of

487
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:53,200
the like implemented URL addresses the

488
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:56,170
last one is called modules so probably

489
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,260
the newer version like implements some

490
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:01,420
modules but we didn't manage to get any

491
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:04,330
so probably we might find it in the

492
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:08,230
future so I took it now I will talk

493
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:11,260
about the targets and victims so who

494
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:14,440
they are so we found out that they have

495
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,690
been like from our you know monitoring

496
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,040
from metadata and the front from like

497
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,370
other sources we found that they have

498
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:24,070
been like 2000 around 2000 + compromised

499
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:26,919
hosts we managed to identify like 60 of

500
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:29,470
them and this is like when we draw it on

501
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,090
the on the map so you can see that

502
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,940
mostly it's like middle eastern

503
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,470
countries so most victims are there and

504
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,800
from these countries like I would say

505
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:41,110
the turkey was the most targeted but

506
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:46,629
also they'll be like 2 cases in in

507
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:49,178
Europe and us so who are the targeted

508
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:52,170
industries so it was like mostly

509
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:54,670
government like maybe 2/3 of the cases

510
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:58,059
telecom a telecommunication and IT

511
00:23:54,670 --> 00:24:00,250
services for another maybe 25% and the

512
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:04,090
results like transportation gaming few

513
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:07,270
NGOs food and media companies when I say

514
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:09,790
government what I mean so it's pretty

515
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:14,290
much every Ministry of government is to

516
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:16,379
finance education interior defense law

517
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:18,770
enforcement agencies

518
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,770
and so on

519
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:26,590
in April twenty nineteen there'd be like

520
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,970
some leaks like someone created the

521
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,429
telegram channel and to this channel

522
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:34,250
they leaked like some information

523
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:36,760
related to not only like muddy water and

524
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:40,840
to also some other predictors

525
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:43,910
we found this leak and this leap

526
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,770
included screenshots which looked like

527
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,530
this one so they have been like muddy

528
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:50,810
see too and it'll be like list of some

529
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:53,660
victims and IP addresses and this

530
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:55,100
information so we looked into the

531
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,740
screenshot and looked also to all

532
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,350
monitoring and we found that you know

533
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,600
there is some overlap that we have

534
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:06,350
information about some of these victims

535
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,959
este has so it seems that so we can say

536
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:11,780
that these screenshots or these these

537
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:16,430
leaks are like legitimate it's not like

538
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:20,240
made-up that we also found the similar

539
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:22,070
results now like for the last part I

540
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,040
will talk about like some of these

541
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:27,350
mistakes which the threaded director did

542
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:30,920
the first one was quite quite

543
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:32,540
interesting because like we analyzed

544
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,780
like these documents as I mention before

545
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:38,740
and in one of these documents there was

546
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:42,620
embedded this screenshot so someone made

547
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:46,010
probably by accident screenshot of his

548
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:48,649
computer and by accident embedded it

549
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:51,440
into this document and we managed to

550
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:54,260
find it so in this screenshot you can

551
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,200
see if I make bigger the the top you can

552
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:00,230
see that there like the second tab

553
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:04,400
import CSV go fish and there is like

554
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:07,040
some letters in Arabic or in Farsi and

555
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,500
the name of the user in this case of

556
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:13,190
score like torque probably third Turkish

557
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:15,470
on targeting to Turkey Arabic letters go

558
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:19,059
fish is some kind of like fishing

559
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:21,820
toolkit it's quite interesting

560
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:24,010
second second thing like I mentioned

561
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:27,039
that they used a lots of lots of proxies

562
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:29,440
so the the whole thing looked like this

563
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,210
that there are some compromised proxy or

564
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,480
the attacker victim and the

565
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:37,090
communication was done through these

566
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,890
proxies and only when the with the

567
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:40,870
machine was instructed to upload some

568
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:43,360
files they were not uploaded to the

569
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:45,399
compromised proxy but to their final CNC

570
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,590
server but these proxies were not

571
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:51,340
controlled by the attackers

572
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:53,470
so sometimes we found something like

573
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,350
that like there was the proxy and there

574
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:58,780
were like several files some of them had

575
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:01,840
the length 0 but some of them had some

576
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:04,178
content and they were not clean like not

577
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,610
deleted and after we looked into these

578
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:08,890
files with the receiver the hashes we

579
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:10,870
could found like you can see in the

580
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:15,100
upper screenshot that there is like the

581
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:18,689
command with some IP address port slash

582
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:23,289
HT a so basically this corresponds the

583
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:26,169
the path as we found a sign mentioned in

584
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:27,280
the C&C server I mean in this sense II

585
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:30,340
CNC beckoned

586
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:33,010
so we found through this like several of

587
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:36,220
these CNC addresses or the second

588
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:40,179
screenshot there is like base64 encoded

589
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:41,799
command which after decoding again asks

590
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:45,039
for some get command to download like

591
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:47,908
some some data from the server and

592
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,908
execute it

593
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:54,679
I mentioned that there has been like the

594
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,149
encryption and this is how the encrypted

595
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:58,639
traffic looked like that there have been

596
00:27:56,149 --> 00:28:01,639
lots of numbers and they had over like

597
00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:04,939
three digits like only three digit

598
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:09,049
numbers space and another three digit

599
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:11,960
number and after reverse engineering we

600
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:15,529
found that these were the prime numbers

601
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,669
used for encryption for RSA you can see

602
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:21,139
it's like very small

603
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:24,559
for example 959 is the prime or 713 so

604
00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:27,859
like four so if the prime number is very

605
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,960
big the factoring or factorization takes

606
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:32,928
lots of time but in this case it's very

607
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,119
simple to find the P and Q and you can

608
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:37,909
basically compute like everything and

609
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,809
crack the encryption get the key and

610
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:42,080
decrypt it

611
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:44,450
so the code below can become something

612
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,879
like this so in this encrypted data

613
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:49,729
which we like download it like from some

614
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:52,279
of these like open proxies we could see

615
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:56,059
like the machine name we can see the

616
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:58,999
hard disk hydride information IP address

617
00:28:56,059 --> 00:29:02,239
name of the computer name of the user

618
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:04,789
for example and we could do it like for

619
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:08,440
for more victims so this is the way how

620
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:12,019
we could know like who was the victim

621
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,659
also like one more mistake are the open

622
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:16,609
directories so sometimes you go to the

623
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:19,269
directory and there are lots of files I

624
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:21,408
just download everything and analyze it

625
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:22,849
sometimes it's very simple like not all

626
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:24,649
the time but these are like few

627
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:28,939
screenshots which is nice for

628
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:30,918
researchers like before I mentioned like

629
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,139
there is like one one Moore's like

630
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:36,200
smaller mistake I mentioned then they

631
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:38,599
use telegram and for the telegram

632
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,599
channel you have some metadata and if

633
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:44,539
you see this language code you can see

634
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:47,239
that there's like FA which is like Farsi

635
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:49,580
language which is spoken I think in Iran

636
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:52,009
or somewhere so of course it can be it

637
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,720
can be false flag but it can also be the

638
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:56,359
information which can give us the hint

639
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,309
like where the protector is from because

640
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:59,610
they forgot to change it to English for

641
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:03,190
example

642
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:05,678
yeah so this is basically all like for

643
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:07,929
for which I present for my research out

644
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,539
I'd like to also mention like view or

645
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:12,730
show screen shows like few blog posts

646
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:15,399
which I found because for us as

647
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:17,200
researchers we usually don't do or we

648
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:20,110
should not do any attribution it's like

649
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,710
not our job anymore mainly research like

650
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,658
how the model works and how how the

651
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:28,840
malware is spread and how it functions

652
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:32,049
but during this research we managed to

653
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,510
find like some individuals or some some

654
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:38,918
emails which might lead to some

655
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:40,360
individuals and if you if you look at if

656
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:42,010
you look at for the information they'll

657
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,189
be like different blog posts one was

658
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:47,919
called one word from group I be called

659
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:50,080
like move mutiny ago day it's like one

660
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,690
blog post like in exposing some

661
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,840
individuals another one one ICN a

662
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,789
Iranian cyber news agency they again

663
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,779
mentioned like some of these links or

664
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:04,210
one link 0xffff something blog muddy

665
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:06,490
water cyber spies like some I think

666
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:08,200
Chinese researcher and they went even

667
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,659
like farther they even like exposed

668
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,390
these people or the person who might be

669
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:15,070
behind which might be true but it can

670
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:18,940
also be false flag so we have to be very

671
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:21,820
careful to this and now I see that my

672
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:24,820
time run up so if you have any question

673
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:28,350
now or later I'll be happy to answer it

674
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,350
so that's all for me

675
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:15,840
[Music]

676
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:16,470
it's difficult to say like they in this

677
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,570
channel

678
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:21,660
they draw or they leak information about

679
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:24,780
both of them so they might be related

680
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:28,020
like I don't know and it's like very

681
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:30,120
very very difficult to say like I am I

682
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,750
prefer not to do any attribution but

683
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:45,199
they might be related

684
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:45,200
it's like difficult to say for me so ask

685
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:51,200
you can ask more

686
00:32:56,149 --> 00:33:02,758
maybe there's just Google to translate

687
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:05,158
it I don't know I think there's this

688
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,589
Hebrew if you just take exactly this

689
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:10,709
message and put it to Google you find

690
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:12,119
find the Wikipedia webpage with these

691
00:33:10,709 --> 00:33:15,889
quotes so danger I think they just

692
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:15,889
google it and just copy paste it there

693
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:29,009
yes they did target a lot Turkey and I

694
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:31,289
think to to me to me these Russian

695
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:33,829
letters don't make sense either but

696
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:36,389
maybe they just install some some

697
00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:38,249
virtual machine with Russian language

698
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:40,139
they just you know keep their some

699
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:42,209
metadata and maybe try to school

700
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:44,789
researchers it can be like one

701
00:33:42,209 --> 00:33:46,829
explanation again like I don't know

702
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:48,179
these are false Flags so they can if

703
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:50,450
they are careful they can put their

704
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:50,450
anything

705
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:02,440
which one was it edited evict because

706
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:04,060
the guy whom they mentioned I think he

707
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,190
complained or something like that but

708
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:09,580
that's why I don't like to do any

709
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:11,440
attribution i I prefer to research like

710
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:15,489
how to malware work how they spread it

711
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:19,830
but who is behind like I've no way to to

712
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:19,830
find it out so I prefer to avoid it

713
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:53,990
you
