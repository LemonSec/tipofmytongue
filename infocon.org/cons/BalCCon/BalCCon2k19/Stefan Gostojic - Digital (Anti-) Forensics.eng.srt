1
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:32,300
hello everyone today we will listen

2
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:35,220
about the big digital antes forensics

3
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:39,980
forum presenter of Stephen God's stage

4
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,980
from the Faculty of technical sciences

5
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:51,870
okay hi I'm glad to be here as you had

6
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,390
an opportunity to hear my name is

7
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,360
Stephen ostrich and I'm going to talk

8
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,390
about digital forensics and digital

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,349
audio forensics before coming to the

10
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,299
point I will briefly introduce myself my

11
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,759
work is on associate professor at

12
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,260
Faculty of technical sciences in Morris

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,930
odd there

14
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,159
I had newly founded digital forensics

15
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:20,760
lab I'm also participating in a research

16
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,729
project that expose how artificial

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,539
intelligence can be applied to digital

18
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:30,000
forensics and I'm preparing a course on

19
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:33,270
digital forensics that is supposed to

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,539
start in the next academic year I'm also

21
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:40,408
working as a court-appointed IT expert

22
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:44,159
witness in my own capacity and roughly

23
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:48,990
the half of the cases I took were

24
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:52,950
digital forensic cases this talk is

25
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,079
going to cover several topics I'm in the

26
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,560
beginning going to tell you that this is

27
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,829
going to be an introductory talk and see

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,850
since I see a lot of young people here I

29
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:09,929
think that I haven't made a mistake when

30
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:13,160
I prepared the electro after general

31
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:17,010
introduction in forensics in general and

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:20,670
digital forensics I'm going to cover

33
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:23,940
some of the methods and tools using

34
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:27,869
computer forensics network forensics and

35
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:31,109
mobile forensics as the main areas of

36
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:35,069
detail of forensics I'm going to talk

37
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:38,780
about some anti forensic methods

38
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:43,488
and after giving giving some examples

39
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:47,150
I'm going to conclude the talk with some

40
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:52,230
references that you can follow later on

41
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:55,709
so to begin one simple definition of

42
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:58,980
forensics is that is a scientific

43
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:01,590
analysis of physical evidence for

44
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:06,179
example evidence that can be found at a

45
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:09,349
crime scene so I have a question for

46
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:13,370
anyone in the ordinary audience waters

47
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:13,369
scientific analysis means

48
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:23,890
can you try to answer that question so

49
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,739
that basically means that we have to

50
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:30,190
follow the scientific method we have to

51
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:33,280
put some hypotheses and then test that

52
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,920
hypothesis using accepted scientific

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,490
methods a little bit more detailed

54
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,929
definition would say that digital file

55
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:46,260
or forensics in general is a process of

56
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:50,110
identifying acquiring preserving

57
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:53,429
analyzing and presenting evidence using

58
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:57,040
scientifically and legally sound methods

59
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:01,260
so we can we can see that forensic

60
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:04,679
process has several phases or steps and

61
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,450
that each activity has to be

62
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,019
scientifically sound and what is even

63
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,630
more important it has to be legally

64
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:15,880
sound if we do not do not follow the

65
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,070
book then those evidence won't be

66
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:22,240
accepted by the court

67
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:25,450
so I mentioned another commonly used

68
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,710
term evidence in general it is something

69
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:32,320
that supports an assertion but legally

70
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,719
speaking it is something legally

71
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,349
submitted to a court to ascertain the

72
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,440
truth of some of the matter so can you

73
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,830
give you some examples of evidence in

74
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,830
general

75
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:52,710
okay and that is the first example I'm

76
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:56,789
going to give you later on but before

77
00:04:52,710 --> 00:05:01,198
that I just want to mention that we

78
00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:03,150
usually want to answer so-called the six

79
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,509
weeks of Investigation

80
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:10,198
during forensic investigation and as

81
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:14,159
you'll be able to see very soon not all

82
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:17,370
those questions start with W so we want

83
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:20,180
to answer the what question what

84
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:25,409
happened who did it

85
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:29,430
why did happen where did happen when did

86
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:35,819
happen and how did it happen and we have

87
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:38,370
yet to take that in mind later on so the

88
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:40,740
Streif history of forensics many people

89
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:44,249
think that it is a new relatively new

90
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:47,969
professional discipline but as early as

91
00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:49,680
in the 20th century Asian ancient

92
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:53,339
Chinese were the first to distinguish

93
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,319
between natural debt and criminal intent

94
00:05:53,339 --> 00:06:00,150
in suffocating rictus

95
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:03,180
what is more familiar to most of the

96
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:07,560
people is some other branches of

97
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:09,629
forensics for example in 1835 henry god

98
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,210
are not sure that i pronounced the

99
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:15,810
English surname correctly became the

100
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:18,899
first person to use physical analysis to

101
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:24,089
compare a bullet with the murder weapon

102
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:26,719
and also in the 19th century Sir Edward

103
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:28,889
Henry developed a system for classifying

104
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:31,949
fingerprints that was used in criminal

105
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:35,430
instigations he was not the first who

106
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:39,330
let's say invented fingerprints but his

107
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:42,080
method was most widely used I'm aware

108
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:47,210
this is all okay and now in the beer

109
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:51,448
let's say skipping one century in 1987

110
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:56,159
the first case went to a trial using DNA

111
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:57,520
evidence and one man was acquitted from

112
00:06:56,159 --> 00:07:01,080
raping murder

113
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,210
using that evidence I'm aware this is an

114
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,639
international conference but I want to

115
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:10,419
say something about history of forensics

116
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,460
in Serbia most of the people from Serbia

117
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:16,030
heard of Archibald rice

118
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:18,960
he was the first forensic petitioner in

119
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:21,429
Serbia and he was also the first

120
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,549
principal of the first first political

121
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:30,610
academy in the country some one century

122
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:34,900
ago so this is also my first example we

123
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:38,530
all know that each person has individual

124
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:42,219
fingerprints and when we touch some

125
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:45,840
object for example a murder weapon we

126
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:50,259
leave those fingerprints on the object

127
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,448
during the forensic investigation that

128
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:56,889
investigation passes through several

129
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:59,500
phases for example if you are examining

130
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:03,099
the fingerprints first we have to

131
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,289
identify the evidence and that is not

132
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:07,659
something that is is easily done because

133
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:10,780
we usually cannot see fingerprints with

134
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:14,460
our bare eyes so we have to apply a

135
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:19,059
powder or spray to see the fingerprints

136
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:21,849
then we have to acquire the evidence for

137
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:25,770
example using the oldest technique we

138
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:29,430
can use a transparent tape to leave the

139
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:32,078
fingerprints of the murder weapon and

140
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:35,799
then we have to preserve the evidence

141
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:40,270
for example by scanning that tape later

142
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:42,899
on the evidence is analyzed in the past

143
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:46,329
people had to manually compare

144
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:49,480
fingerprints with police records but now

145
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:53,290
that can be done automatically in few

146
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,750
seconds using software methods and

147
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:58,719
finally the evidence has to be presented

148
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:01,899
to the court that means that the

149
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:06,490
examiner has to give a written and an

150
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:09,670
oral report to the court so the second

151
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:12,010
example could be DNA

152
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:15,370
let's suppose that in the same case a

153
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:18,490
murderer left secret but at a crime

154
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:21,100
scene so we have to pass through the

155
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:24,910
same phases first we have to identify

156
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,830
the evidence compared to the first case

157
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:31,420
it is much simple because they can see

158
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:34,900
their signal by but with our eyes we

159
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:40,209
have to acquire the biological material

160
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:43,140
from the secret but we have preserved by

161
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:46,660
Oracle material that is not as easy as

162
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:49,930
preserving the fingerprint then we

163
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:53,439
analyze the biological material by

164
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:56,920
extracting DNA and finding a match in

165
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,990
the database and similarly to the

166
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,380
previous case we have to present the

167
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:05,710
evidence to the court so now I'm now I'm

168
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:08,020
coming to anti forensics we could say

169
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,660
that anti forensics is a process of

170
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:15,340
compromising digital forensic methods

171
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:17,709
and tools for example what would be some

172
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,310
anti forensic method in our first

173
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,310
example

174
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:31,020
I can't read it he'll just be a little

175
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,020
bit more louder

176
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:40,760
well that could be a method but we could

177
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:44,700
also use for examples for example

178
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:47,939
elastics gloves and they won't leave

179
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:53,550
fingerprints in the first case and for

180
00:10:47,940 --> 00:11:00,030
the next example the DNA evidence what

181
00:10:53,550 --> 00:11:05,010
could be well that is an option we can

182
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:07,949
we can stop smoking but what eternal it

183
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:11,189
turns out that it is not as easy not to

184
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:13,320
leave biological traces as fingerprints

185
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,760
so that is this is much more complex

186
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:20,310
thing to do so now we are coming to

187
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:24,240
digital forensics and digital forensics

188
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:28,410
is a special case of forensics in

189
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,640
general so we could say that it is a

190
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:34,730
process of identifying collecting

191
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,350
preserving analyzing and presenting

192
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:40,320
digital evidence using scientifically

193
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:44,070
very sound methods and tools so the

194
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:47,150
focus is on digital evidence what is

195
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,150
digital evidence

196
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:59,639
okay different kind of artifacts files

197
00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:03,819
logs laptops or to be more specific

198
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:06,339
solid-state drives in laptops etc but in

199
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:09,819
general it is information of probate

200
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:13,179
value information which can be used in

201
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:16,169
court that is sold or transmitted in

202
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:20,139
digital form

203
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:23,649
there are several digital forensic

204
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:26,399
principles and most of those principle

205
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:30,039
can also apply to any kind of forensic

206
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:33,100
investigation the first principle was

207
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:35,679
already mentioned and it says that we

208
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,399
have to use scientific and scientific

209
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:42,189
accepted method and tools

210
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:46,239
the second principle says that we have

211
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:47,829
strictly to follow rules of that means

212
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:50,859
that if you are a forensic investigator

213
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:56,410
you also have to know the law if you

214
00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:59,049
made a simple mistake for example you

215
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:02,108
you forget forgot to invite someone to

216
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:06,009
be presented investigation that evidence

217
00:13:02,109 --> 00:13:08,379
won't be valid at court we have to

218
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:11,529
maintain chain of custody that basically

219
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:14,309
means that there has to be a record

220
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:15,850
where evidence was at each particular

221
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:20,079
moment in time

222
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:24,009
so no one unauthorized could interfere

223
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:26,079
with evidence and the investigation

224
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:29,079
process has to be documented

225
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:32,589
I mentioned scientific method few slides

226
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:35,138
before the idea is that another party

227
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:38,350
for example another forensic examiner

228
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:43,419
can repeat the same process it get

229
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:46,689
exactly the same results and the last

230
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:51,699
principle says that this should not

231
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:54,969
alter data on any medium however there

232
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:59,498
might be some exceptions and I I'll come

233
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:03,520
to those exceptions later oil so we also

234
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:06,850
we already mentioned five phases

235
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,920
forensic investigation and I'm going to

236
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:12,450
give some example of those phases the

237
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:16,540
phases in digital forensic settings

238
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:19,150
first we have to identify digital

239
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:23,290
evidence that is not as easy as

240
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:26,500
identifying cigarette butts can anyone

241
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:30,150
of you give some examples what can be

242
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:35,110
digital evidence we already heard citing

243
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:37,530
some mentioned log files but usually

244
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:41,820
when we come to came to the crime scene

245
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,819
we're going to notice something else

246
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:59,120
you said memory dump pocket but first we

247
00:14:52,460 --> 00:15:01,720
have to get the memory dump so usually

248
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:07,370
we're going to notice some devices

249
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:12,620
laptops smartphones or some Miglia thumb

250
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:17,800
drives SIM cards whatever and for

251
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:20,960
example that could be hardest drive in a

252
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:25,130
some desktop computer etiquette and the

253
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:31,279
crime scene then we have to acquire the

254
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:34,430
evidence and do you have any idea how

255
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:40,880
can we acquire evidence from those

256
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:44,949
devices for example if we found thumb

257
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:48,370
drive or how this drive translates in

258
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,370
what can we do

259
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,810
what

260
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:03,200
well that is true we usually know what

261
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,750
are we looking for but sometimes we

262
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,240
don't so if I heard correctly someone

263
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,040
said that we can boot up device and look

264
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,490
at the files

265
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:18,020
am I correct okay we can do that and

266
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:21,050
people sometimes do that but as it turns

267
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:23,300
out that can invalidate the legal

268
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:26,170
validity of evidence in court

269
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,170
I don't know why exactly

270
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:37,070
so we can use special software or harder

271
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:41,000
tools to be sure that you're not going

272
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:45,050
to alter the data we'll come back to

273
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,770
those tools later on we have to preserve

274
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:53,150
the evidence compared to some other

275
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:56,630
evidence type that is not as hard but we

276
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:59,290
have to take care of protecting that

277
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:02,540
evidence using physical technical and

278
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:04,990
organizational controls evidence digital

279
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:09,200
evidence just a piece of information as

280
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:12,890
any other information resource it has to

281
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:15,740
be protected we have to keep chain of

282
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:18,370
custody and what what can also be

283
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:22,160
interesting is that some physical media

284
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:26,169
degenerate over time so if we have some

285
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:29,780
court case the class for many years

286
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:33,500
compare discs or hadees drives maybe

287
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,750
won't be readable anymore maybe you can

288
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:40,250
try to I know there's a lot of young

289
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:42,380
people but if you used burn CDs 10 or 15

290
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:46,780
years ago it's very high probability

291
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,780
that those CDs won't be readable now

292
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:56,840
so now we acquired and preserved

293
00:17:53,010 --> 00:18:01,890
evidence we have to analyze the Erika's

294
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:04,918
well this face can really very very

295
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,370
because it depends what are we looking

296
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,700
for

297
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:11,820
and it depends on the task there are

298
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:16,620
many special tools which can be used to

299
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:20,460
analyze digital evidence those tools can

300
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:24,330
be either commercial open source or you

301
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:27,409
can even write your own tools I'm a

302
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:32,850
supporter of open source software

303
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:36,029
however in digital forensics commercial

304
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:40,289
tools are much more powerful powerful

305
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:43,549
than open source ones and at the end we

306
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:46,950
have to present that evidence as

307
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:51,770
previously said basically you have to

308
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:56,730
give a written and oral report and maybe

309
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:59,730
answer some questions at court so what

310
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:03,870
is the main function of digital forensic

311
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:07,080
investigations in all the examples I

312
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:10,529
used previously I was talking about some

313
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:13,850
criminal proceedings someone committed a

314
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:16,710
crime and we investigated what happened

315
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:19,980
but that might not be the only reason

316
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:23,899
why we're using digital forensic methods

317
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:27,419
it can be also used in civil proceedings

318
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:30,600
there is a related discipline called

319
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:33,419
called a discovery or electronic

320
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,178
discovery which is concerned with

321
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:39,080
collecting evidence that can be used in

322
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:42,330
court and we have some other suggestions

323
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:45,629
of why would we use digital forensic

324
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:48,539
methods we can for example opportunity

325
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:51,289
to heal this today in one of the

326
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,289
previous lectures

327
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,370
we don't need to collect evidence that

328
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,920
is going to be presented at court for

329
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:09,760
example we can also practice digital

330
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,530
forensics is some commercial settings

331
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,920
for example during incident response

332
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:18,950
then something happens we usually want

333
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:22,730
to know what happened we want to answer

334
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:26,360
to those six v's of investigation in

335
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:28,280
order to stop the intrusion and to make

336
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:31,909
sure that similar attacks don't happen

337
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:34,160
anymore and you can also help helping

338
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:37,460
some military national security settings

339
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:41,060
those investigations are rather similar

340
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:44,390
with criminal investigation except you

341
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:48,409
don't have to take care of legal

342
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:50,780
restrictions as much as previously so

343
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:56,000
digital forensic forensics can be

344
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:59,120
divided in several areas the traditional

345
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,990
digital forensics is called computer

346
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:06,169
forensics and it can be divided into

347
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,030
disk forensics you can you can guess

348
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:13,390
water artifacts that we are

349
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:17,530
investigating disks file systems files

350
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:20,740
memory forensics we are investigating

351
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:24,040
artifacts panda volatile memory

352
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:27,860
operation system forensics

353
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:32,139
investigating log files ready in case of

354
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:39,979
in those cache files document forensics

355
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:42,710
or database forensics in the last decade

356
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:45,620
or two Internet forensics also became

357
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:51,610
popular because most of the people are

358
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:53,989
using pcs to communicate and another

359
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:57,889
traditional branch of digital forensics

360
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:02,840
is Network forensics that is concerned

361
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:06,890
with data in transit recently mobile

362
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:10,490
forensics also became you all know that

363
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:14,840
mobile devices are basically

364
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:17,270
more computers but they are specific so

365
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,230
we have to use some specific methods and

366
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:24,950
tools that are going to explain later on

367
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:28,550
there's also multimedia forensics so we

368
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:33,320
can investigate images audio and video

369
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:35,480
and apart from investigated metadata we

370
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,760
also have to investigate the content

371
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,330
which means that we have to use image

372
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,580
audio and video processing methods and

373
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:47,120
tools and also though there's some

374
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:51,590
exotic drinks exotic things such as IOT

375
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:54,309
and medicine systems etc so there's some

376
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:57,980
commercial tools available available

377
00:22:54,309 --> 00:23:02,178
most well-known commercial tools used

378
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:06,170
for computer forensics are encase by

379
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:09,500
open text and forensic toolkit by data

380
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:13,220
access there are a lot of tools which

381
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:16,370
can be used for mobile forensics I'm

382
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:19,610
going to mention just a few it can be a

383
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,870
mess a big field oxygen forensic

384
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:25,939
detective or

385
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:30,709
cellebrite you FEV there also some open

386
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:34,220
source tools available the most widely

387
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:38,300
used tool used for disk forensics is

388
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:40,520
auto autopsy plus that lets say the

389
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:44,690
front end to the slaughter kit which is

390
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:48,139
a collection of forensic tools the tool

391
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:52,400
that can be used to investigate volatile

392
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:54,800
memory is volatility and nature can be

393
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,460
used with both shark or any other

394
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:03,490
network sniffer what is interesting to

395
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:06,020
notice is that you can boot Kali Linux

396
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,540
values penetration testing tool in

397
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:11,120
forensic mode and most of those who

398
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,178
actually all of those tools and many

399
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:18,469
other forensic tools will be available

400
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:21,860
to you so now we are coming to computer

401
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:24,760
forensics I already explained that

402
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:27,070
computer forensics or so

403
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,260
digital forensics is the area of

404
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:32,980
forensics concerned with evidence stored

405
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:34,780
on traditional computers and by

406
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:38,080
traditional computers

407
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:43,270
I think of laptops desktop computers

408
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:48,760
servers or etc so basically every device

409
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:52,360
that has hard drive or solid SATA drive

410
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,629
that we can take out or any device then

411
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:59,199
we could take memory dump using

412
00:24:54,630 --> 00:25:01,930
specialized tools on thumb drives this

413
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,260
is the oldest area of digital forensics

414
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:09,000
and that means that there are many tools

415
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:13,060
available so we're now coming to another

416
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,520
example and this is really computing 101

417
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:20,530
we have to remind ourselves how hard

418
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:23,200
disks work every hard disk has one or

419
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:26,220
more letters with recovered lead

420
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:30,760
magnetic material that stores data and

421
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:36,100
they also have a shed on an actuator

422
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:40,450
that can move laterally so each side of

423
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:44,620
the vector has a track and we can switch

424
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:48,220
tracks by moving the head and one part

425
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:52,050
of the track is called sector sectors

426
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:54,460
are usually half of kilobyte mark and

427
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:58,899
because of some performance

428
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:01,300
optimizations usually data is not stored

429
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:04,840
on a single sector which is physically

430
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:08,230
the smallest addressable unit but also

431
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:13,270
something that is called block that can

432
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:17,490
take more than one sector and if we also

433
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:21,879
remind ourselves how file systems work

434
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:26,440
we can see that each file is described

435
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:30,400
in directory entry that contains file

436
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:33,970
metadata and a pointer to the first

437
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,500
block that contains data itself of

438
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:40,400
course each file can

439
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:42,290
contain more than one block and first

440
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,560
block contains pointer to the next book

441
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:48,740
etc it leaves in the case of fat

442
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:51,610
filesystem so what happens with we

443
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,610
delete file

444
00:26:54,750 --> 00:27:03,050
what would Windows do in this case well

445
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,990
basic it is going to delete delete only

446
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:11,639
directory entry which means that the

447
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:16,380
data itself is still on hard drive and

448
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:19,650
it becomes so-called empty space also

449
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:24,300
what is important to notice is that file

450
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:27,410
sizes are usually not products of block

451
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:31,590
size which means that that last block

452
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:35,640
stays unused a part of it stays unused

453
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:38,520
and that is called slag space and we are

454
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,970
going to come to that later so for

455
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:46,560
example if you want to search for some

456
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:49,710
data' on computer we acquired data using

457
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:53,429
forensically sound methods and we have

458
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:57,390
to use some pool of to find for example

459
00:27:53,430 --> 00:28:01,530
some piece of text if the file is not

460
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:04,530
deleted that is a simple thing to do we

461
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:07,320
can use some for example and you know

462
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:09,690
find Linux command or whatever to find

463
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:17,280
the data what happens in the file is

464
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:19,710
deleted can you fight the data well we

465
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,430
can there are some special tools and our

466
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:25,830
oh I already mentioned some of them we

467
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:29,550
can either use for example encase or

468
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:32,399
Oto's autopsy to find that data some I'm

469
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:34,409
I'm coming to some specific forensic

470
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,980
tools

471
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:41,940
this device is calling forensic imager

472
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:44,640
it is basically a small computer that

473
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:48,120
cop is data from one hard disk drive or

474
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,760
solid-state drive to another it is

475
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:54,469
specific because it has support for

476
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:58,980
different harder interfaces and

477
00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:01,530
interfaces on one side are right blocked

478
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:05,970
which means that these device cannot

479
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:10,740
alter data on the source drives in

480
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:16,990
it can either copy drive block-by-block

481
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:19,150
ETA he ASO limiters and calculate some

482
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:23,830
cash values that are used today to

483
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:28,060
verify the integrity of the data usually

484
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:31,290
the data is copied on to disks at the

485
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:33,879
same time because one disk is used for

486
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:36,370
investigation and the other disk can be

487
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:40,030
used as a source disk if something goes

488
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:45,129
wrong with the first one this little bit

489
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:47,340
simpler device it is called right that

490
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:51,640
is device that you can put on your

491
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:54,760
desktop PC and as you can see you can

492
00:29:51,640 --> 00:30:01,240
see different hardware interfaces which

493
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:04,540
are very similar to ID USB essential

494
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:08,410
interfaces but they also had the

495
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:10,870
disabled writing on the device so if

496
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,700
you're using that kind of device then

497
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:16,060
you're sure you are not going to alter

498
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,050
the original evidence they're all so

499
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:19,510
simple

500
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:22,960
right occurs which are used for

501
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:26,110
particular hardware interface but this

502
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,190
one is as you can see cover more than

503
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,540
one interface

504
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:34,870
we already said that we can use either

505
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:37,629
commercial or open-source to conduct

506
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:42,939
investigation for example to find some

507
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:47,040
piece of information on the drive so now

508
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:50,530
we are jumping to Network forensics as

509
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,780
I've said Network forensics is an area

510
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:55,030
of digital forensics that is concerned

511
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:57,520
with evidence transmitted through a

512
00:30:55,030 --> 00:31:02,080
computer network that could be I know

513
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:06,460
Wi-Fi internet or some wide area network

514
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:09,310
and we also have to remember some mats

515
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:14,080
in networking one one this is an

516
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:17,590
Ethernet frame what we want to notice is

517
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,639
that after some synchronization thy data

518
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,760
we can

519
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,640
find destination MAC address and source

520
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:28,600
MAC address in somewhere along the way

521
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:32,520
we'll find data itself what is usually

522
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,520
the content of this field here

523
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:40,510
yeah

524
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:50,189
okay but usually it is okay it is

525
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:55,110
usually IP protocol so usually we are

526
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:57,419
going to find IP packets there and also

527
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:59,879
I won't come into details but what's

528
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:04,049
important to notice that we can also

529
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:07,590
find some source and destination IP

530
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:10,289
address now in information part it is

531
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:14,029
here we are going to find some higher

532
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:20,009
level protocol for example it can be

533
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:23,700
HTTP and what can we do to investigate

534
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:28,619
this data we can use a network sniffer

535
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:31,919
that can be a regular laptop computer or

536
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:35,959
we can use some external Wi-Fi cards

537
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:39,149
with high gain antennas and we can use

538
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:42,989
any software that can be spurred Display

539
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:47,158
Network packages to find a specific part

540
00:32:42,989 --> 00:32:49,769
of data in that traffic of course if

541
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:53,369
data is not encrypted but we are going

542
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:57,690
to come to that later on and as far as

543
00:32:53,369 --> 00:33:00,418
mobile forensics is concerned we said

544
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:04,739
that mobile phones are special kinds of

545
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:09,269
computers but they're specific in the

546
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:12,779
past mobile phones were characterized by

547
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:14,759
a large number of device types of odd

548
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:18,779
number of hardware architectures

549
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:20,909
operating systems and apps and it was

550
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:24,389
difficult to conduct forensic

551
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:26,999
investigation because singapore's do not

552
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:33,299
know everything there is to know about

553
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:35,210
that but recently there are like ninety

554
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:38,970
or something percent of the people using

555
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:41,759
either Android or iOS phones and even

556
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:45,590
hardware architectures are let's say

557
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:49,109
controls to get what is also

558
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:50,889
characteristic with mobile devices that

559
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:54,010
it is not easy

560
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:56,470
to come to the data as it is easy to

561
00:33:54,010 --> 00:34:00,240
come to the data stored on classical

562
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:05,950
computers if you have a screwdriver you

563
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:08,199
can take SD chip from the laptop but

564
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:11,710
internal storage on mobile phones is

565
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:17,799
usually soldered so we can problem with

566
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:21,010
it and also my modern mobile operating

567
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:24,669
system and patrons use full description

568
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:27,580
by default so if someone is he has

569
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:31,029
protected his phone with the pass values

570
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:33,730
and date on the phone is encrypted we

571
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:39,000
have a problem it is difficult to get to

572
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:42,159
the data and however on the other side

573
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,590
people use mobile phones more often and

574
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:48,399
more intimately that their laptop or

575
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:50,520
desktop computers so in principle there

576
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,850
are more interesting in forensic

577
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:58,720
investigations what is also specific to

578
00:34:54,850 --> 00:35:02,020
mobile phones especially the other types

579
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:06,270
of mobile phones is that each mobile

580
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:10,930
phone uses a SIM card and SIM card also

581
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:13,440
stores data you can store some data that

582
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:16,799
can be of interest in forensic

583
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:21,930
investigations the identifier of the

584
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:27,480
card or subscriber but also it can store

585
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:27,480
phonebook SMS is called records etc

586
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:36,130
mobile phones are mobile so they offer

587
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:39,850
usually of location-based services to

588
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:42,570
their users and that is the information

589
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:46,150
that can be used in forensic

590
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:50,290
investigation I'm not sure that all of

591
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:52,870
you are aware but if you make photo or

592
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:55,180
video using your mobile phone it can

593
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:57,880
store the exact location where that

594
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,770
photo was taken if you didn't turn on

595
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,510
turn off

596
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:04,940
option in settings also some

597
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:07,190
applications that are using

598
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:10,619
location-based services for example

599
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:12,990
Google Maps can catch that information

600
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:16,710
and you can get the information during

601
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:20,700
the investigation that information is

602
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:27,200
usually provided by own device providers

603
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:33,080
either GPS or mobile or Wi-Fi networks

604
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:37,109
but also if we have connections with

605
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:40,110
mobile operators or via the police we

606
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:42,600
can get mobile operator logs and extract

607
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:47,670
location operation information from

608
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:48,270
there so each mobile operator keeps

609
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:53,700
called

610
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:57,150
related data of each subscriber so that

611
00:36:53,700 --> 00:37:00,540
data is kept for various period of time

612
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:02,940
depending on the country but here in

613
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:07,380
Serbia each operator has to keep that

614
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:12,780
data for at least one year and the data

615
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:16,140
kept is data such as time of the call

616
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:18,150
duration source telephone number

617
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:21,150
destination telephone number so we can

618
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:24,390
see who called home but there is also

619
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:28,680
some technical data which can be used to

620
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:30,629
get device location so even if you if

621
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:35,970
your telephone is not using

622
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:38,160
location-based services by the it is

623
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:42,330
enough the to telephone is turned on and

624
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,940
you are going to give location trace to

625
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:47,970
your provider and this is something that

626
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:50,730
we can use in the analyst investigation

627
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:52,470
so this is one example of mobile

628
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:56,190
forensic system

629
00:37:52,470 --> 00:38:01,439
this is MSA B field and it is basically

630
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:05,790
a laptop computer with software but it

631
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,640
also has some set of cables so we can

632
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:12,750
access all different types of mode

633
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:15,720
mobile phones it has SIM card readers

634
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:17,310
and for example for the bags which can

635
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,529
be important because if we are

636
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:23,130
investigating some phone that is turned

637
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:27,600
on we want to stop it to connect to the

638
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:31,410
mobile or Wi-Fi network I've previously

639
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:33,420
mentioned that it is not as easy to come

640
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:35,640
to the data stored on the internal

641
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,590
storage however there are some

642
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:42,319
techniques that which can be used to

643
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:48,350
extract data from internal memory most

644
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:54,300
widely used techniques are JTAG ISP and

645
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:56,279
triple JTAG or join test action group is

646
00:38:54,300 --> 00:39:01,080
an interesting standard for testing

647
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:05,160
hardware and we can use this protocol to

648
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:09,270
instruct processor to get data from

649
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:14,310
flash chips what is important to know is

650
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:17,220
that this process is not destructive to

651
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:19,920
the phone of course we can always try

652
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:22,919
the phone if we do something wrong

653
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:27,270
but in principle the phone won't be

654
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:30,750
destroyed if the motherboard doesn't

655
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:33,450
support this protocol and this an

656
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:39,210
example of jtech station which can be

657
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:41,730
bought for under 100 euros if the model

658
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:44,760
broad does not support this protocol we

659
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:48,540
can try to use ISP or in system

660
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:52,410
programming to directly image internal

661
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:56,190
memory chips such as flash chips however

662
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:58,799
we usually have to fry several indebting

663
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:01,740
identical phones before getting the

664
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,740
things right and if this technique

665
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,569
doesn't work we can use the chip off

666
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:10,259
technique which means that we are

667
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:13,710
basically sitting a phone to remove the

668
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:17,520
chip from the from the board and then

669
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:19,110
insert the chip in memory dinner but in

670
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,259
that case really sorry

671
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:23,940
the phone if we cannot use it anymore so

672
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:27,630
those are something Lisbet which are not

673
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:30,180
is easy to use but also there's some

674
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:35,280
commercial service provider which can do

675
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:38,399
it for you now I'm coming to digital

676
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,760
anti forensics and in the same sense

677
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:46,280
that digital forensics is specialization

678
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:51,650
of forensics digital anti forensics is

679
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:55,500
specialization of anti forensics I'm

680
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:59,700
there different methods you can use to

681
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:03,480
stop investigation but we're going to

682
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:05,279
focus on technical attempts off I mean

683
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,590
you can stop investigation by killing

684
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,320
the examiner or by penetrating the

685
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:13,950
forensic Department but that is out of

686
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:17,160
the scope of this talk I won't be

687
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:20,730
specific about digital anti forensic

688
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:25,529
tools but when I cover most wide use

689
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:28,830
methods use you'll be able to see with

690
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:34,230
those can be used so I'm not sure that

691
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:36,980
you can read this image just tell me if

692
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,980
I'm correct

693
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:46,950
so that is why I also prepared seller

694
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:49,500
slides that show the same information as

695
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:53,520
in the image this is one classification

696
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:55,799
of digital anti forensic methods that

697
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,740
were published in one research paper so

698
00:41:55,799 --> 00:42:03,839
digital anti forensics can be divided

699
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:07,828
divided into data hiding artifact wiping

700
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:10,529
trail obfuscation attacks on forensic

701
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:13,680
methods and tools and indications of

702
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:18,049
digital art affaire asks do you have any

703
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,049
idea what will be data like

704
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:26,879
steganography can be data finding of

705
00:42:23,229 --> 00:42:26,879
course what is steganography

706
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,700
my

707
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:41,240
well that's right but we don't hear

708
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,130
necessary to go to hide information in

709
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,250
the image you can also hide information

710
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:50,080
in any other kind of data for example

711
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:54,740
text audio or video or we can also use

712
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:57,440
encryption that is one method of

713
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,450
information hiding of course

714
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,780
the adversary is going to know that

715
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:06,439
there is some data but he won't be able

716
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:10,040
to read the data and when I say

717
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:14,570
encryption I mean like increasing the

718
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:18,290
static data files partitions whole disks

719
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:20,830
or encrypting data in transit at

720
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:26,960
different OSI levels for example

721
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:27,170
Ethernet IP HTTP etc we said that we can

722
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,650
use

723
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:34,610
steganography we can use in something

724
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:40,870
called data contraception what what

725
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:40,870
could that mean any idea

726
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,810
well don't produce any data in the first

727
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,810
place

728
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:58,470
don't keep rockfalls dog cache files use

729
00:43:56,619 --> 00:44:03,160
private browser browsing mode in

730
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:07,598
browsers etc became a manipulated file

731
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:10,899
system or hard disk I already explained

732
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:14,470
several techniques what we can also do I

733
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:16,720
mentioned that there is always most

734
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:19,720
returns some empty space on hard disk

735
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,330
and also there is a slack space at end

736
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:25,089
of some blocks we can use that space to

737
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:28,359
store some data that won't be visible to

738
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:31,180
the operating system we can also for

739
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:33,549
example do some hidden partitions they

740
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,710
can be easily recovered using forensic

741
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:38,320
tools but if you try to boot your

742
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:40,680
operating system they won't be visible

743
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:44,710
we can hide the data and volatile memory

744
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:48,790
and we can also hide data somewhere on

745
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:51,820
the network the second group of anti

746
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:55,119
forensic techniques is called artifact

747
00:44:51,820 --> 00:45:01,660
piping so we are basically erasing the

748
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:03,970
data how can we unit the data so

749
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:09,848
probably the most safe thing to do would

750
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:13,390
be to physically disorder disk but we

751
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:16,690
can also use special tools that vibe

752
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:20,770
your Delta so if you remember that

753
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:24,339
picture I saw previously when we want to

754
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:27,130
raise some file we won't just erase the

755
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:32,230
directory entry we are going to rewrite

756
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:35,589
all the blocks probably several times

757
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:38,820
using zeros ones randomly generated

758
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:38,820
beats etc

759
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:52,390
so I don't have much time so I'm going

760
00:45:46,509 --> 00:45:57,609
to skip something of course we can wipe

761
00:45:52,390 --> 00:46:00,578
files partitions disks or metadata and

762
00:45:57,609 --> 00:46:04,299
you can also use trail obfuscation which

763
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:09,759
is usually used to dwarf Network

764
00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:13,209
forensics for example we can spoof make

765
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:16,089
address we might be able to spoof IP

766
00:46:13,209 --> 00:46:18,578
address but that is not as easily done

767
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:26,429
because most eyes piece what allowed it

768
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:30,189
we can use some proxy servers tor net

769
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:34,390
some other methods and what is also

770
00:46:30,189 --> 00:46:35,919
useful to know is that we can try to we

771
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:39,759
can attack the forensic methods

772
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:43,209
themselves so we can use software that

773
00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:48,579
is going to detect forensic tools run on

774
00:46:43,209 --> 00:46:50,739
the device or we can also try to attack

775
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:53,289
the integrity of the evidence I

776
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:56,949
previously mentioned we image some data

777
00:46:53,289 --> 00:47:00,939
on the hard disk vo we always make a

778
00:46:56,949 --> 00:47:04,029
checksum to be sure that evidence is

779
00:47:00,939 --> 00:47:06,549
integral if we get to the evidence we

780
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:10,389
can just switch the bytes and it won't

781
00:47:06,549 --> 00:47:13,959
be valid anymore so I'm going to skip

782
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:18,189
that and come to another example

783
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:21,158
I want to try to discuss one fictional

784
00:47:18,189 --> 00:47:23,529
forensic investigation and to try to

785
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:26,380
identify some forensic in NT forensic

786
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:27,939
methods it could be yours so for example

787
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,249
we could have some case of child

788
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:32,919
pornography

789
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:35,428
someone detected that child pornography

790
00:47:32,919 --> 00:47:40,538
is being shared on a peer-to-peer

791
00:47:35,429 --> 00:47:44,049
network and police successfully

792
00:47:40,539 --> 00:47:46,659
identified the IP address with the help

793
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:49,359
of Internet service provider we were

794
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:53,649
able to get information about the

795
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:55,680
subscriber and device and it turns out

796
00:47:53,649 --> 00:48:00,450
that device in question is

797
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:03,118
a Wi-Fi router and that on the suspects

798
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:06,569
address there is a five-member family

799
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:10,859
leader so police goes there they sniff

800
00:48:06,569 --> 00:48:13,980
open Wi-Fi traffic and later on they

801
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:17,420
enter the premises and find several

802
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:21,030
devices such as laptops smartphones and

803
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:24,119
different kind of memory so when we come

804
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:30,109
to Network forensics what which method

805
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:34,250
can be do to do Network forensics I

806
00:48:30,109 --> 00:48:34,250
already mentioned something

807
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:46,869
what information can get okay we can

808
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:50,680
Steve the traffic if it is open we can

809
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:54,809
find this community data in the traffic

810
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,808
and we can find what

811
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:04,680
that is very important important and we

812
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:08,430
can find MAC address of the specific

813
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:12,120
device that is sharing the

814
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:16,080
discriminating files for example and

815
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:18,710
that is all T we can do s for computer

816
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:21,710
how can we fight against those

817
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:21,710
techniques

818
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:35,410
that's correct even better if neighbor

819
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:40,960
has encrypted Wi-Fi and we know the best

820
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:45,129
code are than any advanced methods we

821
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:47,110
can spoof make address we can use VPN we

822
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:50,830
can use proxy servers you can use Tor

823
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:53,620
network whatever when it comes to

824
00:49:50,830 --> 00:50:00,509
computer forensics so what can

825
00:49:53,620 --> 00:50:04,660
investigators do for example if all the

826
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:10,750
computers were turned off there isn't

827
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:18,180
any daytime volatile memory we can make

828
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:21,190
images of LCDs and SSDs and try to find

829
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:26,980
compromising data and if you want to

830
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:31,570
fight that how can we stop it we can

831
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:36,820
encrypt data we can safely erase data we

832
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:38,680
can hide it using steganography but that

833
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:41,290
is not real because you can usually

834
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:46,509
cannot hide a lot of data using

835
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:49,120
steganography etc I mentioned that

836
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:52,150
someone found out that files for use

837
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:55,270
shared using peer-to-peer network so we

838
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:57,220
can try to find some erotic art effects

839
00:50:55,270 --> 00:51:00,040
such as log files and cache files of the

840
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,629
bill to be read and we can use that to

841
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:05,259
prove that they were shared from

842
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:07,710
specific device when it comes to mobile

843
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,710
forensics

844
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,640
we can also use the techniques

845
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:19,420
previously mentioned dock to acquire

846
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:23,359
data for mobile phones and you can also

847
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:25,370
use mobile operators to get some

848
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:30,820
additional information to fight that

849
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:30,819
kind of investigations what can we do

850
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:42,709
well if you're using some new Android

851
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,960
devices or iOS devices it turns out you

852
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:46,940
don't have to do basically nothing you

853
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,569
just have to set a strong passcode or

854
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:54,380
yield on your device because it already

855
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:56,720
encrypts all the data and if

856
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:59,060
investigators cannot enter the phone or

857
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:03,129
if it is turned or turned off it is very

858
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:05,720
hard to get that data so to conclude

859
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:08,270
anti forensic methods in clues are

860
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:11,029
becoming a formidable obstacle to the

861
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:14,060
digital forensic community especially

862
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:16,069
when it comes to mobile forensics there

863
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:19,099
is a cat-and-mouse game between digital

864
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:21,680
forensic methods and tools and digital

865
00:52:19,099 --> 00:52:23,329
anti forensics methods and polls in the

866
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,868
same way there is a cat-and-mouse game

867
00:52:23,329 --> 00:52:29,329
before between attackers and defenders

868
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:30,980
information security both digital

869
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:34,339
forensics and anti forensics and

870
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:37,119
interesting research areas digital

871
00:52:34,339 --> 00:52:39,140
forensics is becoming sought-after

872
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:43,220
professionally the proliferation of

873
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:46,910
digital devices and digital anti

874
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:50,660
forensics can use to protect privacy but

875
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:53,540
it can be also used to or misused for

876
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:55,460
some criminal purposes

877
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:58,819
I suppose that the organizers are going

878
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:04,550
to share those slides with the ordinance

879
00:52:58,819 --> 00:53:07,339
so I just left some brief some books you

880
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:10,940
can read it as introductory material to

881
00:53:07,339 --> 00:53:14,599
the digital forensics some certificates

882
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:18,140
and courses that you can take if you

883
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:22,369
want to start practicing this profession

884
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:25,400
and also the links to some organizations

885
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:29,030
you can visit their websites and find a

886
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:31,280
lot of interesting information and at

887
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:35,750
the end I want to use this while this

888
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:37,490
last side slide is a commercial I say

889
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:41,720
that I come from Faculty of technical

890
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:45,459
Sciences in Nora sod next year we're

891
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:49,310
starting master's in information

892
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:52,400
security so if there's some

893
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:56,150
for your students here they're welcome

894
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:59,330
to check the sites in apply this program

895
00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:02,470
is going to cover courses from

896
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:04,970
cryptography through computer security

897
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:08,060
network security secure software

898
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:11,930
development critical infrastructure

899
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:14,509
security to digital forensics and more

900
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:18,549
information will be available you know

901
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:24,400
in roughly half year add those addresses

902
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:24,400
so thank you very much on your attention

903
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:51,150
you
