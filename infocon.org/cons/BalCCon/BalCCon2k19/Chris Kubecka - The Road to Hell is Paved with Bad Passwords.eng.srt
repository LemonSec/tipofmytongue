1
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:36,030
oh good afternoon everyone thank you

2
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,190
very much for joining me for this talk

3
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,650
this will actually be the first time

4
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:45,030
that it is recorded for certain reasons

5
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:47,519
and I will discuss during the talk to

6
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,160
give you a little bit of an idea of who

7
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,170
I am and some of my background I do a

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,550
lot of cyberwarfare advisement for

9
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,400
various governments and Parliament's

10
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,040
around the world as a matter of fact on

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,309
Monday I will have a 12 hour layover in

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,250
Paris not really I don't like Paris for

13
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,880
a cyber crisis workshop with NATO and

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,049
celebrating the 70th anniversary of NATO

15
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,020
this year

16
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:16,260
my background is in a lot of IT IOT and

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,460
especially in ICS SCADA systems and I've

18
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,500
been doing it for quite some time

19
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,169
starting with the United States Air

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,479
Force Space Command where we had to deal

21
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,520
a lot with all sorts of industrial

22
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,070
control systems and control systems with

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,579
satellites and also because it was part

24
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,219
of the US military we had a very high

25
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:37,350
threat risk profile from all sorts of

26
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,658
people and satellite systems are not

27
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,490
usually the most secure things even to

28
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,049
this day the majority of them do not

29
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,030
have any encryption

30
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,929
luckily the Air Force brought me in

31
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:51,210
because fortunately or unfortunately

32
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:54,030
when I was a 10 year old I kind of got

33
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,710
into a bit of trouble because I was

34
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,259
caught breaking into the Department of

35
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,839
Justice and for eight years I was not

36
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,869
permitted to use any sort of electronics

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:08,580
until the US Air Force took me in at the

38
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:11,280
age of 18 so this talk it's very

39
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,380
interesting it's not your say typical

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,860
hacker talk because it's dealing with in

41
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:20,130
Incident Response dealing with an actual

42
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:24,990
case of cyber terrorism now what had

43
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:27,359
happened was in the year 2014 this royal

44
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,739
Saudi Arabian embassy in The Hague in

45
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,269
the Netherlands was

46
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:36,849
and it was quite an interesting day when

47
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:41,469
they contacted me because I was in the

48
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:43,328
middle of eating lunch and I III think

49
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:46,629
it was eating spinach because I was all

50
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:51,150
in my mouth and a very large gentleman

51
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:55,689
and a very nice suit came to get me and

52
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,849
usually that's not a good sign but I

53
00:02:55,689 --> 00:03:01,420
asked the individual hey what's going on

54
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:04,000
and he said hey I'm not at that

55
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,250
particular pay grade to actually know

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,060
what's going on but I have to summon you

57
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:13,329
there's been a problem and I was quickly

58
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,909
briefed by my management and in contact

59
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:19,510
with the security services and so forth

60
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:22,090
of Saudi Arabia and it turns out that

61
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,120
the email account for the official

62
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:28,209
business email for the embassy had been

63
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,819
broken into so they immediately brought

64
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,169
me to the embassy and because this

65
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:34,708
looked like it was an incident

66
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:38,379
I brought my forensics expert with me

67
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:42,729
because we had to figure out what was

68
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:45,280
going on now this particular incident

69
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:47,530
actually spread out from the embassy

70
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,689
involved over 20 different embassies in

71
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,209
The Hague it also involved the

72
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:54,269
diplomatic police of the Netherlands the

73
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:56,949
Netherlands special intervention

74
00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:00,759
anti-terrorism unit also became involved

75
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:03,879
there were several separate regular

76
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:05,649
police reports and the incident was so

77
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:07,358
bad that the Royal Embassy of Saudi

78
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,729
Arabia and several other embassies

79
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:14,769
actually had to put in a warning on

80
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:16,299
their official embassy websites now one

81
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:18,639
thing you have to understand about an

82
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:21,758
embassy is it is sovereign property of

83
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,210
that particular country local laws do

84
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,030
not apply whatsoever you could witness a

85
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:30,190
crime through the window occurring

86
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,508
inside an embassy and if you call the

87
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,570
police they will tell you there is

88
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:37,449
nothing that can be done the only people

89
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,610
that have any sort of authority in that

90
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,040
matter is actually the ambassador of

91
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,790
that particular

92
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,610
the sea and the diplomatic police have

93
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:51,030
very very very limited jurisdiction and

94
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:55,320
in most cases that refers back to the

95
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:58,020
Ambassador so the entire incident

96
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:02,340
actually involved four major incidents

97
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:05,039
and it began with the email account hack

98
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,739
and we also found the first day that we

99
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,040
came that there was a rootkit installed

100
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,470
on the business portion of the embassy

101
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,350
network now one thing to also consider

102
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,410
is a lot of embassies around the world

103
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:23,160
are also intelligence gathering stations

104
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:26,160
and we had to be very very cautious

105
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,600
which network we were actually doing a

106
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,970
whole bunch of packet captures on

107
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,860
because obviously the Saudi Arabian

108
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,420
intelligence apparatus did not want us

109
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,540
to see what was going on on the

110
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:39,750
intelligence network the extortion

111
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:44,720
emails that came about rose all the way

112
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:47,580
up to 50 million dollars and over about

113
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,620
432 different dignitaries lives were

114
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:54,659
placed at risk because of this embassy

115
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:57,030
attack now this is the part where this

116
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:00,090
was not really reported in the media the

117
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:03,330
next couple of slides the reason being

118
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:06,390
is it involves a particular nation-state

119
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:09,359
now one of our assessments were and my

120
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,370
assessment was the malware that was used

121
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,140
it was a regular piece of malware that

122
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,820
you could get basically like commercial

123
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,150
off-the-shelf now if you're a

124
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:21,659
nation-state and you use a unique tool

125
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:23,640
these tools cost millions sometimes to

126
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,950
produce and once they're used they're

127
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,760
burned forever so in this particular

128
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:33,360
case we highly suspected that the

129
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,130
Iranian government had gotten the ISIS

130
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,490
insider to use a commercial

131
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:43,110
off-the-shelf four plausible deniability

132
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:45,360
and some of the reasons why we also

133
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,340
suspected that the insider was being

134
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,880
helped even though he thought that he

135
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:54,020
was an Isis person was because at the

136
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,900
same time our particular office in the

137
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,389
was being heavily surveilled by the many

138
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,549
government now what had happened this is

139
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:03,590
actually a map of where I used to work a

140
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,770
Ramco overseas company in The Hague and

141
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:09,229
right next door was the Embassy of Yemen

142
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:12,080
now the building next door to us had

143
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:14,479
been up for sale for probably about a

144
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,050
year and a half because it was so

145
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,150
expensive and out of the blue all of a

146
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:23,090
sudden even though we were not in the

147
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:26,539
embassy section of The Hague the many

148
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:30,440
government bought with cash the entire

149
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:32,960
building next door so we had suspected

150
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,419
that the Iranian government had actually

151
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,810
funded the entire embassy and that was

152
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:40,990
for very good reason we also started

153
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:43,759
having a lot of problems with the Yemen

154
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,490
embassy and this is very problematic

155
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,190
because again anything that happens at

156
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:53,419
an embassy does local laws do not

157
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:55,430
regularly apply so I'm standing in my

158
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:58,250
boss's office and he had a whole bunch

159
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:01,190
of windows in the background and he's

160
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:04,789
sitting in his desk and I'm looking out

161
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:06,469
and I happen to see a drone and I will

162
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:08,870
tell you you will never forget the first

163
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:11,719
time that you are droned because the

164
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:14,599
drone actually was launched by the many

165
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:17,270
embassy they were trying to surveil our

166
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:22,430
building and on the top floor was the IT

167
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:26,930
section also we had problems where we

168
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:30,289
caught Yemeni Embassy employees digging

169
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:33,649
in the back of their property trying to

170
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:36,078
access our fiber cable so that they

171
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:39,169
could bend it and surveil it we also

172
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:40,939
caught several embassy employees coming

173
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,610
into our building pretending to be

174
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,910
employees in our canteen in our

175
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:51,140
cafeteria and we even had an incident

176
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:54,230
where one of the embassy employees he

177
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,449
had pulled out into the street and one

178
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,779
of my security analysts had pulled out

179
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:01,670
in the street and the embassy official

180
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:04,160
turned his car to the side stopped it

181
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,329
and started yelling at one of my sock

182
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,300
analysts saying

183
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:11,899
I know who you are stop following me and

184
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,699
the guy was just trying to go home so we

185
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:16,040
had had a lot of problems with the

186
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,660
embassy already and a lot of suspect

187
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,870
things and I had to write a rather

188
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:24,290
lengthy report to give to Saudi Aramco

189
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,480
as to why we were having so many

190
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:30,050
problems and they were a little

191
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,540
surprised because in Saudi Arabia the

192
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,630
compounds for Saudi Aramco are high

193
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,640
security facilities some even have tanks

194
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,110
rocket launchers and so forth because

195
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,380
they've actually come under physical

196
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,690
attack there have been several board

197
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,000
members of Saudi Aramco who have either

198
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:50,230
been assassinated or who have lived

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,240
through various assassination attempts

200
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,760
so it is not the typical company that

201
00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:00,440
most people work for nor is it the

202
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,180
typical National Oil Company either now

203
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,850
there were certain reasons why I was

204
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,859
chosen for this particular task because

205
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,810
quite frankly it's quite unusual for a

206
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,149
non Saudi national to lead an

207
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,869
investigation of this sort at a Saudi

208
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:13,820
embassy

209
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,290
I was already the head of the

210
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,870
information protection group which

211
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:20,360
covered all the IT IOT and ICS for the

212
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,300
entire image meeow region outside of

213
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,990
Saudi Arabia and also I was responsible

214
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,000
for Latin America so I was in charge of

215
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,040
the network operation center the

216
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,170
Security Operations Center and the Joint

217
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,699
Intelligence Group for the company I had

218
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,819
already had extensive experience with

219
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,529
forensics and also my forensics person I

220
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,450
still think that he is the best

221
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,399
forensics person I've ever seen in the

222
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,760
entire world and I it was a true

223
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,860
privilege to work with him and I had

224
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,040
already had a lot of experience dealing

225
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,930
with law enforcement back and forth for

226
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,290
various different types of incidents

227
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:02,779
whether that be child pornography human

228
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:07,760
trafficking illicit arms trafficking and

229
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:11,269
so forth I also do various presentations

230
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,260
to technical management all the way up

231
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:16,090
to ministers and heads of state so

232
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,710
oh I don't just hand them a packet

233
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,720
capture even though most of us in this

234
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,850
room will understand what's going on in

235
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,230
a packet capture they will just roll

236
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,450
their eyes and go why are you standing

237
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:28,510
here with the packet capture I can't

238
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:32,560
even say the word correctly another

239
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:34,870
reason was because I am a US citizen at

240
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,540
the time there is a particular

241
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:40,660
right-wing politician in the netherlands

242
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,329
called hurt builders and he had

243
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:46,329
previously made a video pretending to

244
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:50,530
rip up the quran which caused a lot of

245
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:53,950
worldwide issues especially in Muslim

246
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:56,199
countries and some of his activities

247
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,270
really basically pissed off the Saudis

248
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,420
to the point where the Saudi Arabia at

249
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:04,960
this present at the time of 2013 and 14

250
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:07,990
had cancelled all contracts with all

251
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,690
Dutch companies and kicked out Dutch

252
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:13,360
citizens out of the country costing the

253
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,850
Netherlands over a billion euros and

254
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,480
contract losses all because of one

255
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:23,950
particular right-wing politician so

256
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,930
after day one my forensics person who

257
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,970
was a Dutch citizen actually had to

258
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:32,020
leave the incident and I had to handle

259
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:34,570
everything from there going forward so

260
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,939
the first incident on the day that the

261
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:39,070
very large gentleman brought me from the

262
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:42,100
lunchroom with spinach still in my teeth

263
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:45,670
I arrived at the Embassy and there's a

264
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:48,730
very very nervous IT guy turns out it

265
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:52,270
was his very first week and he had no

266
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:55,690
hand over from the previous person and

267
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:59,370
here he was going we've we've got our

268
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:03,390
email hack okay all right

269
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:07,090
well what was the password and he's like

270
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:08,910
one two three four five six and I go it

271
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:12,400
excuse me

272
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,060
this is an official embassy email

273
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,050
account

274
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:20,579
no well one two three four five six I

275
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:23,459
was not expecting that at an embassy

276
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,410
and I was also not expecting the fact

277
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:27,779
that they were using at the time a

278
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:31,410
residential internet connection with an

279
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:34,950
outdated old residential modem that was

280
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,449
attached to it quite frankly I thought

281
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,370
that you would have to basically get a

282
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,990
DNA test before he could access the

283
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:46,980
computer systems but I was completely

284
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:49,170
wrong and the first series of suspicious

285
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:53,490
emails that caught the Embassy's

286
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:57,180
attention basically began with a two

287
00:13:53,490 --> 00:14:00,209
hundred dollar extortion attempt so

288
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:02,910
there was a person by the name of dr.

289
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:03,689
samaiyal al south who had asked for a

290
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,899
visa

291
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:08,910
now she was not aware that the embassies

292
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,860
around the world had stopped processing

293
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,719
visas about a year and a half previous

294
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,420
and they had gone to a third party and

295
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,600
all of a sudden she got this email back

296
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:21,329
from the business email account saying

297
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,770
hey we can expedite your visa if you

298
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:28,469
send $200 to MoneyGram does anybody

299
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:32,310
think MoneyGram is a legit place to get

300
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:34,230
in a visa friend yes I see some thumbs

301
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,630
up yeah it was kind of strange

302
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:39,480
especially since it was only the

303
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,339
ambassador's secretary who was supposed

304
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,850
to have access to the business emails

305
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:47,190
and so dr. Sumaya

306
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,020
contacted the Ambassador himself because

307
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,910
they were friends and said hey what's

308
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,260
going on with your secretary I think

309
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:56,339
she's just tried to get some money out

310
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:59,279
of me and he's like what an ambassador

311
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:02,010
secretaries usually probably the most

312
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,010
trusted person in an embassy so this was

313
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:06,209
quite unusual and all of a sudden hey

314
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:09,660
secretaries like I've never sent that

315
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:12,959
email we don't even process this kind of

316
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:16,170
stuff what was also strange about the

317
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:19,079
first series of these suspect emails was

318
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:22,649
the perpetrator tried to tie in dr. soo

319
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:25,109
Miah with the then ambassador of Saudi

320
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:27,449
Arabia to the United Kingdom and was

321
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:30,760
trying to infer somehow that they had an

322
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:33,130
illicit relationship which they had not

323
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:38,439
and ever they actually barely knew each

324
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:42,700
other so we went ahead we changed the

325
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:45,910
password we looked through all of the

326
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,500
packets we actually put on antivirus at

327
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,920
the time they were only using something

328
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:53,590
called Microsoft essentials Microsoft

329
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,930
essentials lost its certification as an

330
00:15:53,590 --> 00:16:00,550
actual antivirus product back in like

331
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:02,920
19th 2013 so we went ahead and installed

332
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:05,349
some antivirus we made a whole bunch of

333
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,969
recommendations moving forward because

334
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,680
there's only so much you can do in an

335
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,020
embassy can make recommendations and

336
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,849
speaking with the Ambassador so that he

337
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,980
could understand exactly what was needed

338
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:19,450
moving forward so this would not occur

339
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:23,500
again now we thought that it was over

340
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:26,110
and then about a week and a half two

341
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,840
weeks later I'm trying to eat lunch

342
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:31,420
again and I will add I barely ever was

343
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:36,400
able to eat lunch at my work because it

344
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:39,930
was always an incident so same guy same

345
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,970
nice suit I've come to summon you

346
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:45,729
there's been a problem and I'm like

347
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:49,980
alright either somebody died they

348
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,980
finally found out I was mining bitcoins

349
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:58,960
there's still an incident luckily it was

350
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:02,110
just the incident but yeah it was a bit

351
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,300
of a problem so I went back to the

352
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:07,660
embassy unless like hey you know what

353
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:12,609
what what's up what's going on and it

354
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:18,329
turns out that they a person signing an

355
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:21,369
email of Isis sent a 25 thousand dollar

356
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:23,500
extortion demand to the Embassy of Saudi

357
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:26,649
Arabia all the rest of what's called the

358
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,160
GCC nations and to the country of Turkey

359
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:31,720
their embassy in the hague as well and

360
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,880
what was going on was it was starting to

361
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,860
really damage the Embassy's reputation

362
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,490
because suddenly the other embassies

363
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:41,979
realized that here this email was coming

364
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,060
from the official business email of the

365
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:47,230
Embassy of Saudi

366
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:50,710
via signed by Isis that they could save

367
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,170
many lives and this was potentially

368
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:56,500
quite embarrassing

369
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:59,320
now unfortunately I'm sure that a lot of

370
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:04,750
us have done this before how many of us

371
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:09,460
have done CC instead of BCC right

372
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:13,210
well unfortunately the diplomatic police

373
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:15,730
were trying to be very proactive and so

374
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:18,730
after the twenty five thousand dollar

375
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,130
extortion attempts via email they

376
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:24,700
actually sent an email to all of the

377
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:27,040
back-channel emails in The Hague to the

378
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,050
embassies and said hey if you get any of

379
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,440
these emails go ahead and send them to

380
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:35,350
us but they used CC and unfortunately

381
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,140
they did not realize that the attackers

382
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:43,209
were still on the network and this is

383
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:45,790
actually the email sanitized of the

384
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:50,500
extortion attempts that were sent to the

385
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:52,600
GCC countries and to Turkey luckily a

386
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,030
few of the countries were very

387
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,699
cooperative and actually allowed us to

388
00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:00,399
collect evidence directly from their

389
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,990
systems and give us that evidence so

390
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,940
that we could look at it to see if there

391
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,440
was any difference if it came with from

392
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,930
different headers from the emails

393
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,660
whatever it might be

394
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:15,160
now when the diplomatic police did their

395
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:17,020
little CC instead of BCC unfortunately

396
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,670
because the perpetrator still had access

397
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:22,570
to the email system

398
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:25,930
they sent a reply all back to the

399
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:29,360
diplomatic police and to all the

400
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:33,380
embassies and say hey

401
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:36,139
how's everybody I'm glad I got your

402
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:41,240
attention we're going to start raising

403
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:44,450
up the price to everyone and this is

404
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,940
when things started to turn weird and

405
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,730
ugly

406
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:52,280
so the perpetrator then broke into the

407
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:55,160
ambassador's Secretary's personal email

408
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,360
gmail account and started sending

409
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,810
extortion demands directly to her and

410
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,030
threatening her

411
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:05,090
this was very unfortunate because it

412
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:06,680
scared the living hell out of her and so

413
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,679
she immediately went to the local police

414
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:12,260
saying hey you know I think my life's in

415
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,260
danger I'm getting extortion attempts up

416
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,940
to thirty five million dollars from Isis

417
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:22,370
and they've broken into my email account

418
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:24,740
what can I do and unfortunately on the

419
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:29,750
behest of the Ambassador we went ahead

420
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:31,670
and had those police reports closed at

421
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,780
the time we did not want things to be

422
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:35,510
too public

423
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:38,690
and so the extortion attempts went up

424
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:40,850
and it began to look to us more and more

425
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,620
like it was something of a very personal

426
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:46,070
nature that was going on

427
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:48,949
and this isn't say typical of an

428
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:52,040
outsider doing an attack but more like

429
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:54,710
an insider we also began to suspect

430
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:59,080
various people as well inside the

431
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,080
embassy and inside other embassies

432
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:07,039
finally the perpetrator threatened to

433
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,539
blow up a national landmark and the

434
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,360
country of the Netherlands there is a

435
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:13,399
place called the ker house it used to be

436
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,019
the place where very wealthy people

437
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:17,570
would stay before they went on these

438
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:20,000
cruises before they had airplanes back

439
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,759
in the day and it's located at this

440
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,820
place if I can say it correctly in Dutch

441
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:29,419
ravening which is a very famous Dutch

442
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:32,120
beach area in the hague and the

443
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:33,950
perpetrator was aware of the fact that

444
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,279
there was going to be a big celebration

445
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:39,860
there called national Saudi day where

446
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,649
over 400 dignitaries and their

447
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:45,168
high-level staff were invited - so we're

448
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:47,719
talking about the Ambassador from Japan

449
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:51,590
the Ambassador from the US and so forth

450
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:54,980
and what they said was if you don't give

451
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:57,110
us now 50 million we're gonna blow it up

452
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:00,950
and we'll make sure that everyone is

453
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:03,168
dead this is when the Dutch terrorism

454
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:05,480
police began to get involved for obvious

455
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:08,240
reasons because it involved a landmark

456
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,399
and also very solid death threats

457
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,610
against a lot of very very important

458
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:20,418
people including some Dutch royalty who

459
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:25,580
had been invited here's where the

460
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:28,149
incident took a very very strange turn I

461
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:31,399
used to frequent a pub in The Hague

462
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:32,989
called Sherlock's which oddly enough was

463
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:35,000
voted the best British pub in the

464
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:37,100
Netherlands don't know how they got that

465
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,929
one but it was very British pub style

466
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:43,759
and I liked it because it was within

467
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:45,500
walking distance about two minutes from

468
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,700
my house and this was kind of a

469
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,860
stressful investigation so I like beer

470
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:54,860
also rakia for later after I finished

471
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,928
speaking right and there were three

472
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,250
individuals there one day who were

473
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:00,289
waiting there and they'd been waiting

474
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:02,840
there I was told by the owner for

475
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:05,029
several hours sipping tea asking

476
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,350
directly about me and when I usually

477
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:09,169
came in

478
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:11,899
so I came in and here were these three

479
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:14,960
individuals and they were from the

480
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:18,110
Turkish embassy of The Hague they gave

481
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,840
me their business card as well and all

482
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:26,209
three of them were cultural attache x'

483
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:29,809
of the embassy of Turkey and what was

484
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:31,730
strange about this firstly I was not

485
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:34,820
expecting to get a visit from Turkish

486
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:36,409
intelligence secondly they spoke pretty

487
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,649
good English and said that they were

488
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:42,169
waiting for me a person that they didn't

489
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:44,389
know a complete stranger and we're

490
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:51,289
asking if I would give them English

491
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:52,729
lessons no offense to the Turkish

492
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:56,658
government but I'm sure I won't be able

493
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:59,059
to visit there anytime soon now I I like

494
00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:01,250
to refer them to them as the dumb dumber

495
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:04,418
and dumbest intelligence agents I've

496
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:09,980
ever run into in my entire life

497
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:12,950
so I was advised and reported the

498
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,779
incident to kind of keep them busy to a

499
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:18,230
certain extent in the evenings with

500
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:22,639
these English lessons that they so

501
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:25,789
desperately needed and it was also at

502
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:28,729
this time that I was advised by various

503
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:31,399
security services that they had found my

504
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:34,039
name on a list where I was a high-value

505
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:38,299
target for kidnap on a top-10 list by

506
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:41,149
Isis so at this time I was also assigned

507
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:42,918
some loose protection and close personal

508
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:44,870
protection to keep an eye on me

509
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:47,429
especially when I was meeting with these

510
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:51,029
cultural attache x'

511
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:54,989
and what was even a bit otter was the

512
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:57,149
main more senior attache gave me a very

513
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:58,799
interesting gift I did have it

514
00:24:57,149 --> 00:24:59,418
thoroughly checked it's still at my

515
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,399
house

516
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:04,109
there was nothing electronic in it and

517
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:08,518
they let me keep it after they searched

518
00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:15,570
it off he I'm not Muslim but he gave me

519
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:18,239
a set of very nice prayer beads which is

520
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:21,059
an unusual gift to give a non-muslim and

521
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:26,129
especially a woman that you do not know

522
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:28,589
or are not related to so if you ever get

523
00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:32,009
gifts from a foreign intelligence agent

524
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:34,080
always have a checked and then if it's

525
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:39,149
okay afterwards see if they'll let you

526
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:41,099
keep it so more and more we started

527
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:43,830
suspecting an insider

528
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:47,039
there was a very personal attacks

529
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:49,168
against the ambassador's secretary there

530
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,929
was inside knowledge that only people

531
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:56,549
inside the Saudi Arabian embassy would

532
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:58,259
or should know also at this time

533
00:25:56,549 --> 00:26:00,859
the Ambassador did something rather

534
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:04,589
unusual he actually allowed me to take

535
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:07,109
embassy an embassy system to my house

536
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:09,059
because previously was everybody looking

537
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:12,059
over my shoulder and was very difficult

538
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:14,519
as a non citizen to be able to do an

539
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:16,649
incident investigation in this manner so

540
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,749
after I brought a laptop home within

541
00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:21,418
about 15 minutes and half a glass of

542
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:23,820
wine I realized that the perpetrator was

543
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:27,149
still inside the email account because

544
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:29,189
on the back end the perpetrator had

545
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:33,389
actually set up an email forwarding

546
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:36,719
system and so once that was found we

547
00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:40,529
began to search further the perpetrator

548
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:44,159
then once they were kicked out the email

549
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:46,830
system began then sending emails with

550
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:51,059
the same extortion attempts 50 million

551
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:53,369
dollars to via Yandex accounts and a few

552
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:56,039
other email accounts outside the country

553
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:57,928
of the Netherlands we began collecting

554
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:00,590
evidence and trying to look at the

555
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:02,510
different hops and then using diplom

556
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:05,559
means because we did not want to have a

557
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:09,350
court order from the Dutch authorities

558
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:12,710
to do this type of action and through

559
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:14,120
diplomacy attempted to contact all of

560
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,309
the different countries are on these

561
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:21,080
hops to get them to give us additional

562
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:23,799
information now at the same time the two

563
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:27,470
key suspects that the Ambassador himself

564
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:29,629
were very suspicious of one evening

565
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:32,470
after everybody had left the embassy

566
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:35,990
except for the Ambassador myself and his

567
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:37,240
bodyguards we began and this was even

568
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:40,640
odder

569
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:43,429
almost like a very strange television

570
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,260
show him and I got on our hands and

571
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:47,059
knees and we're sifting through dusty

572
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,950
bits to try to look for post-it notes

573
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:51,440
and credentials and anything basically

574
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:54,289
we could to get into the two suspects

575
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,620
computer systems I'd never imagined that

576
00:27:54,289 --> 00:28:02,440
an ambassador would you know get on his

577
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:07,879
hands and knees and do any of that so

578
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:10,850
the perpetrator kind of messed up and I

579
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:14,029
was able to use a couple of the hops to

580
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:18,649
pinpoint to a neighborhood in The Hague

581
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:22,850
where the then primary suspect had

582
00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:25,580
actually lived and it was at that time

583
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:28,309
where we also had discussions the

584
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,908
primary suspect did have diplomatic

585
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,700
immunity

586
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:34,190
and like many embassies in the world in

587
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,590
order to work at an embassy you have to

588
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:39,049
be usually pretty educated know at least

589
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:41,330
French and a few other languages but

590
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:44,360
you're usually from a very high up

591
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:47,360
family so this was the case with this

592
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:49,629
particular individual this person could

593
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:55,000
not just be sent back to Saudi Arabia

594
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:57,649
because of this situation so instead

595
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,440
there was a decision to be made about

596
00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:04,129
what to do to the individual now I do

597
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:09,520
want to stress we never paid any sort of

598
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:13,450
extortion not a single penny

599
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:16,270
we also made sure that the location and

600
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:19,000
coordination with the terrorism police

601
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:22,600
was safe and very secure for that

602
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:27,070
particular event and unfortunately for

603
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:29,500
the primary suspect he was very quickly

604
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:31,240
reassigned to an extremely physically

605
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,630
dangerous location somewhere in the

606
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:37,510
world and within his first couple of

607
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:40,510
weeks of being there unfortunately there

608
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:42,010
was a car bomb no one else was hurt it

609
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:45,150
was only him

610
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,150
so sad

611
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:55,320
so after the incident was solved after

612
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,980
the perpetrator was neutralized

613
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,139
I got a few rewards and at the farewell

614
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:03,179
dinner of the ambassador because he had

615
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,330
been there for about five years so it's

616
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:08,399
very long stretch for an ambassador chef

617
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,110
held a private dinner with a bunch of

618
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,080
dignitaries and so forth

619
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:15,629
at a place called the Rijksmuseum which

620
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,520
holds the most famous Dutch painting in

621
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:20,940
Dutch culture called the night watchman

622
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,340
and it's so influential with the Dutch

623
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,470
and the Dutch psyche that inside the

624
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,570
Constitution the Dutch Constitution it

625
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:30,779
states that only a Dutch person can ever

626
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:32,549
own it this thing is huge I had never

627
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:34,860
seen it before I had seen the Mona Lisa

628
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:36,690
which is like that big it's like a

629
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:39,240
conveyor belt trying to see it in the

630
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:41,909
museum but it was huge

631
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,880
and so they rented out the museum and we

632
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:47,039
actually had dinner in front of this

633
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,220
Nightwatchman painting which was really

634
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,908
kick-ass to be honest with you

635
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,529
unfortunately I was a bit sick that

636
00:30:50,909 --> 00:30:57,000
night so I couldn't have any of the posh

637
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:59,880
wine but I could smell it and I was

638
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,559
given a gift by the ambassador in front

639
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,200
of the rest of the dignitaries which was

640
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:07,710
rather cool I must say I still had that

641
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:12,480
one so I I did enjoy the dinner even

642
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:14,010
though I was not feeling well so there

643
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,299
are a few things that I learned from

644
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:21,240
this particular incident and a lot of

645
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:24,389
them deal with geopolitics now many of

646
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,940
us in security we think hey here's this

647
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:28,350
bug here's this web application

648
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:30,510
vulnerability here's this problem with

649
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:32,699
the networks which we need to get things

650
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:36,539
up and running but rarely are we ever

651
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:39,200
faced with oh is this a geopolitical

652
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:42,120
situation that we've stepped into

653
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,070
usually the only types of people who

654
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,549
have to deal with that or telecom

655
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:50,279
commune providers or computer emergency

656
00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:54,809
response teams or unique type of

657
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:57,120
companies like Saudi Aramco another

658
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:59,810
thing that I learned was the fact that

659
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,719
an incident from

660
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:05,690
one two three four five six password on

661
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,230
an email system which still blows my

662
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:12,500
mind can actually lead to real human

663
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:15,770
consequences and involve multiple

664
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:17,830
governments and that's one thing to

665
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:21,170
actually consider a very small

666
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:24,199
quote/unquote hack can actually end up

667
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:27,800
in the long run killing people and it

668
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:31,970
was one of those facing reality of the

669
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:34,970
situation events and it's changed my

670
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:37,010
mindset ever since another thing like I

671
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:40,670
said if you ever give wonderful gifts

672
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:43,460
from foreign agents be very wary

673
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:45,650
I'm currently working with the Federal

674
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,660
Bureau of Investigation on a case

675
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:49,370
because the Iranian government for the

676
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,280
past three and a half years has been

677
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:55,159
trying to recruit me and they have

678
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:58,399
offered me up to one hundred thousand

679
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:01,670
euro to spend one month in the country

680
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,980
of Iran to teach them offensive critical

681
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:09,110
infrastructure security with a focus on

682
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:10,880
nuclear facilities and with the offer

683
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,459
they even said that they would take me

684
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,270
on a VVIP tour around the country

685
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:20,540
shaking hands propaganda pictures with

686
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:22,340
various generals and so forth I highly

687
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,860
doubt that I would ever come back

688
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:27,530
unfortunately in January the Dutch

689
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:29,689
government revealed that the Iranian

690
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:32,720
government had actually ordered to

691
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:34,580
contract killings inside the country of

692
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,040
the Netherlands and it was at this time

693
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:39,550
that they also asked for my home address

694
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:43,399
so that they could send me a gift

695
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:45,230
I'm no longer in contact with them / the

696
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:49,790
Federal Bureau of Investigation's

697
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:51,830
instructions and it's very unusual I

698
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:53,860
trust me I could have used that the

699
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:57,050
hundred thousand euro for one month work

700
00:33:53,860 --> 00:34:00,379
but no I would have never been able to

701
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:02,810
come back I'm a target for them because

702
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,550
they know that I work for Saudi Aramco

703
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:07,250
they are not particularly friendly with

704
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:09,770
Saudi Aramco and they know that I have a

705
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,810
lot of information that they would like

706
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:14,060
but I don't want to ever spend time in

707
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:18,080
an Iranian or u.s. jail cell

708
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:20,359
neither of them sound very nice another

709
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,549
thing that I learned was because I'm

710
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:24,529
ex-military I've done a lot of very

711
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:26,540
interesting and unusual things which

712
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,750
sometimes can be nice sometimes can be

713
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:32,418
quite dangerous and when you're inside

714
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:34,040
an organization like that or you're in

715
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:36,168
that mindset where you're dealing with

716
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,739
an incident that actually poses real

717
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:41,839
danger I did not tell my partner at the

718
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:45,259
time what was going on because I figured

719
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:48,770
it was better not to scare them so I

720
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,899
highly recommend you actually do that

721
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:53,690
because obviously if you're a high-value

722
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:56,239
target then that particular terrorist

723
00:34:53,690 --> 00:35:00,140
organization can use the closest Hopps

724
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:03,649
next to you to get to you and use

725
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:06,170
against you the last thing you want is

726
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:10,790
your parents your children your spouse

727
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:12,260
being kidnapped so that you are forced

728
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:16,700
to do something that you don't want to

729
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:18,920
do I finally told my partner about two

730
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:23,779
years later I will say that was an

731
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:25,790
interesting discussion to have I'm not

732
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:30,410
saying there was yelling but there was

733
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:35,029
some yelling so it's a good idea to make

734
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:36,730
them aware and also have them report

735
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:39,530
back if they see any sort of unusual

736
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:43,119
activities as well in case that they're

737
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:45,470
being followed in any way or form and

738
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,270
another thing that I've learned and I

739
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,819
think that this comes from my billet

740
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,770
military background is when you're faced

741
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:56,000
with a very major incident the last

742
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:57,830
thing you should do is panic because the

743
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,849
rest of the organization will be

744
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,160
panicking

745
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:03,920
especially management they're the ones

746
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,920
that seem to panic the most and you have

747
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,310
to calm that chaos especially when it

748
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,280
involves human lives or major markets or

749
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:15,500
something that can shake up the world

750
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,990
because just take a deep breath or it

751
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,960
can absolutely be the last time or it

752
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:24,899
can actually cost real human lives

753
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,660
so I've tried to time this so that I

754
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,640
could take a few questions from the

755
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:33,210
audience about this particular incident

756
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:37,080
and also keep on time for the next

757
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:39,480
speaker so I would like to thank balcan

758
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,910
for picking this talk and also having me

759
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,550
the keynote and give a special shout out

760
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:47,670
to a couple of organizations as their

761
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:51,380
twitter account who actually reviewed

762
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:54,810
the slides with me and helped me out so

763
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:57,230
I am ready to take a few questions if

764
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,230
you don't mind

765
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:13,790
I can't hear you Hey much better

766
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:16,669
I think were there ever any regrets or

767
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:19,040
questions concerning the de facto murder

768
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:21,740
without a trial and is that common in an

769
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:25,279
embassy I don't know if it was murdered

770
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:27,410
without a trial I will say that the

771
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,500
place that the person was sent to it was

772
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:34,450
already well-known high security risk

773
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:37,160
where several other Embassy employees

774
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:39,589
from different embassies had actually

775
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:44,868
been kidnapped or killed in that

776
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:46,790
particular country so it was we used to

777
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:48,710
have in the US Air Force this place

778
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:51,230
called tule Greenland that if you

779
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:54,109
screwed up really badly you would be

780
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:56,300
sent to and this was one of those you

781
00:37:54,109 --> 00:38:03,319
screwed up really badly and this is not

782
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:06,400
a safe location to send someone to so

783
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:06,400
I've got a question up in the front

784
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:15,828
so what happened with this free Turkish

785
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:19,559
intelligent guys after English lessons

786
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:21,900
so it was kind of strange because the

787
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:26,099
senior guy actually started running a

788
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:27,900
room right beside the pub and told me

789
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:30,599
part of his life story which may or may

790
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,759
not have been true and after about a two

791
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:35,549
and a half week time period of dealing

792
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:38,549
with the Turkish intelligence they

793
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:40,920
suddenly left the country and I was

794
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:42,480
informed by security services that they

795
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,369
had actually left the country of the

796
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,499
Netherlands completely all three of them

797
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:52,470
and what was a bit odd was after my

798
00:38:48,499 --> 00:38:55,680
DEFCON sky talks there was a guy who was

799
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:57,569
former military in Turkey and he said

800
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,640
that he had actually been assigned three

801
00:38:57,569 --> 00:39:02,299
Turkish agents and they were all so dumb

802
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,299
dumb and dumber

803
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:07,049
around that time zone a time frame and

804
00:39:05,549 --> 00:39:08,970
we were kind of wondering if they were

805
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:11,930
actually the same people because they

806
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:16,348
weren't very very good

807
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:19,288
unfortunately so I'm not sure the

808
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:21,869
question over here the present you got

809
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:23,880
during the fancy dinner in from Indian

810
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:27,690
the Rijksmuseum did you get that check

811
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,819
it as well yes I did yes I did I always

812
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:31,680
check it from foreign governments no

813
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:35,369
matter how nice you're pretty they're

814
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:38,359
gift-wrapped yes absolutely don't trust

815
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:38,359
anyone except me

816
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:43,069
all right I've got a question over here

817
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:51,079
okay so if I understand correctly in the

818
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:58,980
end the main purpose of this intrusion

819
00:39:51,079 --> 00:40:03,210
was PR right well we saw that it was

820
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:05,430
trying to damage the reputation and at

821
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,380
the same time we highly suspected that

822
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:12,089
the perpetrator thought that they were

823
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:16,589
actually with Isis but we're most likely

824
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:19,680
not so I think that it was one of those

825
00:40:16,589 --> 00:40:21,750
cases where the perpetrators religious

826
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,740
views were more towards Isis versus

827
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:27,119
Saudi Arabia religious reviews.reviews

828
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:29,308
there's been a lot of Isis related

829
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:33,200
terrorist attacks inside the country of

830
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:35,940
Saudi Arabia repeatedly including

831
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,680
there's one area of Saudi Arabia that's

832
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,740
been off-limits for quite some time

833
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:44,220
because of kidnapping and there's been a

834
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:46,410
lot of discussions between Wahhabism and

835
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:49,529
Saudi and the belief that that is not

836
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:54,089
strict enough with various Isis people

837
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:55,680
so I think it was in Saudi culture one

838
00:40:54,089 --> 00:40:58,288
of the worst things you can do is

839
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,848
embarrass someone or embarrass a company

840
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:04,130
and I think that that was what it was

841
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:04,130
aimed for okay thank you

842
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:11,259
when you said you use the diplomatic

843
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:13,719
connections to find the headers of

844
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:17,319
emails from various country what was the

845
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:21,729
time frame that you received help from

846
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:23,920
those we really received some help from

847
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:27,218
some countries and we started putting

848
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,769
the word out and within about a week and

849
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:32,789
a half we got some information some

850
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:36,098
governments like Russia laughed at us

851
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:40,119
because they were not too friendly with

852
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:43,479
Saudi Arabia at the time and some

853
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:45,789
countries didn't actually respond and we

854
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:47,229
found out later that some of those

855
00:41:45,789 --> 00:41:49,059
countries didn't actually have

856
00:41:47,229 --> 00:41:53,229
functioning computer emergency response

857
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:57,219
teams they might have had a website like

858
00:41:53,229 --> 00:41:59,468
the Tanzania one has a website but

859
00:41:57,219 --> 00:42:03,039
they're actually misusing the trade mark

860
00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:05,109
because they're not a registered cert so

861
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:10,349
we run into those problems and that

862
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:10,348
that's that that's unfortunate yeah

863
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,530
it's got to be more questions

864
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:25,619
there is not

865
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:28,880
did I hear rocky Alex I see one in the

866
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:28,880
back oh thank you

867
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:38,720
okie-dokie thank you for really

868
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:41,690
interesting talk quite entertaining one

869
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:46,910
so when are you delivering us English

870
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:48,170
lessons English lessons buy me a beer

871
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:54,370
afterwards I'll give you some English

872
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:58,760
lessons but on this series not a lot of

873
00:42:54,370 --> 00:43:01,640
oil-rich countries that are always

874
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,440
developed and Saudi Arabia let's say do

875
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:06,290
you have some kind of statistics or

876
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:10,130
maybe just got feeling how often this

877
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:12,170
happens actually it happens or very very

878
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:14,150
serious incidents like this happen on a

879
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:16,460
near daily basis with some Middle

880
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:19,690
Eastern countries I was speaking with a

881
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:22,310
friend associated with will say

882
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:24,770
electronic warfare with one of the

883
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:28,070
militaries and he had just come back

884
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:30,259
from Saudi dealing with there now new

885
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:32,720
computer emergency response team because

886
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:35,810
they instituted one about a year year

887
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,819
and a half ago finally and he basically

888
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:40,850
said that he was really impressed with

889
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:43,220
them because what they face on a weekly

890
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:45,290
basis most people don't face for a

891
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:48,680
lifetime in this particular field and

892
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:50,930
it's happening constantly in the Middle

893
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:52,490
East they have suffered a lot of

894
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:54,919
physical terrorist attacks that you

895
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:57,169
don't hear so much in the news and what

896
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,550
happens as well as when some of these

897
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:01,910
terrorist groups because there's quite a

898
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:04,070
few find out that someone is working for

899
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:06,710
one of these organizations then they

900
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:09,110
also target their family so it's a very

901
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:11,090
dangerous but very very serious

902
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:13,190
situation and they're dealing with

903
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:16,490
trying to surveil individuals who

904
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:19,460
definitely have explosives and arms and

905
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:23,470
plans to carry out various attacks so

906
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:23,470
it's quite serious in the Middle East

907
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:31,280
after that really bad passwords like

908
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:34,319
one-two-three four-five-six did they

909
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,549
take some actions afterwards yes

910
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,640
absolutely

911
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:40,380
they'd had a lot of problems wasn't just

912
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,339
the password it's like their entire rack

913
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:46,680
system was in a hallway that anybody

914
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:49,078
could walk into and tap into and the

915
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,930
camera was faced away and that was also

916
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:54,839
a problem so there were a bevy of

917
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:58,379
problems and I think the recommendation

918
00:44:54,839 --> 00:45:00,569
report was something like 25 pages with

919
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:03,540
what equipment to buy the budget they

920
00:45:00,569 --> 00:45:06,509
needed the people to put it in and so

921
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:08,190
forth because what had happened there

922
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:10,040
they definitely did not want it to

923
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:12,569
happen on the intelligence apparatus

924
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:15,410
portion of the network luckily that one

925
00:45:12,569 --> 00:45:17,790
was completely isolated with various

926
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:20,040
completely different connections and

927
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:22,109
what was also interesting was when

928
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,790
you're dealing with an ambassador and

929
00:45:22,109 --> 00:45:27,900
you're making a recommendation report

930
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:30,558
you can't write it in the phrase of you

931
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:35,369
know better so it had to be written very

932
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:39,809
very carefully with very nice words and

933
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:42,059
pleasant words to basically coax and get

934
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:44,510
the Ambassador and his staff to

935
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:48,390
understand without coming off as

936
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:51,750
somebody who knew better so yes they

937
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:53,490
made drastic changes and I can tell you

938
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:55,700
it's no longer one two three four five

939
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,700
six

940
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,910
yeah

941
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:06,970
we have any more questions yeah they

942
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:11,288
didn't add seven to it oh I heard that

943
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:11,288
I've got one here and one there

944
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:23,310
yeah thanks thanks well do you know

945
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:27,420
whether the embassies of Saudi Arabia

946
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:29,370
for for instance have the same let's say

947
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,410
security measurements all over the world

948
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:33,330
are they completely isolated and and

949
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:36,690
different from each other they can be

950
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:39,150
very different from each other and also

951
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,980
that's down to at the time

952
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:43,700
Saudi Arabia did not have a lot of

953
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:47,010
people and resources to deal with

954
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:49,919
regular ite or any sort of IT security

955
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:51,510
issues that's because at the time up

956
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,150
until last year they did not actually

957
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:56,970
have any sort of cyber security degree

958
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:59,220
program in the entire country of Saudi

959
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:01,560
Arabia so that's very problematic the

960
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,509
top study was in petroleum and petroleum

961
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:09,240
engineering because it's an oil-rich

962
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:13,620
site now the person whose I felt so bad

963
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:15,299
for him whose first week it was he was a

964
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:16,980
very nice gentleman but had gotten the

965
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,690
position because he was from a very high

966
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,790
up family and didn't really have a lot

967
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:23,850
of experience he certainly gained a lot

968
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:27,630
of experience after this entire thing a

969
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:29,850
crash course so to speak yes but they

970
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:32,700
can be very different and also after

971
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:36,000
this particular incident every embassy

972
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:39,660
of Saudi Arabia then went on to under a

973
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,760
review for their security on their

974
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:46,529
business side and on their intelligence

975
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:48,900
side got another question who had the

976
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:51,990
mic yeah I have my quick question here

977
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:55,050
and so was how was the local

978
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:58,470
intelligence agency for the Netherlands

979
00:47:55,050 --> 00:48:01,650
Dutch were they happy for you snooping

980
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:03,359
around the local for an embassy network

981
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:05,910
maybe they thought you might find

982
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,560
something else there so but maybe

983
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:10,440
something they left there or somehow

984
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,940
that they they were fine which probably

985
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:16,290
indicates that they had not left

986
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:18,990
anything there oh so and they probably

987
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:21,509
didn't need to because of at the time

988
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:24,270
the very weak security that was going on

989
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:26,070
all emails the business emails were in

990
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,700
clear text for example there was no

991
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,530
encryption

992
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:30,660
so they didn't really have to do much

993
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:32,369
all they had to do was connect into the

994
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:37,290
telecommunications infrastructure and

995
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:40,470
get everything that they needed don't

996
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:45,869
make it easy for spies and let's do your

997
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:51,299
spies right do I have any more questions

998
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:53,520
I've got a few more minutes it's gotta

999
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:59,550
be one maybe two

1000
00:48:53,520 --> 00:49:01,410
I feel like an auctioneer bidder I see a

1001
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:09,450
hand yes

1002
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:12,210
saved by hand so other than the weak

1003
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:14,009
password and the lack of you know proper

1004
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:18,570
antivirus and things like that is there

1005
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:20,670
anything easily that could have avoided

1006
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:23,010
things like this or just anything like

1007
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:27,510
that that you run into that people could

1008
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:29,849
easily avoid one thing would have been

1009
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:32,640
if they had recognized that they needed

1010
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:37,530
a actual digital security person to

1011
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:40,170
handle an embassy network I there's a

1012
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:43,619
difference between your day-to-day IT

1013
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:45,780
and your day-to-day digital security and

1014
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:47,220
they'd never done a risk assessment they

1015
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:51,089
didn't even realize that they needed to

1016
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:52,859
do anything like that they were not

1017
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:56,009
aware that they needed to patch things

1018
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:59,250
and nor were they aware that you had to

1019
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:01,290
lock down physical access to systems and

1020
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:02,910
to the network infrastructure because

1021
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:05,160
it's so easy to tap into different

1022
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:07,440
things so they really needed a digital

1023
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,960
security person not just a regular IT

1024
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,720
person for the day-to-day keeping things

1025
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:14,210
running that's one thing that every bit

1026
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,810
of those could have been easily avoided

1027
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:19,859
one more question

1028
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:21,869
what was the biggest IT misunderstanding

1029
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:25,069
on their side you encountered while you

1030
00:50:21,869 --> 00:50:30,089
did this incident management

1031
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:33,170
well they kind of assumed this was a

1032
00:50:30,089 --> 00:50:37,220
very very poor assumption that

1033
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:40,680
everything on the business network

1034
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:42,988
it wasn't all that important and they

1035
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:45,029
also assumed that some people from their

1036
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:48,089
intelligence network would advise them

1037
00:50:45,029 --> 00:50:49,619
but the two did not work together they

1038
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:52,170
were not the same they did not have the

1039
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:54,420
same goals and they had different

1040
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:56,279
reporting functions so the intelligence

1041
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,680
apparatus reported directly to Saudi

1042
00:50:56,279 --> 00:51:01,380
Arabia as in many cases in an embassy

1043
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:03,960
not directly to the Ambassador so they

1044
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:05,279
had a lot of assumptions and they also

1045
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:08,249
didn't think that they would ever be

1046
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:09,029
targeted I have no idea where they got

1047
00:51:08,249 --> 00:51:11,308
that idea

1048
00:51:09,029 --> 00:51:14,569
after the Saudi Aramco Shamoon attacks

1049
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:18,739
but they had this in their head so

1050
00:51:14,569 --> 00:51:18,739
unfortunately any of us can be a target

1051
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:27,310
another question for me what was the

1052
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:30,460
biggest motivation for ambassador to get

1053
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:32,259
into get into to the knees because you

1054
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,420
know normally because he said he was

1055
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:36,490
also looking with you with post-its and

1056
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,200
something because normally we know that

1057
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:40,839
from Saudi Arabia and out there don't

1058
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:44,230
easily get to Denis and try to help you

1059
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:46,869
so what was the motivation for him or

1060
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:49,390
how did you treat him to do that he

1061
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:52,960
actually started doing it himself

1062
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:56,220
and that was very strange but I think it

1063
00:51:52,960 --> 00:52:00,130
was the desperate situation that himself

1064
00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:03,520
his friends and his family were at

1065
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:05,980
direct risk because the perpetrator had

1066
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:09,220
also given information about the Kerr

1067
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:12,040
house for example and things that made

1068
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:14,799
it extra super creepy and very very

1069
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:17,619
viable in the past there have been

1070
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:21,070
functions like the National Saudi Day

1071
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:24,280
which terrorists have actually killed

1072
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:27,940
people and blown up the buildings so he

1073
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:30,850
was faced with the situation where the

1074
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:33,220
closest people to him were at direct

1075
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:35,589
risk and the fact that if something like

1076
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:37,029
that happened on Saudi national day that

1077
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:39,820
would have been a big blow to Saudi

1078
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:41,380
Arabia itself so he actually started

1079
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:44,200
getting down on his knees and at first I

1080
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:46,240
didn't know what he was doing so it was

1081
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:48,810
a very strange situation and something I

1082
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:52,450
don't think I'll ever see again

1083
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:54,310
sometimes risk of your family and your

1084
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:57,118
friends will get you to do very

1085
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:57,119
interesting things

1086
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:07,440
there any more questions got one more

1087
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:10,589
and one more there how hi Chris how did

1088
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,720
you stay not to be a paranoid when you

1089
00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:14,640
are dealing with the whole situation

1090
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:17,490
maintaining the mindset without taking

1091
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,249
the Turkish are behind me or there may

1092
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:24,629
be you know trying to steal my phone or

1093
00:53:20,249 --> 00:53:26,910
doing some crazy stuff this is something

1094
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:28,980
that I don't regularly talk about but in

1095
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:32,839
the past because of some previous work I

1096
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:35,690
had been kidnapped and held hostage and

1097
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:39,029
it was not a pleasant situation and

1098
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:44,640
after that situation and with a lot more

1099
00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:49,589
military training and so forth I was

1100
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:51,569
able to ground myself by documenting as

1101
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:53,999
much as possible because writing things

1102
00:53:51,569 --> 00:53:57,259
down keeps you grounded also reading

1103
00:53:53,999 --> 00:54:02,669
things like a playbook do as well and

1104
00:53:57,259 --> 00:54:06,960
realize that at anything that I had

1105
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:11,069
could be under surveillance so it was

1106
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:13,170
one of these things where I even thought

1107
00:54:11,069 --> 00:54:15,720
that at times and most likely my house

1108
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:19,200
was being surveilled from the inside so

1109
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:21,779
I took various precautions to do so and

1110
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,399
just tried to stay grounded as much as

1111
00:54:21,779 --> 00:54:26,190
possible because I knew that people are

1112
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:29,130
actually physically watching me so I

1113
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:31,920
wasn't too afraid of somebody kidnapping

1114
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:35,039
me at this point or it could have been

1115
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,109
the adrenaline I don't know all right

1116
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,960
thank you for the amazing talk I just

1117
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:42,538
wanted to ask you were you ever how

1118
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,029
paranoid were you when the about Isis

1119
00:54:42,539 --> 00:54:48,210
hurting someone you or your loved one

1120
00:54:45,029 --> 00:54:51,839
and was there a particular moment that

1121
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:55,980
you were afraid for your life I wasn't

1122
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:58,680
too paranoid that they would affect at

1123
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:01,200
the time my one bit of family which was

1124
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:04,078
good but there were several occasions

1125
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:06,419
where I knew that my life was definitely

1126
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:11,190
at risk

1127
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:13,290
so I updated things like my will my like

1128
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:15,390
power of attorney in case I was injured

1129
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:18,119
and if somebody had to make medical

1130
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:19,890
decisions for me and it was one of those

1131
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:21,660
cases where it wasn't like getting this

1132
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:24,060
devastating news you have cancer but

1133
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,920
it's one of these holy crap tomorrow I

1134
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:28,290
might get hit by a bus and it might be

1135
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,109
driven by an intelligence agent whoops

1136
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:32,759
so it gave me an opportunity for the

1137
00:55:31,109 --> 00:55:35,310
first time in many years to actually

1138
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,869
update all this stuff so yes there were

1139
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:43,920
a few times where I definitely thought

1140
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:44,160
that my life was at risk anymore all

1141
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,060
right

1142
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:50,160
so my time is up I will start packing up

1143
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:53,930
thank you so much back on and everyone

1144
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,930
for attending I thoroughly enjoyed it

1145
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:24,070
you
