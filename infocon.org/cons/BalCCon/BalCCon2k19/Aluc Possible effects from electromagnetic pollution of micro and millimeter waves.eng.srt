1
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,450
well I guess some people are gonna come

2
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,809
later maybe maybe not

3
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:36,530
that's bad luck for them let's start we

4
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:40,830
talking about possible effects of

5
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:44,520
electromagnetic pollution should turn

6
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:47,190
this finger on and this is actually a

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,190
walk through scientific studies of the

8
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,510
last 50 years so what you have to

9
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,589
understand I'm an old fart

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,379
so really old like old old and as I grew

11
00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:01,530
up there is a study that in back in

12
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:04,408
those days we had a few trillion times

13
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,720
less electromagnetic pollution than we

14
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,970
have nowadays I would love to show you

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,979
this study but the guy never responded

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:15,210
who did the study so I never got his

17
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:17,070
paper and I can't draw this paper so as

18
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,770
I was a kid I grew up in East Germany

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,380
and an East Germany if you wanted to

20
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,080
meet somebody you said we meet like 3:00

21
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,699
p.m. and guess what you did you be there

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,408
at 3:00 p.m. because there was no

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,469
cellphone you could not say I'm late

24
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,380
and if you're late he didn't like it so

25
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:36,929
you pediatric p.m. what if you wanted to

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,640
meet somebody and he's not there

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,350
well they had a little look like poor

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,380
toilet paper a little roll what you

29
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,908
could write down I was here and then he

30
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,759
knew that he was there that wasn't like

31
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,789
an answering machine in the old days so

32
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,630
this talk is probably present by the

33
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:56,789
department of offense sure enough and

34
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,798
since we talk about medical studies sure

35
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:01,039
enough I had to get these guys into

36
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,039
there

37
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:12,020
right first of all I want to thank the

38
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,299
cool girls and guys here from Vulcan for

39
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,810
who come from from bacha Khan to

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,760
organize these awesome conference oh

41
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,830
thank you to all the volunteers and sure

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,829
enough to meet up online

43
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:28,010
Jelena it is awesome to give us a

44
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:31,310
speaker's a platform and to give to you

45
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,220
guys awesome conference so thank you for

46
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,690
that

47
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,180
sure enough of every of my talks there's

48
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:42,590
a disclaimer so if you easily offended

49
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:47,360
please come and sit in front or leave

50
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:52,100
the room pretty short Who am I

51
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,640
all tracker they call me a dog and what

52
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,609
is a hacker

53
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,980
there was used to be a off C 2828 a no

54
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,630
changed RFC number but basically someone

55
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,859
who thinks figure things out and make

56
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:05,390
something cool happen so the question we

57
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,890
have some roots of engagement in my

58
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:12,920
talks the rules of engagement says um

59
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:15,170
Who am I to lecture you you all adult

60
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:19,250
people you all experience and whatever

61
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,809
you doing so let's work together and we

62
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,269
have a little rule of engagement which

63
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:27,170
say who works together who parties

64
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:29,930
together right so we have here this

65
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:35,268
little bit more choice with us a bottle

66
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:40,760
of rakia and if we party together we

67
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:42,350
sure enough have cups that means when we

68
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,209
work together we can drink together is

69
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:48,540
this okay with you guys awesome

70
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:51,030
[Applause]

71
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,939
so what is the motivation of this talk I

72
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,129
was like sitting and watching some

73
00:03:53,939 --> 00:04:01,650
YouTube stuff and they're people saying

74
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:05,970
oh evil say okay five g's evil whoa well

75
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:08,670
why is five G evil because it's evil all

76
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:12,480
right so what is five G what makes it so

77
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:15,929
evil a table okay

78
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,779
I just can't don't get it why is it evil

79
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:21,630
can you tell me why and people start

80
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:25,580
talking so the first thing what we do is

81
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:29,130
we check out waves so we who knows about

82
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:32,010
microwaves who of you knows about

83
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:35,250
microwaves okay which type of microwave

84
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,229
frequencies do you know when we look at

85
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,010
our frequency band we have a band and

86
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:44,539
there's a part of those microwaves and

87
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:44,539
which type of waves do you know

88
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:56,230
like eh F for instance do you know this

89
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:58,510
stuff here Jeff like sh f and UHF you

90
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:02,950
know the stuff can you tell me what eh f

91
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:05,460
is so som just enough words do we have a

92
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,460
second microphone

93
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,790
it's pants

94
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,729
you chose me because I'm almost as old

95
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:32,998
as you are

96
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:36,599
right oh oh but guess what almost don't

97
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:40,889
count it's like almost pregnant yeah

98
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:45,509
true true so when I was a kid we used to

99
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:48,779
have VHF and uhf yes being very high

100
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:54,120
frequency and ultra high frequency yes

101
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:58,169
if I recall okay

102
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,620
do you know roundabout H F which

103
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:10,650
frequency band you got now that's like

104
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:15,389
30 to 300 gigahertz oh I get some fuel

105
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:18,318
thank you since we used abuse your voice

106
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:18,319
you need a fuel right

107
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:32,380
so who wants to be viewed on talking

108
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:34,210
about sh m sh f no one you what those

109
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,719
are super high frequencies between

110
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:40,599
Twiggy guards and thirty key guards and

111
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,210
then we talking about UHF which most of

112
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:47,710
you guys all know you too young you know

113
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:52,030
you which average huh television yeah

114
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:54,130
that's what I'm in East Germany I had a

115
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,770
very my family we had a very old

116
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,000
black-and-white TV and it only could do

117
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,070
VHF

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,200
so I had to build a little converter so

119
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,719
we could we got an antenna to the

120
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,370
converter converter into the TV and then

121
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:16,150
you could on a set of several channel

122
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:17,920
you could actually receive us me so why

123
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,599
we solved this because these letters

124
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,700
might come up in the talk later a little

125
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:26,680
bit on so just get it into your brains

126
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:29,590
let's talk about microwaves where do we

127
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,990
find microwaves let's say naturally is

128
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,739
is there any way to find microwaves in a

129
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:38,340
natural environment it's like huh

130
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,340
kitchen is not natural

131
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:45,040
high in the sky can you be more precise

132
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:55,940
background noise and the yes yes you

133
00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:01,010
talking about this one's right ah just

134
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:02,810
another one more few for you well you

135
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:09,430
guys should work with us there's more

136
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:09,430
fuel do you like the taste

137
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,479
so tell me offensive control

138
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,199
and since regrets you always bring

139
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:25,029
together

140
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,029
because otherwise it didn't prepare

141
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:35,939
what else we do we'll have you seemed

142
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:47,970
more like natural way of getting some

143
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:54,120
microwaves what you serve up yeah what's

144
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:58,459
about this one we go to something

145
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:03,800
something easier what's about artificial

146
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:03,800
who knows artificial types of microwaves

147
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:18,599
the microwave oven in the kitchen you

148
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:21,889
guys this one is gone wait wait wait

149
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,889
wait one by one by one

150
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,110
so we got the microwave open in the

151
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,540
kitchen

152
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,430
that would be my first choice since this

153
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,579
is not the strongest one we got do we

154
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:42,829
got anything with many beta waves

155
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,870
millimeter waves four just to say it's a

156
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,300
microwave just a higher frequency band

157
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,200
so a millimeter wave is nothing separate

158
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,390
or microwaves

159
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,070
it is a microwave just in a higher bench

160
00:09:50,390 --> 00:10:02,240
so do we get anything millimeter wave

161
00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:04,029
hmm what right what else but I want

162
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,380
something straw all you got a big one

163
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:08,380
but I want something stronger than light

164
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:28,430
just come up here get your get your

165
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:33,339
glass radars good radars go on microwave

166
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:33,339
is gone what else do we have

167
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,470
I radiation is the question which card

168
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:50,939
type of radiation we're talking about

169
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:53,680
microwave gamma-ray is way above

170
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:54,670
microwave and the frequency bands yes

171
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,719
yes

172
00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:00,779
so what's about this one cell phones who

173
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:06,509
set cell phone before someone's did

174
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:06,509
right we get this bottle empty come on

175
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:16,749
set TV yes I'll give you empty glass

176
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,879
because otherwise you cannot fill it

177
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:20,410
it's like this knowledge if you don't

178
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,860
empty your mind you cannot learn

179
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,860
anything new

180
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,899
don't you say poster something like this

181
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,019
and your country is a way to just run

182
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:31,019
away

183
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:39,650
all right Wireless LAN circuits

184
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:43,939
transmitter towers which is a big

185
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:45,920
emitter anyway so as I looked at this I

186
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:49,010
found out okay we have microwaves and

187
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,069
our 5g works with Michael actually

188
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:56,200
millimeter waves so that's evil and then

189
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:59,480
I got the outcry of more researchers and

190
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:06,580
I had to hear this researcher who of you

191
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:06,580
guys know David Icke what does he do

192
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,910
writing books about what come on

193
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:20,510
he's a very extremely famous guy as a

194
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:23,390
followership of tons and tons of people

195
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:26,600
a boatload of people following him him

196
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:32,380
yeah he's writing books about some

197
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:36,680
theories of also of conspiracies and I

198
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:41,270
think also for aliens aliens who have

199
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:45,520
you guys's reptile alien Oh enough Souls

200
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,520
have a drink a reptile alien drink

201
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:58,520
and sure enough you're not surprised

202
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:02,029
that he has a take on five G those five

203
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:05,540
junior son evil but Murray first of all

204
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:08,029
define evil I mean a button cannot be

205
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,540
evil the man who uses two what we can be

206
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:16,960
evil the weapon by itself cannot be evil

207
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:19,250
so who knows millimeter with guns you

208
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,550
know the millimeter wave guns what does

209
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,550
it do

210
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:35,839
yes it heats up your body what happens

211
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:37,610
then it's not exactly what happens what

212
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,820
exactly happens as you feel a tickling

213
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,490
feeling which tends to hurt after a

214
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,100
while if you go closer to the source of

215
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:49,250
the frequency and what this makes us

216
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:53,330
since it hurts you you will run away so

217
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:56,060
this weapon is a ten evil no button by

218
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,620
itself is not evil so if you look at

219
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,189
this evil weapon

220
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:03,890
it works on a distance up two thousand

221
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:10,580
meters and has a frequency of 95

222
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:13,420
gigahertz so mr. Eicke says we got this

223
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,420
evil problem

224
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:26,010
sir

225
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:28,709
and he actually says I still saying it's

226
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:31,290
the same stuff what they use for 5g

227
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:34,370
which is not totally correct because 5g

228
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:38,430
runs in Europe in between five and

229
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:40,860
twenty four point seven two guards 95

230
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:43,439
kilowatts is not exactly twenty five

231
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,570
point seven in the United States it will

232
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,270
be another band in between sixty and

233
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:50,550
seventy five gigahertz which also is not

234
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:53,970
matching the ninety five gigahertz so

235
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,660
therefore his evil vapery theory is

236
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:59,940
busted

237
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:05,390
I'm sorry no evil buttons here but we

238
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,390
got more experts more experts are good

239
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:13,680
what do you think about this experts

240
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:17,850
this lady actually in Russia today a

241
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,010
little plumper lady said um and yeah we

242
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:23,160
have doctor or whatever his name was and

243
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:26,130
he said it's evil because it's evil and

244
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,650
then he was not allowed to talk she

245
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:30,589
mentioned a name of a doctor which is a

246
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,089
good start

247
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:37,080
she failed to mention which paper he

248
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:39,870
released that makes it hard for us to

249
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,630
follow her sentence and she didn't

250
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:45,360
mention which university and stuff like

251
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:47,850
this so as a software source of

252
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:53,790
Education it's a little bit I would say

253
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:57,000
at least difficult okay we got more

254
00:15:53,790 --> 00:16:03,150
experts this guy is a self claimed

255
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:06,720
expert a here's an IT guy we all IT guy

256
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:08,819
so is good as knee citee guy must be

257
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,330
good is he all right

258
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,430
and she said actually he drew papers on

259
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:16,740
his talk it's a talking Baker bear bot

260
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,569
lace and he drew paper he had a paper

261
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,130
from the University of Stockholm and he

262
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,589
had several others papers and that makes

263
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:26,070
him much better than the guys before and

264
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:29,480
then he put a claim out which he said if

265
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:33,429
somebody in the house I'm living in

266
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,429
turns on his Wi-Fi I get a headache

267
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:42,259
Jettas are possible but he failed to

268
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:44,929
provide us of a study and a blind test

269
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:46,899
or double-blind test so he just failed

270
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:52,100
to provide us with a proof of his claim

271
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:54,379
which in a university is at least

272
00:16:52,100 --> 00:17:01,899
difficult wouldn't you agree

273
00:16:54,379 --> 00:17:01,899
oh noes what can we do I got an option

274
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,629
what about this does this help

275
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:21,229
yes yet the noodle noodle thing on do

276
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:22,879
you know what the problem is those root

277
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,569
people from them I teach at a study on

278
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,799
that so a group of researcher was using

279
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:34,299
a network analyzer which cost like two

280
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:39,220
hundred fifty thousand dollars and they

281
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:43,399
fix some helmets and they actually

282
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:47,029
tested the helmets of 2.6 gigahertz and

283
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:50,168
down up to 1.2 keyguard so from 1.2 up

284
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:54,440
to two point six two guards they used to

285
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:57,080
put the 30 dates a bill actually

286
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,539
radiation against the helmets and Tim

287
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,370
measured what's gonna happen of that so

288
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:03,649
they said okay there are people out

289
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,330
there thinking and aluminium hat is

290
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:08,928
gonna help you

291
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:13,149
bad luck for you because they got

292
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:16,820
results and the results actually says

293
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:22,189
that these helmets actually do not

294
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:25,399
provide any safety against radiation but

295
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:28,100
the amplifier one point two and one

296
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:31,549
point four gigahertz by about 30

297
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:34,668
decibels now if you will actually looked

298
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:36,820
in the FCC regulations 1.2 gigahertz is

299
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:39,260
used by the US government for

300
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,040
communication devices such as satellites

301
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:44,110
and GPS

302
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,918
which is amplified my guess is that's a

303
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,520
conspiracy

304
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:50,980
somebody must spread the word that

305
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,620
aluminum tin foil hats actually help

306
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:56,020
against they wanted to be against the

307
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:58,449
government against manipulation of your

308
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:01,710
brain so somebody spread it must be CIA

309
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:04,570
or something like this maybe

310
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:10,710
so if you look at the conclusion tin

311
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:10,710
foil hat won't help us that's bad news

312
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:20,559
okay then let's do a question first who

313
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:23,460
benefits from 5g what do you think no

314
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:28,510
one aliens

315
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:31,330
well almost you could yeah if I give you

316
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:33,129
a right one on this gonna get you're fat

317
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:39,210
you're fat you're luckier I'll give you

318
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:39,210
a right on this aliens define engines

319
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:48,020
let's define aliens aliens are people

320
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,860
are beings who not belong to us stop

321
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,830
stop stop stop stop

322
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:56,389
are you all all people like this can

323
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:58,490
tear each year many millions so let's

324
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:01,220
define aliens aliens I would say

325
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:05,030
somebody who has no touch to us which I

326
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:08,180
say yes the industry is alien to us so

327
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:11,320
sure enough the industry has a benefit

328
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:15,650
because it can track you in real time

329
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,600
that's okay so if you have 5g you have a

330
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,580
lot of speed you have a lot of bandwidth

331
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,560
and they can track all your devices in

332
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,560
real time that's much faster than LTE

333
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,170
the government is a good idea I didn't

334
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:32,920
even think about it just come over here

335
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:35,640
and get you another rakia do you guys

336
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,640
still have your cup

337
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:51,159
we're good we aren't slides 1847 we're

338
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,160
doing good

339
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:09,970
grads might benefit from 5g huh

340
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:18,918
what about the industry if you worked

341
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:20,870
with 5g they say since that's the nature

342
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:23,929
of the micrometer a millimeter waves

343
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:26,000
that they cannot transmit big time like

344
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:27,710
if there's a tree it's a problem if

345
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,620
there's a walls a problem so by this

346
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:33,019
nature we have to sell more base

347
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,758
stations and if we sell more base

348
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:36,710
station somebody gonna mount those

349
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:39,350
 base stations so the industry

350
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,700
make some money outlets so they have a

351
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:50,830
benefit wouldn't you agree

352
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:50,830
who else got a benefit of who soldiers

353
00:21:55,419 --> 00:22:00,570
yeah yeah get your drink

354
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:08,000
what benefits industry hey you got the

355
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,890
work man

356
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:21,530
industry does benefit from it why

357
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:24,970
IOT a short radiance come on that's a

358
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,970
good one I achieve soft radiance

359
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:34,900
I'm gonna be the last man standing as

360
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:38,969
usually okay so the industry because

361
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,970
they can sell your you don't need

362
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:47,350
who else gonna benefit from 5g let's

363
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,669
don't solve it the industry because it

364
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:51,189
can sell your farmer products for

365
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:56,290
diseases you get which you could not get

366
00:22:51,190 --> 00:23:02,650
without 5g who else gonna benefit from

367
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:03,480
5g you because 500 s XL n bits are not

368
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,600
good enough

369
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:10,140
really I mean I have on my house of 110

370
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,780
bits which is good enough for my work

371
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:17,860
600 m bit is quite fast if I if I got

372
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:19,240
kept cut xi of my Netgear Wi-Fi as I got

373
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,240
this little Wi-Fi thing and I was just

374
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:26,130
in Japan so I put us a soft bank card

375
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:29,680
into it and that's fast I mean I

376
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:32,350
don't need it faster and I really I mean

377
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:35,560
I got a flat rate in Germany which costs

378
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:37,919
tons of money but Tuesday I already have

379
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,210
50 gigabytes on my account

380
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:46,530
so since I work a lot

381
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:51,850
bought so there were people in the 70s

382
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:54,190
they already started with studies about

383
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,480
this and these people used to be

384
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,630
Russians because the Russians were

385
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:04,240
really care caring about all kinds of

386
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:07,450
stuff and dear medical department did

387
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,970
some tests and when we talk about 1977

388
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:13,840
then we're talking about 10 years after

389
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:16,030
the start of the test as you will see so

390
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,970
there are some papers and in these

391
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:22,270
papers they actually wanted to see which

392
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:24,730
results do we have on micro waves of the

393
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:26,500
power of 1 milli watt per square

394
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,170
centimeter in the range of 5 to 8

395
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:34,060
centimeter and 15 minutes over a period

396
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:36,280
of 16 days at 60 days so a period of 15

397
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:41,010
minutes per day

398
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:46,809
who knows what is allowed

399
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:49,658
SHR for a cellphone on radiation which

400
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:51,970
we talking about milliwatts or what how

401
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:55,000
much does a cellphone earth what is

402
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:59,950
allowed to watts in Canada what's in

403
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:03,220
u.s. 1.6 what we're talking about milli

404
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:06,159
watts and that's a while ago they did

405
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,080
the study actually in a plant where they

406
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,870
produce satellite gear and stuff like

407
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:15,220
this because cell phones were not a way

408
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:18,100
about back then so they have some

409
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,960
studies and here there's this one person

410
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:23,559
from Canada who claims that a cell phone

411
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:27,100
has one watt which exceeds a lot to

412
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:30,549
radiation we see in the studies with the

413
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:36,760
individuals which have been actually

414
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:38,710
subjected to a study so millimeter waves

415
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,330
if we want to talk about millimeter

416
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:47,700
waves again do you have a hard time to

417
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:51,908
be transmitted through walls through

418
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:54,490
trees whatever to their nature of being

419
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:56,140
so small and therefore we need more base

420
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:59,529
stations and how much actually sitting

421
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:03,309
through papers I've found about 300

422
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:07,929
papers on cell phones themselves but I

423
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:10,510
only found about and 300 300 on cell

424
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:14,620
phones but I found actually on base

425
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:17,320
stations triple as much for this talk I

426
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:20,320
only use papers which are have a

427
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:23,110
positive outcome which is for us as the

428
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,668
user more likely a negative outcome but

429
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:32,158
for the researcher he could prove his

430
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:36,149
point so we are not clear hopefully so

431
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,149
let's go to the first one

432
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:50,050
the first one we tested that we check on

433
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:53,110
on the exchange of they go for the with

434
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:56,680
which which for the blood serum change

435
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:58,479
and the first one so I'm not a medic oh

436
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,640
I should put in the disclaimer I'm not a

437
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,310
magic so I have to read into - stuff -

438
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,930
and I just gave to talk one time and

439
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,970
just because I was interested into it

440
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:08,440
and I'm not a medic I'm a hacker so I

441
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,350
have to read into your stuff - so they

442
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,540
do the test on how does it affect your

443
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:16,350
blood pressure and how does it affect

444
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:21,389
the exchange of serums in your blood and

445
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:21,389
the food I could find out that actually

446
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:28,209
change to serum and free Avenue as such

447
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:30,280
decreasing by all the three amino acids

448
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:33,940
and your blood will be decreased by 22%

449
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,500
what she found out and just a paper but

450
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:39,040
the Russians were not the only one who

451
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:42,040
do papers like this in the 70s so we

452
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:45,240
have tons of paper coming out from

453
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:47,860
different agencies used by Russians

454
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:51,850
actually created by Russians trade by

455
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:57,360
Americans so we not alone with Russian

456
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:57,360
stuff but that stuff from the 70s

457
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:06,529
so there's another paper would come out

458
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:10,340
about microwaves and this study they

459
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:14,990
conducted on several people's actually

460
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:19,570
they used like 800 people where a test

461
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:24,470
group from 355 people where 275

462
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:28,370
individuals were male and 78 was people

463
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:31,820
where or individuals were female and you

464
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:34,518
had a control group of 532 individuals

465
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:38,689
so that's a real study and we're talking

466
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:45,559
about four and eleven males and 1 and 1

467
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:49,460
XM plus of females 168 individuals where

468
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:51,830
test group which was a part of a

469
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:55,630
comprehensive group which were actually

470
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:58,010
hospitalized and checked in a hospital

471
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:00,950
the range of the people or the

472
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:05,480
individuals they used was a 24 to a age

473
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:10,370
up from 24 years up to 49 years and the

474
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:13,700
tests actually went over 10 years so we

475
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:16,549
have here paper which they published in

476
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,889
Russia this paper got stolen by some

477
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:21,860
agents from the CIA because if you

478
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:24,549
remember or if you're here in the news

479
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:28,219
there were something which we called

480
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:30,889
Cold War and if the Russian did a study

481
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:33,649
the Americans had to steal it and since

482
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:35,418
Americans sometimes not the brightest

483
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:42,918
flames on the birthday cake they have to

484
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:46,130
steal well what was the outcome of

485
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:48,950
the study this study was actually they

486
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:51,049
wanted to find out if millimeter or

487
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:54,950
microwaves have an impact on your blood

488
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:58,940
pressure so the exposed people who

489
00:29:54,950 --> 00:30:02,720
worked in a in a satellite company two

490
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:06,529
different types of radiation actually

491
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,440
the radiation exposure did not exceed

492
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:11,700
three hours of day so they were in

493
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,820
between two on three hours of one day

494
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:17,100
exposed to radiation and radiation was

495
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,740
sure enough a few hundred milli watts

496
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:22,649
which is a little bit less than yourself

497
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,240
owned us 24 hour a day wouldn't you

498
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,640
agree

499
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:29,790
and if we'll find out actually here we

500
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:35,850
got the paper and they actually find out

501
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:39,629
that that had has actually a significant

502
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:41,189
impact on these people we see here the

503
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:45,930
changes of blood pressure and the two

504
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:49,680
groups on their measurements and the

505
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:54,270
outcome was that that male individuals

506
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:56,220
in the age of 40 revealed a reliable

507
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:59,730
change of the blood pressure of both

508
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:03,720
types you have and that is in this study

509
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:06,060
you can see it so they are actually more

510
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,250
than David Icke for you to look at if

511
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,860
you want to find out what is this

512
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:15,600
pollution with the EMF do we have a

513
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:17,010
problem or don't we have a problem so

514
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,540
there are more Studies on this paper

515
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:21,330
actually this paper you can download

516
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:24,600
this paper you just look for CIA Russian

517
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:27,560
study on EMF and you will download one

518
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:31,139
paper which is quite big and has about

519
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:35,340
30 studies in there they go from blood

520
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:38,640
pressure on effect on bones on effect on

521
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:42,000
on your genetics they go like all the

522
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,010
way down and there's a lot of studies

523
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,810
and the results are not really making

524
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:51,660
you happy if you want to sell phones so

525
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:55,490
more papers so you can see you can find

526
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,490
a lot tons of about this

527
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:03,830
but let's first of all when we talk

528
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:08,059
about EMFs which type of EMF do we have

529
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:09,770
with two groups do we have we're talking

530
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:11,178
about the pollution right now which two

531
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:15,290
types of pollution do we have

532
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:23,510
you know you'd inert yeah which type of

533
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:27,590
pollution do we have huh now we got non

534
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:29,450
ionizing pollution which doesn't harm

535
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,159
you too much and we got ionizing

536
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:34,420
pollution which is actually what they

537
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:41,690
use in the gun which heats you up right

538
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:45,620
- si si si guy camp guy up heating got

539
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:48,650
me on this alright so in our study we do

540
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:51,229
not look at papers which have ionizing

541
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:53,210
EMF because that's if you look

542
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:57,020
at papers we got ionizing EMF well that

543
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:59,929
kills you done check no more work but

544
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:04,280
it's your cell phone really ionizing to

545
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:06,650
fix their cell phones ionizing no rock

546
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:12,170
here today and you're right it's not

547
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:14,809
ionizing we only look at cellphones and

548
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:16,280
we do not look at cell towers I wanted

549
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:17,990
to look at cell towers but that would be

550
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,639
too much papers and it would blow up to

551
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:22,190
talk to or three to four hours because

552
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,830
on cell towers they found like quadruple

553
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,890
of the papers day you find on cell

554
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:30,889
phones you can research this yourself

555
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:33,320
all papers which we take now are

556
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:37,460
actually pair reviewed because a paper

557
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:43,970
which is not peer reviewed as not peer

558
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:46,640
reviewed it's maybe good maybe not but

559
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,690
meantime as I prepared to talk for

560
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,520
balcan

561
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:54,050
something happened in the United States

562
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:56,750
of America there's a company they call

563
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:59,510
themselves Chicago Tribune and what they

564
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:01,760
do is they sell news and what is good

565
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:03,790
for news companies can you tell me one

566
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:07,040
thing what is good for news companies

567
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:10,850
but scoop

568
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,889
scandals yeah scandalous get your cup

569
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:16,149
get your cup who's the second scandal

570
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:16,149
guy get your cups

571
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:33,639
move on let me first finish mine

572
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:42,409
how do you produce a scandal you go easy

573
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:47,780
you just find a laboratory who measures

574
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:52,699
cellphones and buy this thing we found

575
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:54,320
out that the cell phone FA hour in the

576
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:57,259
United States as I asked a specific

577
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,470
absorption rate but per kilogram of your

578
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:03,110
body weight and si are in the United

579
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:05,689
States allowed as a ours one point six

580
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:08,030
much per kilogram and they do the

581
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:10,010
measurement quite different than the

582
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:11,810
cell phone manufacturers that cell phone

583
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,520
manufactures decided that's a good idea

584
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:23,299
to measure your cell phone while we have

585
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:25,550
it here that's the way they measured a

586
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,150
measured and between 11 and 15

587
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:31,670
millimeters away from your body but

588
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:34,010
common use of humanoids is more like the

589
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:46,100
individual puts this cell phone in his

590
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:48,200
front pocket like this and close to my

591
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:51,920
brain and has another study where they

592
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:54,830
just did a famil scan of the brain in

593
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,680
the show to heat up Vegas awfulness and

594
00:35:54,830 --> 00:36:00,770
if you go to somewhere where anger and

595
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:05,029
killed 4 million on your head and while

596
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:09,950
walking would be one very good well they

597
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:11,930
found out oops is at Apple yeah they

598
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:14,089
found out I mean that's not only crapple

599
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:16,149
device they used it used several of the

600
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:18,160
crippled devices so I just used this by

601
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:20,330
chance

602
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,690
actually I just took a picture from the

603
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:30,529
first one I got and you see well one

604
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:32,990
point six almost you see one what is

605
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,400
actually hitting the one point six which

606
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:39,799
is allowed in the United States of

607
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:44,900
America no that's bad luck let's try

608
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:47,120
something maybe they better yeah they

609
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:49,310
better but only when he puts 50

610
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:53,029
millimeters away from their body which

611
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:55,490
is not common use isn't it who actually

612
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:59,470
use your phone 50 millimeters away from

613
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:59,470
his ear when he is speaking on it

614
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:06,860
blusette it good who uses your phone his

615
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,339
phone 50 millimeters away from his body

616
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:14,920
while he's carrying it in his pocket

617
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,920
I do sure because I don't have one but

618
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:20,839
yeah use the public transport like like

619
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:24,740
the guys from Facebook who do not

620
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:27,470
understand the concept of telephone yeah

621
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:30,740
I saw just recharge before but actually

622
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:32,930
this study of the Chicago Tribune which

623
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:36,080
is only a newspaper ended up in a

624
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:38,890
lawsuit ain't that funny and you fight

625
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:42,020
this lawsuit online is not that a

626
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:45,200
certain secret and that lawsuit actually

627
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,480
happened at the 21st of August so that's

628
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,319
warm

629
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,320
it's stirring cooking

630
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:58,550
all right there is some I only go for

631
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,930
three or four papers I don't want to

632
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:02,960
stress you too much with the medical

633
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:06,890
 there's a paper where they say what

634
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:10,810
is about 900 who knows it's 900 900

635
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:15,290
megahertz what is going on 900 megahertz

636
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:22,820
which one GSM don't get you're drunk

637
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:25,330
who else sets you 2g yeah make it so

638
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,330
engage

639
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:36,660
yes moeraki molar archeological

640
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:39,089
yeah yeah hey that's a German you should

641
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:42,450
at least know what the common procedure

642
00:38:39,089 --> 00:38:45,210
is for lucky oh really this luncheon I

643
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:50,339
can't cook in market you know you

644
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:53,099
translate now you have something your

645
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:56,400
body would call micro RNA and the micro

646
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:59,670
RNA is actually doing some with

647
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:05,040
your genetic stuff like sorting it out

648
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:06,930
and cleaning it and dividing it and they

649
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,390
said well we don't know what's gonna

650
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:12,629
happen with the micro on a while you'll

651
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:15,000
expose to the 900 frequency radio

652
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:19,650
frequency sorry I decided that's a good

653
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:22,349
idea to do a study on that and they

654
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:25,230
exposed some rats which is close to

655
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:28,109
human and my opinion at least a few once

656
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:31,890
we have been to an departments always

657
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:35,460
just on sale for an instant so did it

658
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:38,490
expose some rats 12 months every day for

659
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:42,210
three hours on a frequency of 900

660
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:43,439
megahertz of RF radiation and then sure

661
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:46,819
enough what you do with the rats you

662
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,190
kill them check their brain out and

663
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:51,990
investigate what's gonna happen what the

664
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:58,290
results of the long term of exposure

665
00:39:51,990 --> 00:40:00,598
after RF radiation was that um Oh micro

666
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:05,579
are an aide and the type woman at nine

667
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:07,410
which leads was actually decreased and

668
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:11,250
at least to the conclusion that 900

669
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:14,779
megahertz actually effects you are micro

670
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:17,910
RNA which is a part of just genetics and

671
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:19,319
if Odin didn't want you to need to have

672
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:25,920
this genetics you wouldn't put it into

673
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:28,349
you when you agree so the finger states

674
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,099
that we should do further into

675
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:33,540
investigation now if you as a person of

676
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:37,859
computer stuff

677
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:39,509
listen to following thing I've found an

678
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:43,740
exploit on window

679
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:46,740
on Windows 10 which might result in a

680
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:50,220
remote exploit would you put your

681
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:55,189
Windows 10 and unprotected exposed to

682
00:40:50,220 --> 00:41:01,230
the network who would no one you would

683
00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:05,550
no see why do you expose your brain to

684
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:07,230
the to the cell phones when actually the

685
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:12,859
scientists say well we need to

686
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:22,380
investigate this good question isn't it

687
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:27,630
but more fun whose mail that's a lot of

688
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:28,430
rakia right there are females good on

689
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:31,590
this one

690
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:37,710
by the way trying being transgender

691
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:40,770
don't help you on this one well they act

692
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:43,380
like chests and this is not this is just

693
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:46,140
from the Indian guys which are meant I

694
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:49,140
named up there you always see who's

695
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:51,420
doing the paper and actually not just

696
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:54,180
these guys came out in this idea also

697
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:56,550
the guys from University of Stockholm

698
00:41:54,180 --> 00:42:00,740
and a few other universities got the

699
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:07,980
idea that carrying your cell phone here

700
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:11,759
we're at the Tesla so here it's not the

701
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:16,220
brightest idea because the production of

702
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:20,670
sperm can do - just like a cancer and

703
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:23,359
well bad luck for you so they got a

704
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:26,700
result on that one which says that

705
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:32,090
electromagnetic microwaves are actually

706
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:35,720
in the allowed sra as they are does

707
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:39,800
affect your reproductive health which

708
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:43,490
means you can transfer less information

709
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,490
while having sex

710
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:49,940
there are more studies like this I only

711
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:52,070
have 10 minutes so I'll show you there's

712
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:57,230
another study this one and what they did

713
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:59,360
did it good graphics you already see

714
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:01,490
them here getting his photo you don't

715
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,930
you just go to this website

716
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,850
and you find the publication you don't

717
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,230
need to picture it just go and take a

718
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,330
picture of this pub and you can read the

719
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:09,890
whole publication because we don't have

720
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:13,040
the time for the old publication but in

721
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:17,180
the end of the day they say yeah it can

722
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:23,509
lead to testicle cancer and it can make

723
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:26,290
you impotent the German word for not be

724
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,290
reproductive

725
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:38,530
yeah let's go to our conclusion what's

726
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:41,740
our conclusion on this try to actually

727
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:44,350
use microwave emitting devices more

728
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:47,020
smart nobody is going to put away his

729
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:49,480
cellphone anyway by the way I got a

730
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:52,900
question for you guys and this question

731
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:56,350
was actually suggested to me by one of

732
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:59,410
your fellow attendees the question is do

733
00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:02,470
you know what's the fastest transferring

734
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:10,618
much faster than 5g how do you transfer

735
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:10,618
most information in a segment how much

736
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:19,029
no no no no no proof spam you get

737
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:24,850
fifteen point eight seventy five

738
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:32,280
terabytes per equation which means sex

739
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:32,279
is better than 5g you get your rakia

740
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,750
there go go go

741
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,180
it's not up to knowledge all right you

742
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:48,339
want it you get it

743
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:52,578
salute

744
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:56,089
what what what actually is a gun

745
00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:58,690
production company and Russia they

746
00:44:56,089 --> 00:45:04,160
produce my most favorite aks

747
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:07,279
okay so what else actually you just try

748
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:11,839
to reduce your exposure per day I mean

749
00:45:07,279 --> 00:45:14,299
is it really neat is really needed that

750
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:16,880
you have it on on you all day long

751
00:45:14,299 --> 00:45:18,740
what's about not buying the newest

752
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:23,240
from the companies just because they

753
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:24,828
advertise it's really funny and maybe

754
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,328
it's a good idea to turn off these

755
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:28,309
devices when you don't need them like

756
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:30,799
when you're sleep you want to have a

757
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:32,990
reception anyway because when you sleep

758
00:45:30,799 --> 00:45:38,230
you can hear noises but you cannot

759
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:41,549
compile I don't listen to me either

760
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:49,549
sorry any questions

761
00:45:41,549 --> 00:45:49,549
I know how to turn people away yes

762
00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:03,050
the number that we gave for if

763
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:06,770
information transfer by sperm is based

764
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:10,880
on what the amount of information of in

765
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:14,210
the DNA and the number of spermatozoids

766
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:18,560
actually it's a one sperm actually

767
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:20,210
transfers 38.7 megabytes and if he

768
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,279
doesn't wear cell phone all day long

769
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:25,940
that you might get enough sperm to

770
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:28,130
transfer 15 terabytes yeah in this 2

771
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:29,690
seconds in your form your DNA in just

772
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:32,690
two seconds where you will actually

773
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:34,490
attack you late but do not forget to

774
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:37,070
compile in your calculation there is

775
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:40,640
some firewall on the other side which

776
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:43,750
calls egg that's true but my point being

777
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:50,799
is that the information stored in each

778
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:50,800
spermatozoid is the same no since when

779
00:46:53,109 --> 00:47:01,009
okay but it's actually you if you want

780
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:04,819
to soft for good go to flatten he is the

781
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:07,549
one who would suggested this one okay

782
00:47:04,819 --> 00:47:12,259
flatten is a naughty oh yeah there we go

783
00:47:07,549 --> 00:47:18,140
he is the expert on sperm the week we

784
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:20,569
call them the spirometer okay but my the

785
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:25,190
point guess what 15 terabytes is a lot

786
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:27,799
information to swallow okay I'm still

787
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:30,790
claiming that it's not the the amount

788
00:47:27,799 --> 00:47:34,160
you're giving us it's smaller

789
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:40,009
well 37 actually if you don't we're

790
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:42,140
phone 38 megabytes per sperm that's what

791
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:44,030
the science says but I did not true a

792
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:46,430
paper because he told me doesn't break

793
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:48,290
first and I did not have time to find

794
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:51,710
the right papers for that I'm sorry

795
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:53,660
this is kind of unscientific scientific

796
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:56,000
then I don't have two papers for it but

797
00:47:53,660 --> 00:48:00,759
I'll find you the paper no no I mean

798
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,559
fine fine research on internet yeah this

799
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:06,980
sounds like some classy we don't have a

800
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:10,690
lot of time yes give him the microphone

801
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:12,589
oh sorry he was faster but your next one

802
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:15,890
thank you for a very interesting

803
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:18,290
presentation in your daily life what

804
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:19,640
real come to measure do you put like for

805
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:22,369
example when you buy your phone do you

806
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:25,308
look at the data sheet or test if you

807
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:28,430
live in a stop on all German guy what I

808
00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:30,770
do first is cannot route it easily so we

809
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:34,430
only have two choices Nokia which sucks

810
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:38,599
or oneplus so because when one plus I

811
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:40,009
say fastboot OEM unlock that's an

812
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:42,559
important thing because then I can make

813
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:44,450
it secure but in my daily life I stopped

814
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,369
carrying a phone and not because I'm

815
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:50,390
scared of the radiation but people

816
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:53,859
called me and that starts to get in

817
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:56,339
doing so I stopped carrying a telephone

818
00:48:53,859 --> 00:49:01,110
this guy

819
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:05,250
more rakia for you there's no escaping

820
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:10,080
the bottle I just have an answer for

821
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:13,830
your sperm discussion man you know if

822
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:16,319
you download a movie twice you download

823
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:23,340
it twice you have moved the information

824
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:28,610
even if it's not unique information what

825
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:28,610
you say that's also in between medics

826
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,390
get yourself something to drink

827
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,530
it's Japan sir

828
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:58,140
more questions yes yeah but microphone

829
00:49:54,420 --> 00:50:01,019
hey who got to my Oh question yeah yeah

830
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:03,749
so I had a question on the specific

831
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:06,238
absorption rates the that is rated on

832
00:50:03,749 --> 00:50:07,948
these phones nowadays right I'm not sure

833
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:09,599
if this is throughout the world but in

834
00:50:07,949 --> 00:50:11,969
India like each phone is supposed to

835
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,979
come with a supposed to mention the

836
00:50:11,969 --> 00:50:18,809
specific absorption rates while being

837
00:50:13,979 --> 00:50:21,538
sold right so if you ever see a specs

838
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:23,279
each sheet where they put it as our a on

839
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:28,439
the spec sheet please click the

840
00:50:23,279 --> 00:50:31,079
subscribe button so it's a good thing if

841
00:50:28,439 --> 00:50:34,680
it is lower like then usually don't put

842
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:36,479
as our SAR on it but the government says

843
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:41,180
in the United States should not be more

844
00:50:36,479 --> 00:50:44,879
than one point six what kilogram and in

845
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:46,939
Canada's - I don't even know the whole

846
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:50,130
world because there are many different

847
00:50:46,939 --> 00:50:52,649
specifications but if you ever find a

848
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:57,019
cell phone advertisement which says the

849
00:50:52,650 --> 00:51:00,439
SAR click the subscribe button

850
00:50:57,019 --> 00:51:00,439
get your drink

851
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:16,660
hey wait okay we string together never

852
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,660
drink alone bad manners

853
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,700
okay I'd go a step further and okay so

854
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:25,460
we put our cell phone away fine which is

855
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:27,620
a big deal because cell phone is the

856
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:30,050
route oh I did not say I said just

857
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:32,089
minimize your exposure I did not say put

858
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:35,390
it away that would be a stupid sentence

859
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:38,210
okay yeah my point is this okay we put

860
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:40,370
we did put our phone away so we remove

861
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:42,830
that but there are still microwaves and

862
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:45,080
wi-fi's and cell towers around the

863
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:48,170
houses et cetera et cetera et cetera any

864
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:50,450
thoughts on how we can reduce this

865
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:54,320
cumulative exposure yes

866
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:57,350
but it's kind of not so legal I actually

867
00:51:54,320 --> 00:52:02,030
wanted to put you up a how to build my

868
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:05,930
own EMA EMP device but the best legal

869
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:08,900
way to reduce your exposures move to

870
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:15,470
countryside because in my house we don't

871
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:17,570
have an LTE we don't have 3G so yes but

872
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:21,799
what you can do and you're homeless you

873
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:26,180
maybe do not use a microwave maybe you

874
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:29,680
get real food maybe you just don't turn

875
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:33,200
on the Wi-Fi night time but as I said

876
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:35,859
base stations are real problem because

877
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,359
you cannot put it away it's there and

878
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:40,040
there are more Studies on base station

879
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:43,970
than on cellphones and those studies are

880
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:46,160
really hurting and they just follow

881
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:51,290
follow up just give them the microphone

882
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:54,620
and get your drink move to the basement

883
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:56,150
there's a good one or move to country no

884
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,859
it's actually not a good idea to move to

885
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,870
basement or to move too far away from

886
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:01,520
base stations

887
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:06,049
the idea behind or the problem there is

888
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:10,730
your cell phone ramps up the energy on

889
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:13,700
it's only when it's turned on on it yes

890
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:16,130
right I don't need a cell phone if I

891
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:18,560
don't turn it on okay it's totally

892
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:19,790
stupid your Wi-Fi or your child's cell

893
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,150
phone while you're sleeping because

894
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:23,099
while you're sleeping you don't

895
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:25,440
nice reception yes that's true about

896
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:28,109
during the day during the day

897
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,460
III tell you how I do it we don't have

898
00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:31,619
reception in the little village I'm

899
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:33,930
living in because I live in Germany and

900
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:37,579
we're lucky enough to not have reception

901
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:40,230
what I do is my cell phone is actually

902
00:53:37,579 --> 00:53:41,700
laid over and you call me on my cell

903
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:44,670
phone it goes over to voice over IP

904
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:47,490
which goes to avoid zip soft phone

905
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:49,710
client on my on my computer and if I'm

906
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:52,140
in the mood to have it on then I may

907
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:54,329
even answer your call but your chances

908
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:57,598
are 99% that I don't have to supply

909
00:53:54,329 --> 00:54:00,270
running well I'm a younger generation

910
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:08,940
than you and I like to watch YouTube

911
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:11,339
that is not mine shrinking not mine okay

912
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:13,200
but I think the over draws a time line

913
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:17,819
nobody still in time she still can ask

914
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:23,669
questions I need a second bubble second

915
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:27,660
bottle no hey so what would be the best

916
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:28,980
way to weaponize a 5g base station if

917
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:33,980
you're not a mobile operator

918
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:37,789
oh oh oh if you want to weaponize a non

919
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:41,039
ionization base station you need to have

920
00:54:37,789 --> 00:54:44,630
serious modifications on that because

921
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:46,710
you cannot like having some what emits

922
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:51,660
0.5 power of 5 Watts

923
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:53,460
up to 100 megawatts like this so to

924
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:55,558
weaponize the base station you need to

925
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:57,260
actually if you look in the basis you

926
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:01,490
need to rebuild this piece of or

927
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:04,650
you will already send out base stations

928
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:06,868
which are bigger but the problems we

929
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:12,000
live in capitalism and capitalism is a

930
00:55:06,869 --> 00:55:13,440
system where people try to be cheap they

931
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,470
don't want to waste money while

932
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:19,260
producing so your base station need

933
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:24,000
to be replaced to weaponize it on the

934
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:26,460
other hand base stations have an serious

935
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,740
impact on your health and that is proven

936
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:31,619
by millions of many not millions but

937
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:32,459
thousands of medical papers and you find

938
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:35,400
them

939
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:38,820
had actually to go I went to to a thing

940
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:41,010
but was allowed to view medical papers

941
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:42,300
but I had to prove that I'm a researcher

942
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:45,150
otherwise I had to pay for this

943
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:47,609
information so I just wrote them a

944
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:49,800
letter that I prepared a talk on a

945
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:51,540
conference and it was already scheduled

946
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,640
so that was the reason why I could read

947
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:56,250
your medical paper for free but you'll

948
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:59,940
find many medical papers on base station

949
00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:02,849
so is it verbalizing when you get like

950
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:07,200
brain cancer you can actually choose by

951
00:56:02,849 --> 00:56:10,290
yourself to answer 5g is not bad because

952
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:13,740
of the frequency 5g is bad because of

953
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:15,980
the frequency if you understand I'm

954
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,979
saying

955
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:24,640
I think that's actually a good point

956
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:28,810
what you're saying but 5g is not only

957
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:33,069
because of this pet meme you just showed

958
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:37,720
it to us that the industry is yeah

959
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:41,050
create owner of the five-cheese stuff

960
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:43,959
and they are getting more profit from it

961
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:46,510
than anyone else I think and this is

962
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:51,070
also a problematic thing because I mean

963
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:51,970
beside of the yeah getting the radiation

964
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:56,110
from it

965
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:58,810
we also are I mean populated through a

966
00:56:56,110 --> 00:57:00,640
full control of everything I mean this

967
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:03,430
is also a criticism point I think we

968
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:06,460
need to show up absolutely agree also a

969
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:08,740
point of 5g where we have profiles I

970
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:11,920
totally agree with you Victor they

971
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:13,899
totally can see what we do but I do not

972
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,390
agree with you but that's a problem if

973
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:18,070
somebody makes more profit in my opinion

974
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:19,960
if you work hard and you earn money

975
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:23,170
that's ok that's not my problem

976
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:25,420
I'm not greedy or guilty for people who

977
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:27,520
earn more money than I do because that's

978
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:29,740
ok they work I have no problems with

979
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,509
this I only have problems if they

980
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:33,939
actually put the health of my children

981
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:36,130
into danger and that's why I give this

982
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:38,380
talk this talk was very dearly to me

983
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:41,080
because I wanted people to understand

984
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:45,580
that buying the newest is not

985
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:47,470
always the best decision in life because

986
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:51,520
I have children and I'm careful about

987
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:55,089
this but your point about being watched

988
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:58,620
all the time well I said this yes they

989
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:58,620
can monitor you in real time

990
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:03,070
so in my hometown we have a Institute

991
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:09,490
who offers

992
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:14,020
5g detox resilience yoga should I attend

993
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:16,620
or not no okay get yourself a tinfoil

994
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:16,620
hat that's better

995
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:23,050
actually to be honest with you if you

996
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:25,960
ever find somebody who says that you can

997
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:29,619
through movements of your body you're

998
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:34,810
silly eight or actually defy irradiation

999
00:58:29,619 --> 00:58:39,070
which goes through walls and your skin

1000
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:43,600
and bones then you know this guy is a

1001
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:46,359
charlatan and there is no way to secure

1002
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:48,880
yourself from 5g or actually from

1003
00:58:46,359 --> 00:58:50,830
microwaves let's don't put it on 5g just

1004
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,980
put the micro millimeter waves as we

1005
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:58,029
just learned there are satellites

1006
00:58:53,980 --> 00:59:00,340
emitting 81-point gigahertz 81 gigahertz

1007
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:03,490
millimeter waves because they want to

1008
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:05,530
find out if their seismic movements in

1009
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:07,000
the earth and you cannot escape this

1010
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:09,340
when you in this era you in this era

1011
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,850
that's the way it is and detoxing your

1012
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:18,490
body from radiation by moving this way

1013
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:20,618
is maybe not gonna work and that yeah

1014
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:22,450
you could put yourself in that but they

1015
00:59:20,619 --> 00:59:28,119
found out let us not good and healthy

1016
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:30,299
for you well you get your drink more

1017
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:33,580
questions last question last question

1018
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:36,100
I'm very clumsy so I got this massive

1019
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:38,470
phone case if I get three massive phone

1020
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:41,049
cases and put it all on the phone am i

1021
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:43,118
safe the problem is if you say if you

1022
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:44,859
don't have a reception and you don't

1023
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,570
leave a Malthus massive phone case you

1024
00:59:44,859 --> 00:59:48,460
just need one what keeps your phone from

1025
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:51,010
receipt from a farmer receiving and from

1026
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:52,150
sending but you're still not safe

1027
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:57,460
because they are something what she

1028
00:59:52,150 --> 01:00:01,180
calls a base station and is like on 5g

1029
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:02,859
every 10 houses and that doesn't make

1030
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,419
you say if it doesn't matter if you have

1031
01:00:02,859 --> 01:00:06,430
a phone of you're not what makes you

1032
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:09,930
safe is going to country search and

1033
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:09,930
those two guys have to get a drink

1034
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:19,109
actually it's not a question it's a plus

1035
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:22,589
something that I see before 20 years ago

1036
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:30,150
when I first cellphone just golden my

1037
01:00:22,589 --> 01:00:35,869
country and it was Nakia 30 33 something

1038
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:41,520
like this or sony ericsson 888 they cell

1039
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:42,270
size of the five millimeters about ten

1040
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:46,650
millimeters

1041
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:50,009
they sell organic coal press it and you

1042
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:55,580
put it on a telephone and then no

1043
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:58,020
radiation I usually put telephone into a

1044
01:00:55,580 --> 01:01:02,009
pork leg and it doesn't have radiation

1045
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:05,160
yeah he said you know what position

1046
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:09,300
radiation yeah like this that's right

1047
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:12,330
no all right we done I mean we over drew

1048
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:15,390
and people want to yeah I know you want

1049
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:19,589
a drink but five minutes oh we got we

1050
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:25,740
just squeezed us five more minutes she's

1051
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:27,509
lady she's a lady so we have to at least

1052
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:29,419
you can't produce sperm so you don't

1053
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:33,270
have problems

1054
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:35,099
yes but women have another problem when

1055
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:39,450
you are pregnant they will scan your

1056
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:44,760
belly and then we'll use the system that

1057
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:48,598
also use microwaves yes the doctors need

1058
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:52,950
to do three three of that but the limit

1059
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:56,040
is five yeah number is this also risky

1060
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:58,230
and I want to ask you did you read the

1061
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:01,290
novel thank you for smoking or maybe

1062
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:05,160
watch the movie I'm not into movies and

1063
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:07,770
I did not read the novel unfortunately a

1064
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:10,890
kind of busy guy otherwise I could not

1065
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:14,160
afford a flight to come here but what I

1066
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:17,040
can tell you I was scanned on a scanner

1067
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:20,319
on my way to Tokyo and they said it's

1068
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:23,058
safe because microwaves

1069
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:25,909
every time you know what's the worst job

1070
01:02:23,059 --> 01:02:28,789
you can get as flight attendant because

1071
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:31,029
you get exposed to x-ray all day long

1072
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:34,219
every day when you go intercontinental

1073
01:02:31,029 --> 01:02:37,519
but yes you're right it's not the best

1074
01:02:34,219 --> 01:02:41,169
brightest idea in the world but the only

1075
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:44,448
way you change is change your doctor

1076
01:02:41,169 --> 01:02:46,879
it's okay I actually can't do nothing

1077
01:02:44,449 --> 01:02:51,859
about it anyway and am I only a IT guy

1078
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:57,109
I'm not PhD n and medics only as I said

1079
01:02:51,859 --> 01:02:59,900
and really route IT guy so more the

1080
01:02:57,109 --> 01:03:05,808
questions or less of rakia who wants

1081
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:07,880
rakia who wants rakia then come up and

1082
01:03:05,809 --> 01:03:10,039
Great America even without a question

1083
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:13,479
I'm just generous today with the money

1084
01:03:10,039 --> 01:03:13,479
of the of Milosh

1085
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:26,170
no no question for us no I'm just

1086
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:28,730
wondering how much time experience come

1087
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:33,640
to this research

1088
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:33,640
less than $25 of watching

1089
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:46,500
have you made yourself some measurement

1090
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:48,810
about some protocols like for example is

1091
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,490
it better to a voice over Wi-Fi on your

1092
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:51,839
phone and place call with voice over

1093
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:54,868
Wi-Fi than LTE

1094
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:58,740
it's not over by fires over landline I'm

1095
01:03:54,869 --> 01:04:00,300
stupid enough to do k5 yeah in France

1096
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:04,439
long line don't exist anymore for

1097
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:07,980
example follow past six months well if I

1098
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:12,450
go voice of IP in my house there is just

1099
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:14,700
a line so we get a fiber optics internet

1100
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:16,259
into our house this is little Internet

1101
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:19,049
as a little black box as you learned and

1102
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:22,500
this black box just goes through a few

1103
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:25,500
of those firewalls and then it ends up

1104
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:28,740
in my computer which is pack cable I

1105
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:32,880
don't have Wi-Fi because we have thick

1106
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:35,339
bolts I have an old farmhouse so Wi-Fi

1107
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:37,800
won't work so we don't have Wi-Fi not

1108
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:40,320
folder oh I'm so scared we have don't

1109
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:42,030
have Wi-Fi because it just don't work so

1110
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:44,280
we have everything with cables and since

1111
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:46,560
it's my own house I can just drill a

1112
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:51,599
hole in the wall and put a cable through

1113
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:53,009
it nobody gonna complain you just want

1114
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,550
to rock yeah I know but you can have it
