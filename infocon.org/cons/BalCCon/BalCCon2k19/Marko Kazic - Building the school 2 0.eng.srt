1
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,489
okay we're going to start with our first

2
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:37,400
talk for today in which Marco couch is

3
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:37,400
gonna talk about building the school 2.0

4
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,820
thank you everyone I want to say good

5
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,599
morning first because I think that a lot

6
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,879
of you just woke up I know I have so

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,769
this talk is gonna be a lengthy one and

8
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,040
I apologize in advance for a lot of

9
00:00:52,769 --> 00:01:00,059
these abstract notions that this is

10
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:04,229
thought to represent the talk itself is

11
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,690
a product of five years work and it's

12
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,610
trying to question a lot of things that

13
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,158
the current educational system is you

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,720
know imposing on us in a sense so I'm

15
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,549
going to try to communicate that and in

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,490
the best way possible so you can you can

17
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,520
see what school 2.0 should be so as the

18
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,158
slide says building the school 2.0 as is

19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,289
the topic for today before we start I

20
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,789
just want to introduce myself I'm

21
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:33,810
developing his on fit which is an

22
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:36,479
archetype of school 2.0 I work on free

23
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,920
education and I build free schools one

24
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,359
of these three schools as is here in

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,960
Serbia I have you students here from

26
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,990
from that free school I also in my spare

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,130
time if you could call it that way I

28
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:53,369
advise venture capital funds and

29
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,949
startups I try to promote free culture

30
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:59,549
and do a lot work with with free

31
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:02,490
software and I invest in moonshots and

32
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,799
and deeply transformative projects that

33
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,199
have exponential potential for

34
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,819
exponential growth right so that thing

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:15,360
that you can see on screen is actually

36
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:18,899
zonkers website right now I design it so

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,180
if you think about learning you need to

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,670
think about where do we actually learn

39
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,590
things most of our learning is

40
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,780
non-institutional most of our learning

41
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,220
happens on the street with our people

42
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,260
you know in conferences like this and

43
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,730
settings like this you know sharing

44
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,540
experiences so if you look at our

45
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,810
education it's mostly

46
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,640
self-education most of these schools

47
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,010
that we attend today don't really

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,439
provide us with with the knowledge that

49
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,969
we use every day it's a casino set self

50
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,578
education is the only education I

51
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:54,450
believe there is so if you think that

52
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:59,540
notion of self education you do have to

53
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:01,768
think in this time how can we redesign

54
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:05,159
education educational systems to

55
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:08,760
actually be in line with this was this

56
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:12,450
type of learning we're now in this age

57
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,220
of digital transformation everybody are

58
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,720
talking about this transformation sadly

59
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,329
a lot of governments are talking about

60
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,159
digital transformation and you know

61
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:23,280
oftentimes we see that in these services

62
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:27,030
but sadly we also see that in schools in

63
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,250
educational systems government's think

64
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,459
that digitizing education is something

65
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,260
that we inherently have to do you know

66
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,549
taking this offline education adding a

67
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,768
few computers adding some kind of

68
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,680
software and you know we have digitally

69
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:42,780
transformed education but in non Stier

70
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,180
societies you know we do have Commons

71
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,220
most of us know about free software and

72
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,739
and we can see that a lot of common

73
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,169
resources are shared

74
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,729
you know without compensation and that's

75
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:55,979
something that we do it with knowledge

76
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:57,620
to that's something that we often do it

77
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:02,430
with knowledge and we do it in a digital

78
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:04,769
ecosystem right now so if you look at

79
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,319
the current educational system you know

80
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:10,019
the first question we have to we have to

81
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,208
ask is is this the best thing that we

82
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,510
can do right now with all the

83
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:17,190
technological advancements that we have

84
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:20,820
education right now seems to be lagging

85
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:24,780
behind in terms of software in terms of

86
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:27,599
methodology in terms of pedagogy so

87
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:31,549
what's wrong with school now we we have

88
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:33,990
a social dynamic that's wrong on a more

89
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,620
profound level if you look at education

90
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,300
we're basically isolating people inside

91
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,320
and you know trying to teach them about

92
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,330
the world outside

93
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,880
we're actually isolating them and

94
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,590
buildings we're basically providing

95
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,580
isolation as a service especially if you

96
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,469
look at children young children

97
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,180
isolating children and schools is

98
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,930
something that you do as a favor to two

99
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:59,030
parents right oftentimes current

100
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,790
educational systems discourage learning

101
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,219
for you know for the sole purpose of

102
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:07,820
learning something and it discourages

103
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,460
lifelong learning you have eight grades

104
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,820
of elementary school for grades four

105
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:16,010
years of high school for four to five

106
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,860
years of college and that's basically

107
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,440
you have you can stop learning now you

108
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:26,000
know everything right so these things

109
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,710
are something that is very deeply

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,720
implemented in our current educational

111
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:34,310
system you do have limitations to how

112
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:39,590
long you can stay in an institution and

113
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:42,110
learn also we do have this Academy first

114
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,609
view of the world right so the Academy

115
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,960
first through the world is that you're

116
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,730
basically learning so you can progress

117
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,760
to the next level of our care

118
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:53,420
academic learning right you go to high

119
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,430
school you got good grades mostly so you

120
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,110
can go to college and then get good

121
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,170
grades so you can go to a masters degree

122
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,270
program and then you know finally you

123
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,610
kind of get to a dog or something like

124
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,609
that and then you can express yourself

125
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,100
and then you're 35 or 40 in it's a bit

126
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,480
harder on another problem that we have

127
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,520
in a current educational system which is

128
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,960
also very visible now in ecologist but

129
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,810
in high schools and elementary schools

130
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,960
is the cult of the average you have to

131
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:23,150
take a classroom see you know who you're

132
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,549
working with and then you know make up

133
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,489
an average that you can you know teach

134
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:32,570
to because you can't really personalize

135
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:37,090
learning right now so if you look at the

136
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:39,800
traits of school 1.0 its offline first

137
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,150
knowledge is very fragmented when I say

138
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,270
the knowledge is fragmented I mean if

139
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,739
you have some piece of information that

140
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,120
could be valuable that's knowledge to

141
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:52,370
someone you oftentimes have teachers

142
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,170
just you know telling that to their

143
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,090
students and then another teacher in

144
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,340
another school is doing the same work

145
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:01,340
for the same type of information and

146
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,570
that just you know it's repeated a lot

147
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,890
of times

148
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,050
a lot of times we use proprietary

149
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,630
software especially here in Serbia you

150
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,880
can see that there is no common shared

151
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,500
resource so there is no network there is

152
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,719
no infrastructure for teachers to

153
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,480
actually share data share information

154
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,670
share knowledge - it's mostly you know

155
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,280
self-organized if if it exists at all

156
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:24,530
it's not a job and you can see that now

157
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,169
when the digital transformation era is

158
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:33,710
that every time we try to implement some

159
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:35,480
kind of tech curriculum we end up you

160
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,039
know lagging behind five years because

161
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,020
you know it takes a lot of time to

162
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,660
change curricula things takes a lot of

163
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,520
time to implement that in a system

164
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,470
educate teachers a lot of these things

165
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,960
happen very structured in a structured

166
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,700
manner but it takes a lot of time we

167
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,280
don't really leverage technology for

168
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:56,440
evaluation evaluation is still I don't

169
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,440
know how many of you are from Serbia

170
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,710
yeah so you know there's a one to five

171
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:05,840
grade system or there so after a but we

172
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:08,659
still use that kind of a kind of system

173
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,119
when I spoke to teachers I asked them so

174
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,610
here what's a five and they say it

175
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,010
depends so you have a quantitative

176
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,410
system for measuring knowledge but it

177
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,420
depends it depends from person to person

178
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:23,360
from to defeat teacher from school to

179
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,490
school so you know you end up with you

180
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,430
know five numbers that don't really

181
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,680
they're not really portable you can't

182
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,000
really work with that and we don't

183
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,560
personalize we don't adapt this

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,909
knowledge to to every student which is

185
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,750
something that technology can can help

186
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:44,329
us do but more about that later on so

187
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,550
with the advent of Internet we started

188
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,890
thinking about okay let's build online

189
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,380
education I mean we have the internet

190
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:54,290
right so this is this is a unlimited

191
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,000
infrastructure we can use so the first

192
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,040
core problem that we start with is that

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,040
we wanted to take offline education that

194
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,260
we know and you know we grew up in that

195
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,530
system we want to take that and just put

196
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,300
it on the Internet so in the 90s people

197
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,250
would sell books online and you know you

198
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,569
could order book can you get a printed

199
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,820
copy and then we started you know

200
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,700
introducing PDFs and introducing digital

201
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,180
documents

202
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,480
and then in 2000 there was this movement

203
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,709
called

204
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,030
open educational resources of all yars

205
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,190
which basically said okay we have a lot

206
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,740
of knowledge but we don't have a legal

207
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,560
framework to actually share them between

208
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,870
universities let's build something so

209
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,630
they did they built a legal framework

210
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,300
where you as a student or a researcher

211
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,580
or an academic can take your knowledge

212
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,770
license it openly and share with other

213
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,990
people in the institutions that also

214
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:49,439
includes open access textbooks so

215
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:51,780
students in Western Europe countries can

216
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,060
actually you know take textbooks for for

217
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:58,800
colleges and just you know get them as

218
00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:00,689
an open source content open content in

219
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,630
2010 which is something that probably

220
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,790
everyone remembers is the MOOC Kiera how

221
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:09,930
many of you have ever started working on

222
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:14,099
Coursera EDX MIT OpenCourseWare I can't

223
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:17,370
Hiddink a lot yeah myself too so we had

224
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,010
this we had this movement of like let's

225
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:24,720
educate the masses right it's a very

226
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:30,150
popular movement Coursera had 58 million

227
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:33,000
people joining in on courses and it just

228
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:35,040
crashed no one knew why some people knew

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,160
why but you know they really can explain

230
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,770
it so the MOOCs are not really popular

231
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,660
today right and you can see that as a

232
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:46,140
problem of infrastructure and a problem

233
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:48,540
of dynamics that this kind of online

234
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:52,199
education provides in essence online

235
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,540
education is not online immediately it's

236
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,650
offline education that's trying to you

237
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,650
know present itself is online education

238
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:04,440
okay so back to the ers what's the

239
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:08,220
what's the problem with the way ours

240
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,020
Louie ours exists colleges use it

241
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,050
universities use it especially in Europe

242
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:16,100
and North America a lot of universities

243
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:18,030
used ers the problem is it's mostly

244
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,940
academia it's mostly people from

245
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,410
universities mostly researchers and not

246
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,990
a lot of students know about this thing

247
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,500
because it's a legal framework you as a

248
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,640
student go in and you know

249
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,810
that's not something that that's not the

250
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,030
first thing you learn about your

251
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:35,060
textbooks is that this is legally an

252
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,370
open content you can use it you can

253
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,949
share it not while the students actually

254
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:42,710
think about it

255
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:44,980
quality issues started popping up as Oh

256
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:49,150
ers started you know being widespread

257
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:51,620
it's in moderation and in you know

258
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:55,250
interaction between stakeholders a lot

259
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,560
of universities found it very hard to

260
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:01,310
actually get someone to evaluate a

261
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:05,930
textbook just do a simple moderation

262
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:10,099
work review whatever that's mostly due

263
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:14,329
to lack of discoverability and lack of

264
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,740
funding and also we had started you know

265
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,270
seeing that we are not really

266
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,540
sustainable because they live in this

267
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:22,760
very closed ecosystem of you know higher

268
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:26,240
academia so you people who are you know

269
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,220
postgrads researchers and Institute's so

270
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,830
we ours are really hard to implement

271
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,360
because government and legislators don't

272
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,000
really know about all we are is enough

273
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,560
and don't really care enough especially

274
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,460
in countries like Serbia where you have

275
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:44,500
you know different I would say factories

276
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:48,530
that produce and mass-produce textbooks

277
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:51,020
so MOOCs MOOCs were supposed to be like

278
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:53,420
the thing that just changes the whole

279
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,970
humanity right everybody can just go

280
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,410
learn something they got a degree but

281
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,680
that's not important because it's online

282
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:03,890
and three so the problem with MOOCs is

283
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,109
that you have a bad social dynamic the

284
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,420
only good thing about schools for kids

285
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:11,630
now is that they can see other people

286
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:13,760
you know they can share experiences they

287
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:16,640
can make friends they build their own

288
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,600
networks right in MOOCs you're basically

289
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,890
taking the whole offline education

290
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,540
separating the good part taking the bad

291
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,610
part and putting on the internet and

292
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,110
you're like yeah I can click now it's

293
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,089
like that that that was not the point

294
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,610
and that's something that they didn't

295
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:33,860
realize immediately because suddenly you

296
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:37,070
had 58 million people people on on one

297
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:39,410
platform it's like this is probably good

298
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,940
but then after they started

299
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:45,140
commercializing

300
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:46,280
they've seen a sudden drop to 54,000

301
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,380
people who were actually paying for

302
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,300
courses so that led to another

303
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,250
conclusions that the business model

304
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,689
behind the whole thing is that you don't

305
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,490
have a business model you just started

306
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,590
building something got a lot of capital

307
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,360
and you're like uh-huh okay what one now

308
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:03,290
what we do now

309
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,560
it wasn't sustainable again human

310
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:08,599
interaction between stakeholders was

311
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,920
very bad if you're in Serbia or you know

312
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,100
you're in India and you have to

313
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,709
communicate with someone in the US who's

314
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,150
a lecturer it's very hard there is a

315
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:19,480
language barrier there's you know

316
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:21,590
usually connectivity issues cultural

317
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,510
issues you know different cultures

318
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:25,370
different communications a lot of these

319
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,900
things that were not taking that they

320
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,930
were taking for granted and not really

321
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:32,300
seriously is that we have inherit

322
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:35,050
cultural differences it doesn't make

323
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,729
sense to build one global thing

324
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:39,020
technology availability was also an

325
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,940
issue you had a lot of people from India

326
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,610
coming to MOOCs but not a lot of people

327
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,670
from Africa because not a lot of people

328
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:49,460
in Africa have you know good high

329
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,810
bandwidth internet and oftentimes they

330
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,580
don't have electricity throughout the

331
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:56,510
whole day which is another problem you

332
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:59,930
know you're building this for the

333
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:02,870
uneducated part of the world quote marks

334
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,609
but you're actually building it on

335
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,870
technologists available you know in the

336
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:11,750
valley or you know in the urban US right

337
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:14,830
so you had this disparity of how how

338
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:18,410
often do you have people who are

339
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:21,100
connected properly in Africa as they are

340
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:24,170
in New York right and then retention

341
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:27,350
when someone goes into a web site says

342
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,550
you can join for free you're free you

343
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,650
don't need a credit card okay just one

344
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,099
click and then you're like oh that was

345
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:36,050
easy

346
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:38,510
I have other things to do the problem is

347
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:41,689
you you couldn't really keep people on

348
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,939
the platform because the first time they

349
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:47,060
run into a bump or they don't know what

350
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:49,970
to do they have questions you don't have

351
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,119
a person next to you to ask you don't

352
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,829
know how to ask

353
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,439
you know you have to participate you

354
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:56,969
have to be actively participating

355
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:59,879
participating in those communities

356
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:05,309
online which prove which has proved not

357
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:06,420
to be very very user friendly so the

358
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:08,610
conclusion of this

359
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:11,790
let's build online education is that it

360
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:16,740
was not really brave between 1999 and

361
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:18,329
today last 20 years the audience has

362
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,069
changed dramatically

363
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:22,649
you know kids today have mobile phones

364
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:24,689
they're digital natives and the goals

365
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,790
have changed we are transitioning most

366
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:31,349
of the worlds and transitioning now to a

367
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:32,849
you know a capital market economy some

368
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,189
other parts of the world you know are

369
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,420
stagnating there's there's it's not a

370
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:39,449
unipolar world anymore

371
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,910
the society has changed technology has

372
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:44,248
changed look at the Internet in the 1999

373
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,719
and look at Internet today look at the

374
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:47,699
bandwidth look at the technology that we

375
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,899
have look at mobile homes just mobile

376
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,370
phones are great representative

377
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:54,689
difference that we have in the last 20

378
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:57,899
years so what's the goal of building an

379
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:59,279
actual school 2.0 it has to be a

380
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,350
revolution but it doesn't have to be a

381
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,020
pile in one it needs to be a modest

382
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:06,990
revolution because we already have the

383
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,750
technology needed to build a new school

384
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:13,109
a new educational system we just need a

385
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:16,140
consensus on pedagogy and on the model

386
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:17,639
and on a lot of these things are truly

387
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,100
human and emotional and not

388
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,039
technological because if you look at

389
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:24,839
technology a PDF is also a book but it's

390
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,879
not a book but it's not really a digital

391
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,510
document you can't really do a lot of

392
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,350
things while if you do you know HTML you

393
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,899
can do a lot of things with that

394
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:39,899
document that's the same thing that we

395
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:41,520
have with with changing education now we

396
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:44,039
already have technology we don't have

397
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,610
the consensus on how to do that how to

398
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:49,799
change education so the first principle

399
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,090
of Education 2.0 is that has to be free

400
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:54,389
by default when I say if free I don't

401
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:58,129
mean free as in gratis I mean free as in

402
00:17:54,390 --> 00:18:02,070
freedom because not a lot of things

403
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:03,730
outside digital space are free and money

404
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,470
so we do have the

405
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,200
take that into account but it doesn't

406
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,760
mean building a market around education

407
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,870
and that's something that we can see in

408
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,330
our society today

409
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,679
one of the worst traits of our society

410
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:18,870
today is that we've built a market

411
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:21,670
economy around education and health care

412
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:24,899
so why is this a problem you know you

413
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:28,930
have huge publishers that are taking

414
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:31,090
immense amounts of money trying to build

415
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:33,160
an economy around education you know

416
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:36,070
we've seen that with people who actually

417
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:38,200
fought this you know you have a good

418
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:41,649
example is Aaron Schwartz sadly is not

419
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,960
amongst us anymore but we we see that on

420
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:46,360
his example is that people who try to

421
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,600
liberate knowledge were prosecuted

422
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,060
severely and you know shunned out of

423
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:58,149
society for trying to provide free

424
00:18:52,060 --> 00:19:00,129
knowledge to everyone we do if you look

425
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:06,610
at free software we see that every

426
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:10,000
resource that takes zero amount of cost

427
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:12,100
to produce is something that we can

428
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,410
convert to a common so a lot of people

429
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,209
who are willing to donate their time

430
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:18,310
don't have expenses toward you know

431
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,350
building free software it's it's not

432
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:23,169
very easy as we can see free software is

433
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:26,649
sadly not sustainable enough but we can

434
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:28,830
see that if the amount of the cost for

435
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:31,000
production is negligible we can just

436
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,470
share that as a common and that's

437
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,190
something that we need to strive toward

438
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:38,710
for a post-scarcity society converting

439
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,660
our economy to a commons peer based

440
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:43,360
production is something that we can do

441
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:47,400
if you know we can get the cost of

442
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:50,050
production to be zero or near zero I

443
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,460
think that one of the biggest principles

444
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:54,159
in education right now should be

445
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,050
denouncing competition and MOOCs are

446
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,560
were the opposite of that MOOCs were

447
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:01,810
where a university and EURion University

448
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,909
and we're just going to compete on the

449
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:06,550
same platform which is insane you have

450
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:09,940
Howard and Stanford who had their own

451
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:11,620
lectures who built courses they invested

452
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,200
a lot of time they'd invested a lot of

453
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:17,080
money in that and then you basically had

454
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,490
two courses on the same topic from the

455
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,159
universities who are competing each

456
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,230
other well you know in the same time

457
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,590
they could produce some one course that

458
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:30,250
was you know are some of the best that

459
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:31,629
they can do one more thing is really

460
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,490
important that's that's something that I

461
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,140
mentioned previously technology is not

462
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,510
the problem we don't have a problem with

463
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:40,780
technology we have the tools to build

464
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:44,379
this we have a lack of consensus amongst

465
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,180
humans so most of our modern education

466
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,410
digital education has presented by

467
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:50,050
governments and then different

468
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:51,820
for-profit entities that we need to

469
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:54,669
learn so we can be valuable in the

470
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,620
industry you're learning to be a you

471
00:20:54,670 --> 00:21:00,370
know cog in someone's you know machine

472
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:04,959
know before you know even in the Eastern

473
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:07,179
Europe you had this value through

474
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,400
authority you're learning so the

475
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,560
government can just put a stamp on your

476
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,860
diploma and you're you know you you're

477
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:17,290
not authorized to be knowledgeable but

478
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,389
never in this evolution of education

479
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,190
have we had a movement that said let's

480
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,350
just learn for this sort of sole purpose

481
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:26,160
of being better human beings and this is

482
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,159
a problem than we have today

483
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,730
so education 2.0 education in general

484
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,500
should be a public resource this is

485
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,910
something that we need a that we need to

486
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,260
share with other people and liberal

487
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,700
acknowledge has proven to be very

488
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,550
difficult but if we start building

489
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,680
purposes that are free from beginning we

490
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,149
can actually we can actually achieve

491
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,410
that public resource because we start

492
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:49,300
you're building it free by default right

493
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,800
so what should the school 2.0 be some

494
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,450
basic principles is that it should be

495
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,810
free as in freedom and it shouldn't be

496
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,850
really free as in beer right if we have

497
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:00,070
logistics or infrastructure cause that's

498
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:03,389
something that we can cover there is no

499
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:06,129
need to build a market around education

500
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,990
this is something that one of the

501
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,870
plagues of today's society is building a

502
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,400
market economy around education you know

503
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,050
we can teach and share the costs you

504
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,260
know this could be a peer based

505
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:19,000
production of knowledge another thing is

506
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,710
that it should be crowd-sourced meaning

507
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,440
you know denouncing competition being

508
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:25,210
singular and being peer-reviewed is

509
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,150
something that's that's very valuable

510
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,560
and it's proven to be very good for

511
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,010
projects like Wikipedia a lot of people

512
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,169
say

513
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:35,410
no this can't be none say look at

514
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:37,960
Wikipedia Wikipedia has done it look in

515
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:39,910
MOOCs MOOCs have done it in in a sense

516
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,910
sadly they have an open source their

517
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:45,130
their courses yet but hopefully when

518
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:47,860
they finally die out we can see a lot of

519
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:50,860
that material open it should be personal

520
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,620
adaptive you can hear a lot of things

521
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,719
today a lot of good things about

522
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,370
artificial intelligence sort of say you

523
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,490
know glorified statistics applied

524
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:03,729
statistics a lot of the technology that

525
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,320
we have right now can help us adapt to

526
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,730
particular students which is something

527
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,040
that we're basically not leveraging at

528
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:11,320
all it should be made cravaack meaning

529
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,870
if you can actually like Wikipedia if

530
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,280
you can actually provide us with the

531
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,439
value and you provide obviously with

532
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,840
value and you get value in return that's

533
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,120
a good system right but most importantly

534
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,949
it should be biomimetic and that's

535
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:28,149
something that is started in the talk

536
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:31,090
with you should have processes that you

537
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:33,130
know you observe in nature if people are

538
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,139
learning in a particular way don't build

539
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:37,000
a school that says no this way that

540
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,410
you're being it's been very successful

541
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,940
we've been doing that for a long time

542
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:44,470
but we're gonna build something that's

543
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:48,160
not that because we can school should be

544
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:50,440
biomimetic because people have a good

545
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,480
mechanism for learning we just need to

546
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,520
cultivate it we don't need to go against

547
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,100
it right another thing is you know being

548
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,840
free of curricula agenda that's

549
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,639
something very hard to pitch the

550
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,050
government's the government's you know

551
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,090
really like that you know having a

552
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:07,000
curriculum because you have this job

553
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:09,429
market and you need to fill up but you

554
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,740
know curricula eyes are in essence

555
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:13,450
oppression against knowledge you know

556
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,720
people people generally don't think

557
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:18,420
about that but if you look at that if

558
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,890
you have a curricular you're limited in

559
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:24,580
sense of what you are allowed to learn

560
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:26,800
and what's really evaluated in schools

561
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,110
and it should be obviously the universal

562
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,230
meaning you know being adaptive to

563
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,280
language and cultural differences

564
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,540
localization is a big part of that again

565
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,820
the Wikipedia is a good example of how

566
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:41,710
that's done kinda okay so the ideal

567
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,879
implementation is that you know we have

568
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,550
all these principles in this

569
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,340
right which is openly and transparently

570
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:50,740
governed it has an open and common

571
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,139
infrastructure and the schools are built

572
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,090
as platforms if you look at software

573
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,770
it's easy to is the easy to look to

574
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:58,510
understand it's how do you build a

575
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,710
platform you you build an API you build

576
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:02,350
something that you can build on top of

577
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:05,050
write its platform you'd build on top of

578
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:07,419
that and it's insane how how schools are

579
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,340
not structured like that today if you

580
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,470
have a job market why wouldn't the job

581
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,780
market be able to tap into school

582
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:16,960
why wouldn't a school have an API when

583
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:18,510
people in schools have api's and we

584
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,450
still don't think about that enough and

585
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:25,150
again leaving the space for for-profit

586
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,790
and competition is important in a you

587
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:32,710
know market economy because you know you

588
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:35,110
people depend on on money and but needs

589
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:37,320
to be on top of that platform not the

590
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:41,709
base of a platform itself

591
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,110
why profit is so problematic in

592
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,580
education is that if you look at

593
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:47,560
for-profit universities especially in

594
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,929
North America you're going to see that

595
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,120
if an organization is basically charging

596
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:54,970
you for education they're their job is

597
00:25:52,120 --> 00:26:00,550
not to educate you it's to take your

598
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:02,680
money so the whole system of principles

599
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:04,470
changes from their side you know they're

600
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:08,380
here to charge you for something and

601
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:12,010
that's that first goal one of the most

602
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:13,690
important things in this stakeholder

603
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:15,970
communication and consensus is that we

604
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,790
should have open pedagogy if you're a

605
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:20,470
good teacher you should be able as a

606
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:22,389
part of the system to teach other people

607
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,760
how to do the same thing that you doing

608
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:29,050
how how do you present knowledge how are

609
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:30,910
you co-creator or mentor to people and

610
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,830
this is something that's in very early

611
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:35,110
stages right now but that's something

612
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:38,260
that we need to have a consensus on

613
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:39,459
especially in the academia right now so

614
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,840
what are the challenges of employing

615
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:45,400
this establishment governing bodies

616
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,600
probably going to be a lot harder than

617
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,550
people think

618
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,409
just getting the consensus on these

619
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,950
things and it's going to take years

620
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,920
probably

621
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:55,330
and then sustainability the the model

622
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,000
that I'm going to present you later on

623
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:59,300
is

624
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,950
that is going to probably explain the

625
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:05,120
sustainability part in a bit more detail

626
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:08,510
building core infrastructure is

627
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,429
something that we as you know free

628
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:12,590
software contributors can do building

629
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:15,680
free software that you can use reuse in

630
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:19,550
other schools exchange adapt to cultures

631
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:21,350
adapt to needs adapt to millions but we

632
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,270
need to build one of that you know you

633
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,159
can build one virtual learning

634
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:27,860
environment you don't need to media

635
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,310
wiki's you know you don't need to linux

636
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,469
kernel's

637
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:32,450
well if you're google you do but you

638
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:34,070
don't need to linux kernel's you know

639
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,930
you need different drivers and that's

640
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:38,659
the same the same architecture we can

641
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:40,280
apply to education of course licensing

642
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,650
and adoption is gonna be hard but this

643
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,899
is more of an illegal side that i don't

644
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:48,430
want to go into now we didn't know how

645
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:50,780
leg leads can be a bit tricky thank you

646
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:52,850
why do you think the challenges I

647
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,200
mentioned previously that not a lot of

648
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:56,780
people have access to the Internet you

649
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,920
know we are the lucky ones there is

650
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,480
still a lot of people in the world who

651
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,600
don't have the the access to basic

652
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:06,470
things like electricity there's a

653
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,449
there's a huge gap in access to personal

654
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,160
computing units if you look at mobile

655
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:14,600
phones mobile phones are not really a

656
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:17,240
computing unit that you can learn on in

657
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:21,139
the same way they can learn on a laptop

658
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:23,360
right and we still have a lack of that

659
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,760
person computing unit in a sense that we

660
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,100
have as developers as people who are you

661
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,780
know hacking away on something digital

662
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,389
literacy is also a huge problem there

663
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:34,879
was a picture a few days ago that in

664
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:37,640
Serbia kids in seventh grade actually

665
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,100
draw the whole Microsoft Word UI in

666
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,620
their notebooks which is which is cool

667
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,689
if you're in art class

668
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,100
but we have a problem with digital

669
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:50,300
literacy a lot of people don't know like

670
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:53,419
word and LibreOffice or you know what

671
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,860
slippery office is that word know that

672
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,920
it's the same thing you you write

673
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:00,350
documents it's like no I just I just no

674
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,600
word right there's there's no other

675
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:03,679
thing so we do have that when they're

676
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,230
locking and we have a lot of these

677
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,370
things that we don't feel as people for

678
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:11,970
you know technically savvy but

679
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:15,408
a lot of common people do okay so the

680
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:17,130
base model for this says if we have an

681
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:20,100
architectural model of how this

682
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:23,659
education should look then you know we

683
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:26,219
can start from the base we do need

684
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:27,960
principles and you know we need a

685
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,850
governing body and we need a standards

686
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,120
and that's something that you can see in

687
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:34,260
organizations like w3c or IETF a lot of

688
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,510
these organizations have the same

689
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,220
principle of you know building standards

690
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,710
having committees that focus on

691
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,309
different things right w3c is probably a

692
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:48,419
good example of that not a lot of people

693
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:50,190
can you know say that I want to do all

694
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,990
these things that are including an

695
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,850
education but if you have a committee on

696
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,340
accessibility if you have a committee on

697
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:57,959
localization you can separate that that

698
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,908
work amongst people who are actually

699
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,490
interested in that so the governance

700
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:03,980
part is very very basic you take the

701
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,990
models that work right now in

702
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,549
organizations like w3c and in

703
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,440
infrastructure you know you're basically

704
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:13,679
building this for people that's the part

705
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,120
of anthropogenic education you're

706
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,620
building this for people but then you're

707
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,570
building infrastructure that these

708
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,239
people can share right so we'll put

709
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:22,408
building free software for example if

710
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,330
we're building a virtual learning

711
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:25,649
environment

712
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:29,309
we're building that's free software and

713
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:32,309
everybody can take it adapt it we

714
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:33,899
distributed use it in schools also the

715
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:36,240
corpuses of knowledge is something

716
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:39,809
that's fundamental to this model is that

717
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,899
we're building content corpuses that are

718
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:45,539
free and open you can add to it you can

719
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:47,750
review it you can you know fight other

720
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:50,610
people it's like Wikipedia but better

721
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:53,159
and then there's the force data you know

722
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:54,418
every data point that we can generate is

723
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:56,399
something that should be a part that

724
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,950
open infrastructure that you know you

725
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:04,830
have as a common shared amongst all

726
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:07,080
these so I didn't want to have this on

727
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:09,870
the abstract so three years ago I

728
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,939
started this project it's this basically

729
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:15,299
an archetype of school 2.0 and it's

730
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:17,850
called on fit the goals for us were

731
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:20,070
let's limit us to one application let's

732
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:21,689
limit us to building a free corpus of

733
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:24,010
computer science knowledge

734
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,930
building this free school infrastructure

735
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:28,830
a learning environment you know the

736
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:31,270
tools that you need the communication

737
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:34,929
testing the requirements is this really

738
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:37,600
possible is this a pipe dream and to

739
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:40,240
test if this can you know be sustainable

740
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,490
okay can maybe can work today but does

741
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,090
it you know and do her a year or two and

742
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:50,470
it was it was very very challenging and

743
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:52,149
it's an ongoing project right now but we

744
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,800
start with simple features we start with

745
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:56,080
a virtual learning environment and an

746
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,000
offline learning environment something

747
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,379
that most of us are familiar with and

748
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,410
then we added a couple of things we

749
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:05,740
added identity platforms and we add an

750
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:08,710
API the API was also a data platform and

751
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:11,500
we started you know investigating how

752
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:15,010
can we you know build a proper social

753
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:17,140
dynamic emulating real environments

754
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,760
working on real projects free software

755
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,470
is also a good part of that because you

756
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,990
know free software is very easy to

757
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:25,420
access students can go into free

758
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,490
software and say ok I can see the code I

759
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,110
can inspect I can learn something I can

760
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,490
see what other people did so they

761
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:33,510
started actually contributing to free

762
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:37,150
software so now we have the school right

763
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:38,500
now meaning three years after we had the

764
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:41,080
school and then you have a learning

765
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,030
environment which can be offline or

766
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:46,030
online you have the software for the

767
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:48,639
online environment that's also you know

768
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:51,460
inheriting all that corpus and software

769
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,890
and data and that software is providing

770
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:56,679
you an API for data or identities and

771
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:59,140
now you'd have a school that a company

772
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:01,960
can tap into you have a school that has

773
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:04,240
an API so you as a company for example a

774
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,429
recruiting marketplace can tap into a

775
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,260
school right you can get a lot of

776
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:09,760
information about people about their

777
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:12,370
skills about their necessities in the

778
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,770
job market and you know through that API

779
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:17,800
you're you have built a school that's a

780
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:21,639
platform the other people people can use

781
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,770
the identity part of that is that you as

782
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,540
a student can only your identity and

783
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:27,520
ideally this identity part would be a

784
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,530
part of the core infrastructure later on

785
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:32,899
as you know schools with reach a

786
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:36,379
consensus of how to share or not share

787
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:38,238
any information open ID is a good

788
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:41,748
example of how this fad that can be done

789
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:44,149
as a federated a technology but ideally

790
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:46,580
students would be able to take part in

791
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:48,349
any school without the school actually

792
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:52,668
owning their identities as our schools

793
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:55,249
you know so what could we do with this

794
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:57,849
school what can you do with this that

795
00:33:55,249 --> 00:34:00,889
you can't do with a college or something

796
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:05,539
so ideally you know you have a lot of

797
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:08,629
data right and you can do a lot of stuff

798
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:11,059
with data as we've seen a lot of nice

799
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:13,399
companies that we trust our data with

800
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:15,349
every day so one of the things that we

801
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:16,520
could measure outcomes and you know by

802
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:18,079
measuring outcomes you have a lot of

803
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,629
data of how people perform in different

804
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,369
situations if you're scenarios and we

805
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:24,288
started thinking about can we build

806
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:28,010
algal generated pads can you actually

807
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:30,799
find the best way to learn something by

808
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:34,909
using the data that people generate can

809
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:38,000
the platform say this is by far the best

810
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:40,309
way or you know data substantiated the

811
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,639
best way to learn something because

812
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:44,839
people would have performed better

813
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,270
many people have performed better in

814
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:49,639
this path right so you know using

815
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:51,589
behavioral analytics you could improve

816
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:53,659
outcomes for people didn't help them

817
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,940
learn you could help them not go into a

818
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:59,150
wall you know because they don't know

819
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:03,260
how to approach a certain topic another

820
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:06,410
thing is that how could you really build

821
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:08,390
that kind of visual learning is that you

822
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:10,190
need to have something that's machine

823
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,230
readable as a document but you need

824
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,720
people to compile their code or show

825
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:17,000
their graphics on right we can't do that

826
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,419
with markdown we can't do that with you

827
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,099
know HTML without a lot of add-ons so we

828
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:25,670
started out with a smart document we

829
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:27,890
took ODF and we thought about how can we

830
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:32,180
make this machine readable how can we

831
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:33,589
make this you know run a virtual machine

832
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:36,470
as a container as an autonomous

833
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:39,710
container inside a document so you can

834
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:42,379
compile code and a lot of this is a part

835
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:44,599
of our research with Jupiter a lot of

836
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,820
you maybe know about Jupiter is that you

837
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:47,400
can

838
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,290
actually run code inside a notebook it's

839
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,840
a live notebook so we wanted to build a

840
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:54,300
smart document you can tap into the

841
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,450
document has an API that document has a

842
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,670
virtual machine and you can run code

843
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:02,430
inside of it in an autonomous container

844
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,680
this would allow us to build a knowledge

845
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:07,379
graph the documents would be able to

846
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,390
communicate amongst each other sharing

847
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,040
data and the documents themselves with

848
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:15,450
the data points we wouldn't have to have

849
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:17,820
a spark sparkle database or a linked

850
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:20,069
data knowledge trap we could use the

851
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:24,390
document that people generate to build a

852
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:26,360
crowdsource knowledge graph a few more

853
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:29,879
things that we experimented with was

854
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,890
algo generated content which is very

855
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,160
cool but you know in very early stages

856
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:37,680
is you know basically teaching teaching

857
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,109
an engine to go to the internet and just

858
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,419
learn about or actually tell you about a

859
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:46,290
different topic just by using the

860
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:48,720
Internet as a learning tool it we had

861
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,310
some interesting responses to say the

862
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,509
least

863
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:53,580
learning companion BOTS if you have a

864
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:56,460
bot that's your personal mentor just

865
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:59,640
reminding you you can actually help

866
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:02,820
people stay on course improving

867
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:05,069
retention you know you have a lot of

868
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,380
people who using messenger a lot of

869
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:10,170
these proprietary platforms are slack

870
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:13,110
and they use it every day why would you

871
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,700
leverage the the community and the

872
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,380
ecosystem that these companies have

873
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:19,109
built to actually provide students with

874
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:22,320
some BOTS that can help them stay on

875
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:24,270
track social augmentation engine is a

876
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,370
cool tank with the data that we gather

877
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:29,430
we can actually find out who's the best

878
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:33,120
fit for a team with a certain parameters

879
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:35,310
and when you go to a recruiting company

880
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:39,089
and then you say we have a lot of data

881
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:43,620
and then they say ok so how is that

882
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:47,030
better than a CV or a resume you say

883
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:49,950
well we can we can know we have a static

884
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:52,050
analysis running on every code commit

885
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:54,419
that people make so you can see through

886
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:56,610
time how they've progressed through

887
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,410
their learning so you can see their code

888
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:00,329
improvements they can see you know the

889
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,859
style how they've implemented new

890
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:03,180
libraries how they implement new

891
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:06,930
technologies and you can see that your

892
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:09,240
time there huh okay that sounds fun so

893
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:12,029
you have an immense amount of power with

894
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,500
a data right also the impact analysis if

895
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:15,720
you're contributing to this you should

896
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,520
know how you've impacted the whole

897
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,470
community how you have packed with other

898
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,109
people so we started building an

899
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:24,419
analysis engine to tell you okay you

900
00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:27,359
contributed yesterday so this is a part

901
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,829
that you know has reached this amount of

902
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,660
people helped this amount of people to

903
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:33,740
learn something which is very valuable

904
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:36,420
for people who are contributing right

905
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,979
also a consensus the planet evaluation

906
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:41,609
is something that's that's a core thing

907
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:44,069
so avoiding authoritative evaluation

908
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:46,109
your stamp on a diploma is very hard

909
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:47,970
because how do you validate knowledge if

910
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:50,450
you look at how we evaluate knowledge in

911
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:52,439
nature you know we have different

912
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:54,960
scenarios where people can prove their

913
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:58,920
knowledge through work to presentation

914
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:01,079
you know to different papers and people

915
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,720
build trust so we're building a trust

916
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:06,900
model around evaluation you know saying

917
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,279
I trust that you're you know you know

918
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,720
what you're talking about not just me

919
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:12,210
other people trust you so we're building

920
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,848
the consensus evaluation saying okay now

921
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:17,940
I kind of think that society has agreed

922
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:19,140
upon you being an expert right and of

923
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,819
course you know with the data and

924
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:23,670
digital landscape you have new

925
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:26,670
opportunity for didactics Alexa is a

926
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:31,829
good thing if you exclude the whole

927
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:35,970
privacy concern if you build that kind

928
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:37,470
of technology you can use hopefully the

929
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:40,558
similar thing but free and open source

930
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:42,270
to you know read to people Alexa can

931
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:45,390
read to people it's very simple it's a

932
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:46,980
it's a simple skill to learn so people

933
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:50,069
can actually get these very simple very

934
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:54,299
basic value for good that simple value

935
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:56,520
for an Alexa right then we started

936
00:39:54,299 --> 00:40:01,500
thinking about this okay how do we adapt

937
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:03,150
this to a market economy people have

938
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,500
recruitment tools you know you have

939
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,329
angel list you have a lot of these

940
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,349
platforms that just take people's data

941
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:11,390
and they recruit people or you know

942
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:14,239
sell you the data for people that you

943
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:16,640
can later hire so you can build ETS

944
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:19,549
tools or you can build legitimate tools

945
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,229
on top of on top of school you can build

946
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:23,749
a mentoring marketplace so if people

947
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:26,209
want to pay someone for their time to

948
00:40:23,749 --> 00:40:27,649
mentor them actually people can actually

949
00:40:26,209 --> 00:40:31,069
build something on top of a school and

950
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:34,160
say now I leverage your API to you know

951
00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:36,410
offer you my time and you can pay for it

952
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,819
the adaptive tools of course you know

953
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:39,558
every kind of didactical you can think

954
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:41,479
about is something they can tap into

955
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:43,849
because you have a school that has an

956
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:45,140
API a lot of the things that we in

957
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:47,239
software take for granted

958
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:49,940
we don't have an education so this

959
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:51,380
example is let's just take the things

960
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,059
that we take for granted in just simple

961
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,799
manner school that that leverages the

962
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:55,309
technology that we have and of course a

963
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:57,109
lot of bots

964
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:59,690
and I'd be kind of odd even the stupid

965
00:40:57,109 --> 00:41:02,180
wants what to get gifts or gifts or

966
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:05,059
whatever you want to call it so if you

967
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:07,009
can get a bot that helps retention then

968
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:09,079
you've successfully managed to leverage

969
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:12,019
Facebook's infrastructure to help people

970
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:13,759
to stay on track so now finally you have

971
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:16,189
this Federation model which has a

972
00:41:13,759 --> 00:41:17,599
ecosystem on top of a school which

973
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:21,319
basically allows you to grow a goods or

974
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,479
services as a third party not integrated

975
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:25,969
into school not owning the identity of

976
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:28,218
people who are at the school right not

977
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:30,829
only the data not only in the school

978
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:32,930
meaning governments can build services

979
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:35,749
on top of the school not owning the

980
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:37,910
school it's highly I'm probably that

981
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:40,368
that's gonna happen soon but it's

982
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:41,899
possible companies can actually build on

983
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:43,969
top of a school without owning the

984
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,949
identities without owning personal data

985
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:48,319
of the students that go into schools and

986
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:50,209
they don't have to be integral to the

987
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,038
school they don't have the funds goals

988
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:54,288
they don't have to be the ones who are

989
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:56,239
actually you know making decisions

990
00:41:54,289 --> 00:41:58,279
inside the educational system you have a

991
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:00,619
platform that allows them to be in loop

992
00:41:58,279 --> 00:42:02,390
and to leverage educational systems but

993
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:07,359
you know just just stay out of the stake

994
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:09,680
holding party so what can you do to help

995
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:12,920
you know knowledge exchange is a good

996
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,749
thing anyone that has any ideas eeks I'm

997
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,999
open for it we do have a translation

998
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:18,709
community a lot of that the content that

999
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:20,209
we provide we provide in English or

1000
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:20,569
Serbian so we need a lot of people to

1001
00:42:20,209 --> 00:42:22,850
transfer

1002
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:25,010
obviously we do need help with legal

1003
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:27,319
expertise we do have a great team of

1004
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:30,680
people who help us with legal issues but

1005
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:32,060
of course legal being what it is always

1006
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,399
needs help from people from other

1007
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,860
jurisdictions and people who know

1008
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,600
legislators of course advocating to

1009
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,470
governments and industry stakeholders is

1010
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,450
really important

1011
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:43,490
getting this rolling is not a project

1012
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:47,960
that happens in a year so I know people

1013
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:49,100
who can actually join in and help are

1014
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,600
always appreciated

1015
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,150
if you want to join this question you

1016
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,799
can go we're at on matrix so you in join

1017
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:58,760
us in matrix and just just talk about

1018
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:01,670
this or you can just ping me with any

1019
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:04,520
questions you have and with that I hope

1020
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:06,800
that this wasn't to observe abstract

1021
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:09,100
thank you very much and I'm open for

1022
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,100
questions

1023
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:43,160
listen yeah yeah so if you look at how

1024
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:46,400
different movements have been adapted to

1025
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,259
serve public interests right

1026
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,590
adaptation of free software into

1027
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:56,750
governments the new is 3040 years old

1028
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:59,530
now and you still don't have proper

1029
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:02,990
integration of you know free software in

1030
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:05,480
public infrastructure so if you think

1031
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:08,660
about that it's it's a 30 year long

1032
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,860
battle and governments still don't

1033
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,240
understand how to implement free

1034
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,530
software and free software is something

1035
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,169
that we're you know congregating around

1036
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:17,060
today right so I think this is going to

1037
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:18,500
be very hard and are setting up a

1038
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:21,650
strategy would be you know like a

1039
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:23,960
five-year plan it's it's something that

1040
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:26,980
you can plan for but you know it doesn't

1041
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:31,400
matter I think that free software has

1042
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:33,860
gotten to a point where you have quality

1043
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,540
in quantity like because free software

1044
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:38,630
is a singular economy if you build one

1045
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:40,190
Python library usually if you don't have

1046
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:42,680
a very specific reason for you can

1047
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:46,370
improve on it and you only require that

1048
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:48,680
one for that sole purpose it's very you

1049
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:51,890
know improbable that you're going to

1050
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,419
build another one if this one meets your

1051
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:54,740
demands and you can contribute to it and

1052
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,990
there's a there's an open and

1053
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:59,450
transparent governance of it and that's

1054
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:01,250
the same with education right it's a

1055
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:03,020
single er economy if you build a course

1056
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:05,690
on something and the whole cumin

1057
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:07,759
humanity joins on building some kind of

1058
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:10,880
knowledge you're going to get to a point

1059
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,830
where this quantity is a quality and you

1060
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,130
know as free software today is something

1061
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:18,170
that it's impossible to if you're free

1062
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,700
education is also going to be that maybe

1063
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:22,070
even sooner because you know free

1064
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,330
software is a is an unlimited scope of

1065
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:25,490
software you can build but you know

1066
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:28,009
education is one you know we can we can

1067
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:33,100
build on you know one topic at a time

1068
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:33,100
right so the answer is I don't know

1069
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:32,459
yeah that's the perfect question it's a

1070
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:34,170
very difficult thing to do so one we

1071
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,840
start with markdown and markdown is not

1072
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:40,530
a language it's just an abstraction on

1073
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:42,960
it you just parse text so we've started

1074
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:47,880
you know looking into what we can use as

1075
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:50,060
a base and we landed on ODF so with the

1076
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:53,760
document foundation you know being very

1077
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:56,870
open about the whole open document

1078
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,680
format you have an extensive

1079
00:46:56,870 --> 00:47:02,880
specification how this works

1080
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:05,100
it's an xml-based format which works

1081
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:10,590
really well parsing and it's good for

1082
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:13,220
you know data content portability so the

1083
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:15,360
idea of this document is that the

1084
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:18,750
autonomous container should not be

1085
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:20,940
communicating outside the document there

1086
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:23,580
is an option for this to use an RPC of

1087
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,890
some kind but you know still in in the

1088
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:27,630
prototype phase you have one document

1089
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,609
and you can attach one virtual machine

1090
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,620
to it but it doesn't communicate with

1091
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:33,660
others meaning you have a live notebook

1092
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:35,580
but these notebooks don't really

1093
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:39,540
communicate to throughout the whole

1094
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:42,480
network right just because of the trends

1095
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:45,190
it's very hard to implement so the idea

1096
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,460
of this is can you use

1097
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:52,329
an xml-based format to build a knowledge

1098
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:55,780
graph right the knowledge graph is

1099
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:57,970
usually built in Tripoli based databases

1100
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:00,730
right you have different languages that

1101
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:02,470
can query that data but there's a huge

1102
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:03,549
missed opportunity in Wikipedia for

1103
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:06,509
example where people are actually

1104
00:48:03,549 --> 00:48:09,339
contributing now even structured data

1105
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:11,890
but Wikipedia is not really using it to

1106
00:48:09,339 --> 00:48:14,470
type into wiki data or other projects

1107
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:16,029
that can leverage structured data for

1108
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:18,990
any kind of purpose right

1109
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:23,700
so the idea was take an xml-based format

1110
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:27,038
veldt build a format that can contain

1111
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:31,990
different you know types of educational

1112
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:34,119
content and just by providing structured

1113
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:36,279
data inside of a format and by providing

1114
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:39,220
a virtual machine you have this live

1115
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,960
notebook that looks like Jupiter but you

1116
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,368
also have the option of building an

1117
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,289
engine that can tap into all these

1118
00:48:42,369 --> 00:48:46,599
documents is a network outside of these

1119
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:48,640
autonomous containers not touching upon

1120
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:50,109
that because if you look at the code if

1121
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,180
you look at something it's still the

1122
00:48:50,109 --> 00:48:54,819
content right it can be both static and

1123
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:57,399
dynamic if you need it to be so you can

1124
00:48:54,819 --> 00:48:58,900
tap into that static content and just

1125
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,730
use the structured data for some kind of

1126
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:04,720
analysis or just extracting all that

1127
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:08,770
data out but still having you know both

1128
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:11,140
a static and dynamic format it's you

1129
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:13,779
know it's a huge thing the Odia

1130
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:16,868
specifications over a thousand pages

1131
00:49:13,779 --> 00:49:19,029
long we started building upon ODF

1132
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:22,150
because ODF actually plans in the

1133
00:49:19,029 --> 00:49:24,160
specification to be extended to a smart

1134
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,930
document in the future in any kind of

1135
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,609
possible way so they kind of planned for

1136
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:29,379
it like we left the space for you to

1137
00:49:27,609 --> 00:49:31,538
build a smart document we just didn't

1138
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,730
know how but it's there in specification

1139
00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:35,650
so that's why we chose it it's portable

1140
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,270
you know it's XML it's possible it's not

1141
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:39,460
proprietary you know it's it's

1142
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:41,410
standardized it's you know you have

1143
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:43,329
liberty office or OpenOffice that uses

1144
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:46,390
it you have Microsoft Word that uses it

1145
00:49:43,329 --> 00:49:47,619
if they want so yeah we can talk more

1146
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:49,390
about the actual technical

1147
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:55,710
implementation of the format if you want

1148
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:55,710
I hope that that answered just a bit

1149
00:49:56,359 --> 00:49:59,808
any more questions

1150
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,859
[Music]

1151
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,300
yeah it depends on the implementation if

1152
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:31,629
you take like the first initial idea for

1153
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:34,660
us is if we built a federated identity

1154
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:36,900
service right you as a student you as

1155
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:39,640
the identity owner can actually control

1156
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:41,500
the data you provide to every each

1157
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,970
application that requests for it I mean

1158
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:46,330
it's a bad example but think about what

1159
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:48,669
- for example you're allowing access to

1160
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:51,880
a resource right so you as an identity

1161
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:53,970
provider have a container with your data

1162
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,869
and inside that container you have your

1163
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:57,939
learning parameters you have your

1164
00:50:55,869 --> 00:51:00,220
personal information and you can choose

1165
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:02,320
what to share with each application

1166
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:04,959
provider for example if you want to

1167
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:07,150
participate in a certain application you

1168
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,250
can choose to do that if you don't the

1169
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:11,109
application would not get your data it's

1170
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:12,880
it's very simple if you look at it and

1171
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:14,950
our federated in a federal in a way if

1172
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,500
we look at it and a centralized the ID

1173
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:19,118
we're like Facebook Connect Google

1174
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,130
accounts and things like that and it's

1175
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,560
very hard to implement you could use

1176
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:25,030
OAuth for that but it you know it would

1177
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:27,369
still require a lot of technical

1178
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:28,000
implementation so what with what we've

1179
00:51:27,369 --> 00:51:30,820
built

1180
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,780
you actually have an identity provider

1181
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:37,660
that requests access to application

1182
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:40,210
services not the other way around and

1183
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:43,149
application service can offer you look

1184
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:44,590
we have a you know marketplace for jobs

1185
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:47,200
you want to get high and you're like

1186
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:49,990
yeah and you send them the data that you

1187
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,640
choose to send it's something that

1188
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:53,470
Facebook wanted to do but never really

1189
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:56,529
implement it properly but you know they

1190
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:58,629
have look what you're sharing thing it's

1191
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:00,820
it's very similar to the law so I think

1192
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:02,980
that that provides a good separation and

1193
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:05,109
it kind of alleviate that concern of

1194
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:07,540
like privacy issues ideally that

1195
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:10,630
identity would be something that's

1196
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:13,150
separate from school right now we don't

1197
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:15,099
have that but hopefully we would be able

1198
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:17,109
to separate the identity

1199
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:19,539
service outside of a school a singular

1200
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:20,589
school and allow one identity service to

1201
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:23,499
be used throughout the schools

1202
00:52:20,589 --> 00:52:25,450
everywhere right because you would be

1203
00:52:23,499 --> 00:52:27,669
then able to control your data outside a

1204
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:29,319
specific school and not having a problem

1205
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:31,960
of do you trust your school with your

1206
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:35,700
data and it's very similar to do you

1207
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,700
trust Facebook with your data right

1208
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:52,120
[Music]

1209
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:57,830
some issues in education is very

1210
00:52:52,120 --> 00:53:00,440
specialized people each day then then go

1211
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:02,799
all away and for 15 years and just

1212
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,800
because

1213
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:09,200
so I mean of course that's a problem the

1214
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:17,810
truth solve itself you know we have

1215
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:26,759
enough pre-knowledge inky pinky in

1216
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:29,240
August for the problem

1217
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,240
operations

1218
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:37,180
so the way I approach that right now is

1219
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,470
that throughout the the only problem

1220
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:41,020
that we now run

1221
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:44,319
it's an offline program in a small town

1222
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:47,740
you know very difficult to run you can

1223
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:49,900
see how people's motivations differ from

1224
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:51,850
person person right and then another

1225
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:55,000
thing is I wouldn't separate the world

1226
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:57,190
to capitalist or communist or I mean

1227
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,690
there's you know there are capitalist

1228
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:02,770
countries there are more socialist than

1229
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:07,540
China is I want to separate this - are

1230
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:09,970
we running toward a market-based economy

1231
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:11,680
are we running toward you know planned

1232
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:15,009
production economy which no-one is going

1233
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:17,890
toward right now or the third option is

1234
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:21,310
do we want a peer based Commons based

1235
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:23,319
economy right free software is a good

1236
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:28,060
example of Commons peer based production

1237
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:30,490
right a comments based market you

1238
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:32,190
provide value because it's you know it's

1239
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:35,020
significant to you to provide it right

1240
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:37,060
and then in that landscape of like I

1241
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:39,160
have fee knowledge and I can do what I

1242
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:41,890
want because I'm as a human the center

1243
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:44,259
of Education if my motivation is to get

1244
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:46,480
hired in Google I'm going to strive

1245
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:48,730
toward that right and the problem is not

1246
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:51,400
going to say you have to do one of these

1247
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:54,040
things but if I'm a hacker who just

1248
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,450
wants to take you know rust and hack

1249
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,580
away on something that's going to be

1250
00:54:55,450 --> 00:55:00,879
open source and on money for it I don't

1251
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:02,710
want my school or other people's schools

1252
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,930
to actually you know prevent people from

1253
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:08,680
doing that so in essence that's the

1254
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:11,799
point of an chapo genic education is

1255
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:13,660
that you as a person can decide what you

1256
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,820
want to do and the corporation does not

1257
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:20,040
have the power to actually limit the

1258
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:22,270
school to one way for you or the other

1259
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,910
so I think that by providing free

1260
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:27,130
knowledge you would be able to you know

1261
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:29,950
just do whatever you want

1262
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:30,970
depending on what the thing is if you

1263
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:32,799
want to get hired if you want to

1264
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:34,209
participate in a market economy and you

1265
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,210
want to go work for Google or other

1266
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:39,810
company you can do that if not you can

1267
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:43,380
do another thing if the school is not

1268
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:43,380
opinionated in any way

1269
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:51,310
any question well thank you very much

1270
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,310
again

1271
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,770
you
