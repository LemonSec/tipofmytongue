1
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:30,150
I think I think we're ready guys all

2
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:34,080
right I think we're all ready to start

3
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:37,620
this talk yes I'm not sighs but I am

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,730
here to introduce him he comes all the

5
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:45,589
way from a distant land called America

6
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:48,540
he lived in a small shoe of a house and

7
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,699
like I mean look at the guy there's

8
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,940
there's a lot I can say about him he

9
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:56,610
comes often here the ball come from what

10
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,680
I hear from him he's talking about it's

11
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,610
coming earlier and the pie you should

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,530
ask him about the pie he's got a really

13
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,179
interesting talk today though let's all

14
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,620
give him a round of applause

15
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,210
cos øz most of that applause should

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:18,000
should go to will here for that fabulous

17
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,889
intro best intro ever so this talk is

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,830
about

19
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:26,280
OPSEC with mobile devices in super high

20
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,658
threat environments and so by mobile I

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,909
mean I'm going to concentrate on mobile

22
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,750
phones and in particular as you see here

23
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:36,359
burner phones how to use them properly

24
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:38,539
so there's basically you know a couple

25
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,669
of different kinds of hacking talks

26
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:45,090
there's the really deep dive how does a

27
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,590
thing work inside type of talk this is

28
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,909
the ones where you break a system so

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,189
that you can tell everyone about the

30
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,829
problems and help out the hackers or

31
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,119
help to improve security in general and

32
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:57,570
there's the type that's about how to

33
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,600
commit crimes and that's what this talk

34
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,339
is gonna be about but I don't want

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,109
people to go out leading your leap here

36
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,299
and say oh yes I was told us encouraged

37
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:08,940
us all to commit crimes at balkon so

38
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,400
i'll asterisk that crimes in the public

39
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,710
interest so there sometimes we have to

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,650
break the law as a moral imperative like

41
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,150
resisting a repressive system so you

42
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,290
know not all laws the good laws so

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,560
that's that's the kind of laws I'm

44
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,190
talking about type of crimes

45
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,840
OPSEC stands for operational security

46
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,440
basically means preventing leakage of

47
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,909
information that could lead to your

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,050
discovery or your disadvantage when

49
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:37,420
you're on some sort of a team

50
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,970
and so this is a propaganda image from

51
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,299
world war two sums it up but of course

52
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,310
in war we know who our enemies are we

53
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,440
don't have such obvious enemies anymore

54
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,930
it depends who we are and what we're up

55
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,640
to but so it might be a repressive

56
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,350
government might be the police might be

57
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,299
a rival corporation that's engaged in

58
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:59,440
industrial espionage it doesn't matter

59
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,360
OPSEC is asking can an adversary exploit

60
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,950
or interpret information about what

61
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,470
you're doing that can be useful to them

62
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,660
and then preventing that exploitation so

63
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,980
you have to do a red team approach you

64
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,260
have to second-guess what you're up to

65
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,910
from an attack is perspective and

66
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,950
especially if what you're up to what

67
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,900
your activities are put your life at

68
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,030
risk or your freedom at risk then you

69
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,230
really have to take this seriously so

70
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,780
you have to do whatever you need to do

71
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,670
to motivate yourself so once again is

72
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,290
talk maximum fed environments we're

73
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,720
talking about environments populated by

74
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,510
highly resourced adversaries such as

75
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,430
state-level observers here's another

76
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,340
more recent piece of government

77
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:40,180
propaganda your tax dollars at work if

78
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,650
you're in the United States but it's

79
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,510
pretty straightforward what they're

80
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,120
trying to tell you here you have to look

81
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,410
at what information is relevant look at

82
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,040
your likely threats and potential

83
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,090
vulnerabilities and then assess those

84
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,489
risks and take appropriate

85
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,500
countermeasures so

86
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,150
OPSEC this is very important doesn't

87
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,760
start and end with the actual operation

88
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,770
that you're doing it needs to cover all

89
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,929
of your initial exploration and all of

90
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,310
your preparation for in hacking

91
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,570
especially you know we do it we try a

92
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,459
lot of things that don't work the first

93
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,950
time all of those things need to be

94
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:14,560
covered by OPSEC as well or else you can

95
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,048
get busted and it also extends to what

96
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,418
you do after the operation you can do

97
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,260
slip-ups after you're after things being

98
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:22,270
taken care of and maybe it doesn't

99
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,440
matter you know maybe your sacrificial

100
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,669
at that point but it's always nice to

101
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,620
stay out of prison so you know you want

102
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:31,000
to take the mindset that you kind of you

103
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,500
know pretend that you don't know what

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,169
you're doing beforehand and afterwards

105
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,740
you just forget that you did it so it's

106
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:40,299
a 24/7 job so here's a few assumptions

107
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,360
going into what I'll talk about today

108
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,850
first of all the mobile phone network is

109
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,540
an amazing machine that humans have

110
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,740
built and it's just very very convenient

111
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,560
so we're going to assume that it's too

112
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:56,100
convenient not to use entirely it's fast

113
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,330
easy to access very widespread so let's

114
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,820
try and figure out a way to use it as

115
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:03,479
safety safely as possible we're also

116
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:06,630
going to assume that our conspiracy I

117
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,580
mean our team is in comprised of

118
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,650
multiple agents right if it's just a

119
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,820
lone wolf then we don't need really to

120
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,500
use phone opponents we'd have to do a

121
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,190
lot of communication so we're going to

122
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,690
talk about teamwork and we're gonna use

123
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,980
the mobile phone network in all stages

124
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:25,830
of the operation planning and execution

125
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:29,070
if the if the operation has been

126
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:31,580
pre-planned offline then just the

127
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,349
execution phase is pretty easy to do

128
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,180
relatively speaking with burner phones

129
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,710
so it's the stuff that happens

130
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,680
beforehand that often gets people busted

131
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,450
so here's our goals for our mobile app

132
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,700
stack plan we want to communicate with

133
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,380
our associates and we want to also be at

134
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:50,400
a coordinate and execute the operation

135
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,020
in real time and while we're doing that

136
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,570
we want to protect the identities of

137
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,400
everyone involved the locations

138
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:59,430
especially the ones that are home base

139
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,099
specially ones we reside in the size and

140
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:05,460
the structure of our organization and

141
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:08,220
then the details of the plan and ideally

142
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,219
the existence of a plan at all so things

143
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,660
like the wot the win and the we're here

144
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,700
are the constraints that we're operating

145
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,590
under with the mobile network we're

146
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:21,750
going to do this using devices that

147
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:24,570
constantly facilitate the interception

148
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,190
of the content and the metadata they

149
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:28,380
disclose their location all the time

150
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,270
without our ability to easily obscure

151
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,420
that in a way that we can with the

152
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,370
internet with IP packets our devices may

153
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,160
host numerous tracking bugs that were

154
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,260
not aware of and these are just the bare

155
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,970
minimum vulnerabilities it actually gets

156
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:45,150
much much worse depending on what kind

157
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:47,460
of devices we're talking about so this

158
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,280
is a quick rundown of how much worse it

159
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,349
can get I present to you the smartphone

160
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,229
which is the most fiendish tracking

161
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:58,250
device ever developed by humans it

162
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:01,390
produces stores and therefore can leak

163
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,950
of course the metadata of all calls and

164
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,090
straight to the phone companies and

165
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,650
therefore straight to the federal

166
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,219
agencies that are in bed with the phone

167
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:10,870
companies the location information to

168
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,610
anyone who can make legal requests of

169
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:16,030
the phone company which include which

170
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,710
don't need calls to be made and they

171
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,440
also can come from various apps that

172
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,530
track location from data metadata that

173
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,350
gets attached to photographs for example

174
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:30,130
contact lists all the networks that

175
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:33,060
we've ever accessed unique identifies of

176
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:36,640
the device and the SIM card and so on

177
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,720
all kinds of sensor data which there's

178
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,280
some really interesting attacks out

179
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,720
there I won't get into here but there's

180
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,429
some great great attacks that can

181
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,200
extract things from all the

182
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:47,220
accelerometer and gyroscope data for

183
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:50,469
example and the Thea modern smartphones

184
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,850
or cookies intelligence agencies love

185
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,530
these they can get grab those and then

186
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,620
they can maintain persistence persistent

187
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,580
access to your email accounts and so on

188
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,900
the kind of things you've been searching

189
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:04,840
for there's no guarantee of strong

190
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:07,690
cryptography on a per app basis on

191
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:11,609
smartphone apps if people screw this up

192
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:14,620
all the time developers that is when

193
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,330
these are memory constrained devices so

194
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,800
every so often the browser runs out of

195
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,330
memory and it reloads all your open tabs

196
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,010
and so that means even if you've

197
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,479
accessed something in a secure location

198
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:25,780
suddenly you can be leaking that

199
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,760
information to auto connecting it's in

200
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,559
trying to connect to a network so anyone

201
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,420
who's got Wi-Fi pineapples is played

202
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,830
around with this and identified devices

203
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,229
based on what networks they connect to

204
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,420
apps of course a totally unreliable in

205
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,820
general and all this stuff add up to a

206
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:42,819
unique pattern of life that can be used

207
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:45,900
to identify you and track you regardless

208
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,760
of whether you swap devices frequently

209
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,329
and so one of my favorite places to go

210
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,970
to get OPSEC related information is the

211
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,950
intelligence agencies themselves but the

212
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,920
internal communications of the of those

213
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:02,680
services reveal just how much they like

214
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,130
things like phones so here's some stuff

215
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:10,449
from the Snowden leaks that talk about

216
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:13,330
how great it is when targets use smart

217
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,870
phones so here's a list of all the kinds

218
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,970
of things that

219
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,460
can get from in terms of user activity

220
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,190
all the things I just mentioned and more

221
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,760
and this is this is just an example of

222
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,950
sort of a very simple action that most

223
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,180
uses that youth smartphones do all that

224
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:33,130
all day every day

225
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:34,689
sharing a photograph they that's kind of

226
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,160
a perfect scenario for the intelligence

227
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,440
agencies they get all kinds of metadata

228
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,680
they get all kinds of information that

229
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:45,160
they can use but let's quickly cover

230
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,530
content because that seems so the too

231
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,730
many people who are sort of getting into

232
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,650
security for the first time that that's

233
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,440
what you've really got to protect right

234
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:56,050
that's the biggest vulnerability the

235
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,680
thing is with content that is that it's

236
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:02,079
mostly protected by local laws so

237
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,589
accessing content depending on the

238
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,780
agency isn't always just a completely

239
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,550
straightforward thing so I'll use the

240
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,430
United States as an example because

241
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,979
that's what I know well so in the United

242
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,839
States they foreign in total are in

243
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,660
Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA was

244
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:22,210
made in 1978 but in terms of domestic

245
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,069
surveillance of content the appropriate

246
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:27,870
law is Kalia the communications access

247
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:32,230
for law enforcement acts from 1994

248
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:34,150
so that was allowing domestic

249
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:37,480
wiretapping right for example by the FBI

250
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:39,760
so by 1999 under Kalia we got two and a

251
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:43,870
half million calls being content

252
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,060
recorded so you know that's that's a lot

253
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,200
of calls by some metrics but in terms of

254
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,939
the number of calls that are getting

255
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,280
made that's very very small there aren't

256
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:55,690
that many content based wiretaps in the

257
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:57,160
United States a lot of these come

258
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,190
through the phone companies another way

259
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,689
that the police can do short-range

260
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,450
collection is with a device called an

261
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,310
EMC catcher it's often known by its one

262
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:08,410
particular ones brand name a stingray

263
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:12,099
and it's what is that is that is a cell

264
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:14,170
site simulator so it tricks any phone in

265
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,470
range it's a short-range device into

266
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:19,810
connecting through to this fake cell

267
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,460
tower instead of the real cell tower so

268
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,380
obviously you can do a man-in-the-middle

269
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,660
attack with this device that's why

270
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,499
primarily what it's used for often also

271
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,718
in conjunction

272
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:32,949
with a downgrade attack so it can trick

273
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:34,719
the phone into using a an earlier method

274
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:36,878
of communication with weaker encryption

275
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:40,929
for example to make the to make that

276
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:43,899
content capture attack easier however in

277
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:47,499
many cases the uses of these devices

278
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:50,889
have come under scrutiny and the police

279
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:52,539
in a lot of cases prefer not to capture

280
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:54,489
content because to capturing content

281
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:55,919
requires a warrant and in many cases

282
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:58,359
they can get everything that they need

283
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,239
without a warrant by not capturing

284
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:02,349
content by just capturing metadata

285
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:04,389
that's in the case of the police so

286
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:05,859
local law enforcement is usually subject

287
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:07,959
to slightly more restrictions although

288
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:10,059
in many cases they do not disclose when

289
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:12,909
they use the situations in which they

290
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:14,228
use stingray tape devices but the

291
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:16,329
intelligence agencies are in a much

292
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:17,409
better situated position that you can

293
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:18,549
usually just go straight to the phone

294
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:20,889
companies they have all kinds of

295
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:23,679
agreements in place and they can also go

296
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:25,239
to each other so intelligent national

297
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,449
intelligence agencies often have cotton

298
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:31,209
ships so for example the NSA can just

299
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:32,889
say 2g CH 2 in the UK and say hey we're

300
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:35,799
not allowed to domestically surveil this

301
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:37,019
person but you are can you capture their

302
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,459
stuff and then just give it to us

303
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:41,709
totally legal that happens all the time

304
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,998
us-israel partnership as well they just

305
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:44,439
swap data like that so they have all

306
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:50,199
these end runs around content

307
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:52,449
legislation so because if you're at a

308
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:54,758
level at which you know foreign

309
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:56,049
intelligence is important like let's say

310
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:58,839
you work for a defense contractor

311
00:12:56,049 --> 00:13:00,549
they'll often say you are not allowed to

312
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,739
discuss any aspect of this project on a

313
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:04,299
phone under any circumstances if you

314
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:06,249
want to talk about this project you have

315
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:07,779
to come to the skiff the service this

316
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:11,099
sensitive compartmented information

317
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:13,599
facility that we have in our

318
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:15,519
headquarters and you'll discuss it there

319
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:17,049
with partners and so on it's because

320
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,609
they know that content is a

321
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:20,348
vulnerability when you're talking about

322
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:21,819
espionage right when you're talking

323
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:24,759
about stuff that's not constrained by

324
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:26,919
local laws but in many cases if you're

325
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:29,709
if you're just a regular criminal that's

326
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:33,029
your you are going to force the police

327
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:35,649
to get warrants and so on to get content

328
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:36,740
now the other big problem with content

329
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:39,980
is that

330
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,170
endpoint security is really bad so even

331
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,450
if Wyatt apps can't be done by whoever

332
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,279
your adversary is if they can get hold

333
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,589
of your actual device the content that's

334
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:50,450
at rest on that device is often a huge

335
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:52,880
vulnerability but it's an avoidable

336
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:54,950
vulnerability right you can choose

337
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,810
whether or not in many cases to store

338
00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:00,080
content at rest on your device so that's

339
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,750
number one

340
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:08,089
OPSEC role with mobile devices don't

341
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:11,089
store content hear some more about

342
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:12,529
endpoint security on smartphones you

343
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:14,870
know it's just basically a total black

344
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:17,810
box you can't really know how secure

345
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,550
your endpoint is because there's all

346
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:21,140
kinds of O'Day's out there that you

347
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,670
don't know about the operating system

348
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,800
vendor doesn't know about if they don't

349
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,390
know about it you can't know about it so

350
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,359
you know recently in the news I'm sure

351
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:30,890
everyone saw this that you know iOS has

352
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,420
a reputation for good security the

353
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,970
iPhones R it's supposed to be a

354
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,329
reasonably secure device but just

355
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,350
announced like by Google project zero

356
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,310
you know a couple of weeks ago that

357
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:46,370
China had at least two years of

358
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:49,430
persistent access to the latest version

359
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:52,579
at the time of iOS and iPhone great and

360
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:55,699
they were indiscriminately using this to

361
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:57,859
hack and install malware in a watering

362
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:01,279
hole attack on certain websites so these

363
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,440
were browser o days with in sandbox

364
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,270
escapes that you just visited that

365
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,610
website it was that it silently

366
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:12,860
installed an implant on your phone and

367
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:16,339
two years on fully patched most recent

368
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:18,800
devices and so this was used we think

369
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:21,110
against the Weger minority so these were

370
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,359
installed on websites that the Chinese

371
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,380
government thought that that the week of

372
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,810
minority people were going to be

373
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:30,740
visiting and anyone who visited them got

374
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:32,569
owned now when I say you can't know this

375
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,399
particular implant I really recommend

376
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,770
reading project zeros deep dive into

377
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,510
this but this particular implant the

378
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,970
O'Day's that allowed the implant

379
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,860
installation were clever but the implant

380
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,510
itself was completely amateurish it

381
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,350
exfiltrated everything from the device

382
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,360
in clear-text

383
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,430
so if you were doing any kind of

384
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,900
you know if you were in a corporate

385
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,920
environment and you haven't had an IDs

386
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,300
on there that was checking for

387
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,469
exfiltration this would have shown that

388
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,760
this would have shown up dramatically

389
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,450
right they didn't make any effort to

390
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,490
make the implant stealthy really but

391
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,740
what if they did if the implant was

392
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,050
stealthy you would never know it so

393
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,390
here's what the implant exfiltrated once

394
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,099
it got a foothold remember I was talking

395
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,720
about content at rest and that being a

396
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,060
liability that's exactly what I was

397
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,280
exfiltrating so here's some stuff from

398
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,199
project zero although all the stolid

399
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,630
watsapp conversations and let's remember

400
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,010
that whatsapp uses signal encryption

401
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,480
right so that doesn't save you here

402
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,689
because the implant gets everything in

403
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:29,540
clear text telegram as well same thing

404
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,700
all the conversations hold a full

405
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:34,310
database file for iMessage it's apples

406
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:37,400
proprietary unaudited encrypted

407
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:40,280
messaging system who even uses Google

408
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:44,180
Hangouts anymore I don't know but the

409
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:46,100
implant X will traded it just in case

410
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,790
lots more data to grab on smart phones

411
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:52,460
all the stored email the contact list of

412
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:56,689
course I mentioned GPS location history

413
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:58,850
and the keychain so any passwords that

414
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,980
were stored on device also given up also

415
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:04,160
it's not on the slide but the OAuth

416
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,050
cookies so this implant allowed the

417
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,850
agencies to have persistent email access

418
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,909
the implant didn't survive a reboot of

419
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:12,889
the phone but the quickly oh the auth

420
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:16,420
cookies were already exfiltrated so they

421
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:18,829
could still get into people's email so

422
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,810
once again the implant could have been

423
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:23,000
detected but you can't count on this and

424
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,669
anyway even let's say you knew it's too

425
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,610
late all of that stuff is already in the

426
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,180
hands of the attacker so moving on to

427
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,820
metadata

428
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,770
that means all the data metadata is data

429
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:37,090
so all the data the phone generates that

430
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:38,170
is not conversational content so

431
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,580
[Music]

432
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,870
everything is tagged everything you do

433
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:46,070
on the phone is tagged with the endpoint

434
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:47,419
ID identifies so that the IMEI the MC

435
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,800
the phone number all that kind of stuff

436
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:53,210
so all the calls and messages that get

437
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,950
sent all the temporal data so what time

438
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,300
did you make a call how long did the

439
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,590
call go for look really really

440
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,070
interesting things can be extracted from

441
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:02,689
that and I

442
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:04,790
go into that more later locations so the

443
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:08,240
cell tower that's being used or IP

444
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:11,690
address of messages being sent over over

445
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,110
Wi-Fi the device type got some

446
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:18,200
interesting stuff on that later too

447
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:20,090
etc etc but again this stuff is covered

448
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:24,500
by local laws so here's the situation in

449
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:26,840
the u.s. there are things that the

450
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,940
police can apply for in order to capture

451
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,919
and catch this so this is again police

452
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,860
not intelligence agencies but the the US

453
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,180
the police can request from a judge I

454
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,050
don't think they generally need a

455
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,780
warrant for this because it's just

456
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,730
metadata but the two archaic things that

457
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,460
date back to the plain old telephone

458
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:45,290
system prime number one it's called a

459
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,700
pen register so that gives them all

460
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,139
numbers that were dialed from a

461
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,400
particular phone so they've got a target

462
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,380
phone they say I want to know everyone

463
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,150
who called this and then the other is

464
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,550
called a trap-and-trace that gives you

465
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,560
the other way round that gives you the

466
00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:02,950
all the the identifying information of

467
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:05,929
all the phones that call that number but

468
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,520
once we have all that information we may

469
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,630
not care about the content if we're the

470
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,070
police that may tell us exactly

471
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:13,250
everything we need to know about what

472
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:15,320
that phone is being used for the

473
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,420
intelligence agencies of course a law

474
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,280
unto themselves they have essentially

475
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:22,340
unlimited ability to capture all of that

476
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:26,629
metadata and store it forever to mine

477
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:28,970
whenever they feel like it and the bad

478
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,800
news for us is that although we can

479
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:34,120
minimize content it will give minimize

480
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:37,430
what we transmit we cannot avoid

481
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:39,649
producing metadata and it's not

482
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:41,540
something that we can store you know we

483
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,590
can delete on the endpoint that's stuff

484
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:46,250
that's out there and there's nothing

485
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:47,360
really we can do about that and so of

486
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,000
course intelligence agencies the

487
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,810
supergun Kofa for bulk phone metadata

488
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,310
collection so here's another slide set

489
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,350
of slides from the Snowden leaks showing

490
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,179
all of the different types of metadata

491
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,610
that they can capture and how excited

492
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,920
they are about that of course very

493
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,899
famous quote that you've probably heard

494
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,900
Mike Hayden who was director of the NSA

495
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,610
and the CIA we kill people based on

496
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,630
metadata that's how important metadata

497
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,240
is I

498
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:16,910
here's an example of exactly that this

499
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,780
is when they when they kill someone with

500
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:22,610
a drone they produce a little slide deck

501
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:26,990
explaining it as part of the internal

502
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:30,500
review process so here is a slide of a

503
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:32,450
particular drone assassination that was

504
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,960
performed and what I want you to focus

505
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:37,670
on here is that it's not really a person

506
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,880
that's being targeted in these drone

507
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:42,110
strikes it's a phone so here on the

508
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,250
right it's a little blurry on this

509
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:49,219
screen but the red stuff is phone SIGINT

510
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:51,380
and the blue stuff on this graph there

511
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,940
that's where they actually could see the

512
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,710
person from the drone that's where they

513
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,730
could see with the camera and identify

514
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,200
that that was the person they want to

515
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:00,040
shoot there's not much blue on that

516
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,240
graph it's almost all tracking a phone

517
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,379
sending a missile to blow up phone and

518
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,710
whoever's holding it they just assume

519
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:11,180
that the person holding it is the owner

520
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:13,430
identify phone track at vomit location

521
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,350
gets extracted by various methods

522
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,180
location metadata so of course we're

523
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,709
pinning a tower the phone company knows

524
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,330
what tau is being pinged it knows where

525
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,210
it's located and it retains that

526
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:24,949
information for a long time and that's

527
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:28,070
accessible to anyone who has a

528
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,240
partnership with the company in conflict

529
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:33,110
zones where they're actually drowning

530
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:35,120
people they also use various RF

531
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,740
direction-finding tools so they'll they

532
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,600
can track phones that are turned on even

533
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:41,840
if they're and if they're broadcasting

534
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,120
even if there's no tower in range but

535
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,449
not everywhere obviously is saturated

536
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:50,419
with this type of capability then of

537
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:52,340
course we know that when we look for our

538
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,260
in location with a smart phone it uses

539
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:59,120
the Wi-Fi neighborhood first to find the

540
00:21:54,260 --> 00:22:01,790
location and then GPS is used as a high

541
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,899
resolution next thing it's the GPS takes

542
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,930
power so that uses the Wi-Fi

543
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:08,090
neighborhood first so again it's

544
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:10,010
impossible to avoid producing some sort

545
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:14,720
of location information when the phone

546
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:17,300
is active so here's an example from when

547
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,550
a journalist in Australia decided to

548
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,080
voluntarily give up a year of his own

549
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:24,000
phone metadata just to see what could be

550
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:27,510
extracted so here's the location

551
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,690
metadata so it's pretty obvious where

552
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:32,550
this guy lives and works and he's

553
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:35,010
commuting every day between those two

554
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:38,820
locations suggest from the test from the

555
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:41,040
tower ping information and then from the

556
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,110
contact information we can see who you

557
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,370
know who he talks to and when so we can

558
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:50,280
infer some things about you know who

559
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:52,080
he's dating who he who he works for that

560
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,730
kind of stuff so we get a very accurate

561
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,990
pattern of life just from this phone

562
00:22:53,730 --> 00:23:00,330
metadata which I call that an attack

563
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:03,000
surface of life right it's not just a

564
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,409
pattern and that's just from a few

565
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,560
pieces of metadata that's being

566
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:10,620
collected over the year so fun fun times

567
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:13,830
this his time for our fun case study

568
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:16,979
number one this is going to be the CIA

569
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:19,770
who obviously these are these guys are

570
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,630
experts of this stuff right like OPSEC

571
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,850
it's the middle name of the CIA they

572
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,890
never anything up at the CIA that's

573
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:31,459
why their history is called legacy of

574
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:34,170
ashes so in this case the CIA CIA team

575
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,420
illegally abducted an Egyptian cleric

576
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:39,660
named Abu Omar off the street in Italy

577
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:43,020
they grabbed him took him to Egypt to be

578
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:45,390
tortured okay this guy disappeared how

579
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,970
do we know the CIA did it of course from

580
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:52,230
the phones well there's the picture of

581
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:54,210
the guy so they get this guy he's on the

582
00:23:52,230 --> 00:24:00,690
street in Italy they throw him in the

583
00:23:54,210 --> 00:24:03,810
CIA van in 2003 February in April 2004

584
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:06,420
the Italian prosecutors started looking

585
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:09,240
into this guy's disappearance they found

586
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,740
out that he was he you know showed up in

587
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,720
Egypt he was released from detention in

588
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:18,630
Egypt they're like okay how did he get

589
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:20,610
there in early 2005 they reconstructed a

590
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:23,490
very detailed patent of this abduction

591
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:25,919
from the phone records and then in July

592
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:31,920
2006 they filed charges in Italy against

593
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:35,040
31 CIA assets including 26 Americans and

594
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:37,059
that led to the director of the CIA at

595
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,090
that time for the gas to be like Oh

596
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:42,928
yet how did you guys get on so badly we

597
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:45,789
need a top-down review of our tradecraft

598
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:48,999
because this was bad so let's take a

599
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:52,259
look at what happened mostly this was

600
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:54,340
done by metadata mining they went to the

601
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:57,249
phone companies and said we want all

602
00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:00,129
this historical phone records from from

603
00:24:57,249 --> 00:25:01,659
the area and they primarily used the

604
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:03,459
location information so they looked at

605
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:05,320
phones that were in the same place and

606
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:10,570
that moved to the same place together

607
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:14,279
so his Italy with the location of an

608
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:18,369
American Air Base and they found 17

609
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:21,369
phones in Milan on the street where the

610
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:23,259
guy was abducted and then also nearby in

611
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:25,320
c'mon so there were two separate teams

612
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:29,379
that were responsible from this the

613
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:32,460
Milan team phones moved to Camano and

614
00:25:29,379 --> 00:25:35,199
linked up with T number two and then

615
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,240
those phones were used to call phones at

616
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,210
Aviano air base and then they moved

617
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,830
there so alright that's interesting and

618
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:44,200
then they looked at some flight records

619
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:47,559
to show that they flew to Ramstein in

620
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:49,509
Germany then they flew to Egypt and then

621
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:51,610
oh look what else showed up in Egypt the

622
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:56,139
phone of the CIA chief of base from

623
00:25:51,610 --> 00:26:00,459
Milan connected to cell towers in Egypt

624
00:25:56,139 --> 00:26:02,918
made calls back to Milan and then the

625
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:06,220
phone went back to Italy one month

626
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:07,539
afterwards okay all right that's like

627
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,490
pretty compelling circumstantial

628
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:11,860
evidence that the Americans were

629
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:15,970
involved well what happened next well

630
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:17,949
those phones were also located at luxury

631
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:20,200
hotels in Milan five hundred bucks a

632
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:24,610
night that's uh that's fancy your tax

633
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:27,009
dollars at work those hotel rooms were

634
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:30,008
paid with credit cards with names on

635
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:32,139
them and they host all state hotel stays

636
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:34,389
were connected to frequent flyer

637
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:36,639
membership details to get those points

638
00:26:34,389 --> 00:26:39,998
right there we'll also under real names

639
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:44,258
so these allowed the real identities of

640
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:48,610
the abductors to be discovered so end of

641
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:50,320
this case study the outcome epic fail on

642
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:53,020
the part of the CIA

643
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,149
twenty-five agents and one F force was

644
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:58,379
gonna colonel where were indicted and

645
00:26:55,150 --> 00:27:00,660
convicted in absentia in courts in Italy

646
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,530
the CIA base chief got eight years

647
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,120
prison of course they weren't there to

648
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:06,280
serve that prison time but if they go to

649
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,860
Europe they could be they could be

650
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:11,490
imprisoned the Rome Rome station chief

651
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,990
got seven years and the others got five

652
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:16,510
also two Italian secret agents were

653
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:18,670
convicted not in absentia the director

654
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,110
of seize me which was the relevant

655
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,910
intelligence agency that was providing

656
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,639
support in Italy got a 10-year prison

657
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,800
sentence in the deputy director got nine

658
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,450
and everyone pretty much got flapped

659
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,570
with one and a half million euro fines

660
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:34,660
so serious consequences for this

661
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:36,189
abduction and torture scenario so let's

662
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,080
take a quick look at what them is what

663
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:40,960
you know a summary of the mistakes that

664
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:45,159
were made they use the single set of

665
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,230
funds sewn on burner type they use them

666
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,000
continuously over the nine day operation

667
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,920
never took out the batteries so they

668
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,110
have a perfect minute-by-minute history

669
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:58,450
of all of the movement of those phones

670
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,229
they should have destroyed every phone

671
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,630
that they used in the operation

672
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:03,700
immediately before they could give up

673
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,770
any location history of what happened

674
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,570
next even even if it could even if those

675
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,040
phones could have been identified they

676
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:11,740
should not have been kept around to

677
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,300
provide further evidence obviously they

678
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,100
should never have been localized at

679
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,629
places that were important prior to the

680
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:20,340
operation those phones should just have

681
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:22,570
been used before the abduction operation

682
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,340
they certainly should never have been

683
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,750
used to contact known assets that could

684
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,250
be connected back to them so they were

685
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,390
use to call us consulate that we used to

686
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,190
call the airbase that used to calls

687
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:32,350
called the QI at CIA chief of base and

688
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,990
also Langley Virginia what's in Langley

689
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:39,550
Virginia the headquarters of the CIA and

690
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:41,410
of course friends and family and what is

691
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:44,770
the CIA chief of base doing traveling

692
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:46,630
with an own phone like being being

693
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:49,320
tracked around the world based on his

694
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:51,490
phone that seems to be a basic mistake

695
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,810
all right so moving on from that case

696
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:56,890
study one thing that's mentioned there

697
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,350
is like hey they didn't take the

698
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,610
batteries out you know well some people

699
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,770
might say that seems like a paranoid

700
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,570
thing to do is it really necessary to

701
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:07,149
take the batter

702
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:08,740
yes it is because inside every phone is

703
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:11,770
a baseband processor chip that is a

704
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:15,190
complete black box that manages all of

705
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:18,250
the radio functions of the phone and you

706
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:22,059
cannot know what that is doing in

707
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:24,520
there it's got its own memory it's got

708
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:26,500
its own proprietary firmware running on

709
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,049
a proprietary real-time operating system

710
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:32,590
which has never been independently code

711
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:36,370
audited you just can't know what it's

712
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:37,720
doing but okay you may say well I'm sure

713
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:39,100
it's doing I'm sure it's okay I'm sure

714
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,510
that they really put a lot of effort

715
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,740
into the security of this device that

716
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,539
they make sure there's nothing wrong

717
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,460
with it well that that would be of

718
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:47,260
comforting but false thought because in

719
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,320
2014 the people working on replicant

720
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:53,169
which is a Libre version of Android did

721
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,520
found find a backdoor in the baseband

722
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:57,490
processor that's used in the Samsung

723
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:00,129
Galaxy it allowed full read/write access

724
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,870
to use the data on the application side

725
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,929
so this process it could get out and get

726
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:06,459
other data on the smartphone and then

727
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:10,960
modify it or read it and transmit it

728
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:13,360
without you having any idea 2017 Wineman

729
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,330
found memory corruption vulnerability

730
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,189
and in a baseband processor that Huawei

731
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:19,510
uses with an over-the-air memory

732
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,370
corruption vulnerability so people could

733
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:24,429
just transmit things to you and on the

734
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:26,979
phone and then in 2013 counts the null

735
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:28,659
did sim routing because there's a little

736
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,590
processor on the sim 2 that can

737
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:32,140
communicate with the baseband processor

738
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,189
and then just yesterday I think mr.

739
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,710
gadget for bringing this to my attention

740
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:40,029
half an hour before this presentation a

741
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:41,950
group found a malware deployment

742
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:42,940
vulnerability that tenant that they're

743
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,809
calling sim jaca

744
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:49,600
so they can use an act and old on sim

745
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:51,970
browser they can send it a binary SMS

746
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,189
and then command it to exfiltrate

747
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,899
various data including location data so

748
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,100
I'm looking forward to the full report

749
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:58,360
on this being released it hasn't been

750
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,658
released yet but they've announced it

751
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:04,779
and not every as not every sim is

752
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:06,220
vulnerable but you just kind of know

753
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:09,820
what's going on in there

754
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:11,380
and you can have this thing return an

755
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,668
SMS message with location information

756
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,960
all kinds of other things and it's

757
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:16,680
completely transparent to the user the

758
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:19,860
user will never see this

759
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,530
so the fact that this process that

760
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,320
controls the antenna means that it can

761
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:27,330
expose you just by turning something on

762
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,210
even if it's not evil trading any data

763
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,980
if you know some Intelligence Agency is

764
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:34,140
it has an exploit for this and they just

765
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,810
want to fire a missile at you they can

766
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,160
put on a signal and turn it on no matter

767
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:42,960
what that you think that the phone is

768
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:46,220
doing so there's an interesting project

769
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:50,070
that was done a little while ago

770
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:53,790
on whether you could let a user know

771
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:55,830
what the phone is up to because even if

772
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:57,480
you cut you know even if you open your

773
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,639
phone and put a switch in between the

774
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,140
base band and the antenna just the wires

775
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,480
on the circuit board are enough to leak

776
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:07,230
enough RF that people it could actual

777
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,200
trade data over a short range and of

778
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:12,090
course if there's malware on the phone

779
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,490
they can defer payload exfiltration like

780
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:17,790
if you if you think your phone is off

781
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,750
and it's collecting data on you it can

782
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,790
just wait for you to turn it back on

783
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:23,070
again and then it connects with read all

784
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:24,510
that data so you just can't know so if

785
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:26,070
you want to really modify the phone to

786
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:28,740
be able to detect this kind of stuff it

787
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:32,159
requires extreme modifications so in

788
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,000
2016 bunny Wong and it would snowed and

789
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,030
work together

790
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,240
mostly bunny to do this thing they call

791
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:41,070
the introspection engine so this was a

792
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,110
little board that was like a parasitic

793
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:46,560
add-on they did it for a particular

794
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:48,659
model of iPhone so here it is sitting

795
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,520
under the battery of a modified iPhone

796
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:54,480
it's sticking out the side there it is

797
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:57,150
with the screen back on and there's a

798
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,840
breakdown of the way that it's connected

799
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:04,320
and what it does is it measures and

800
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,480
reports to you your cell GPS Wi-Fi and

801
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,060
Bluetooth antenna activity in real time

802
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,010
so it tells you okay you may think your

803
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,270
phone is in airplane mode or Wi-Fi is

804
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:16,790
off whatever but here's what it's

805
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:19,139
actually doing so pretty cool project

806
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:23,460
very nice and that's also worth reading

807
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:25,980
their full report on but you know this

808
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:29,070
as cool as it is it's nothing more than

809
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,270
a proof-of-concept right no one is ever

810
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,919
going to use this as a practical

811
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,840
solution because it's very dependent on

812
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,580
the model you have to have a lot of

813
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,330
hardware hacking experience to even

814
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,919
install it the reality is that we just

815
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:44,820
accept that we cannot trust the hardware

816
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:46,830
at all and so we remove the batteries

817
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,780
and that's a reason another reason why

818
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,310
most smartphones are evil because most

819
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:55,500
of them these days do not have removable

820
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:57,320
batteries okay so back again to metadata

821
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:00,780
analysis and what they use it used to

822
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,700
how they can use it against this once

823
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,320
again we'll use the intelligence

824
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,980
agencies documentation to back this up

825
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,219
so this is from GCHQ in the UK this is

826
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:13,080
all about identifying social networks

827
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:17,009
from mass collected contact data so

828
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,719
again the modus operandi of agencies

829
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,220
that have a privileged network position

830
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,730
is to collect everything and then mine

831
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:28,888
it so here's a few of their contact

832
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:31,168
chaining programs and at least two

833
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:35,100
probably three maybe more of these that

834
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:37,408
are based on telephony so primetime as a

835
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,668
system for doing timing analysis for

836
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,500
looking at what phones are connected to

837
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:44,549
what based on when they do certain

838
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:46,500
things MO AG is they mention it being an

839
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,169
integrated tool a phony data mining we

840
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:52,020
don't actually know what it stands for

841
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:54,480
but my guess is mother of all something

842
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,450
that starts with G because of the

843
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,980
capitalization of mo AG and then sorting

844
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:01,770
friends is one that the NSA developed

845
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:04,320
that they gave to GCHQ and let them use

846
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:06,330
to do basically figuring out like who

847
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,530
the important contacts were and they're

848
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,840
trying to integrate this all into this

849
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:12,960
thing called chat breaker

850
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:14,580
here's the slide on sorting friends so

851
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,620
takes advantage of all the metadata

852
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:20,430
that's available so direct contacts

853
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:21,690
colocation timing and sequencing if you

854
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:24,240
call a number and whether they call back

855
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:25,530
because that's a way to get rid of you

856
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,790
know numbers the wrong numbers and

857
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:30,390
things like that

858
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:32,880
and similar numbers and so on so here's

859
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,790
a quick quick breakdown of how that know

860
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,410
what kind of this thing works so you

861
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:39,750
have this big map this big graph and you

862
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,520
have nodes with your phones and edges

863
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,920
which

864
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:45,320
between phones and so first of all you

865
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,410
score those edges based on what type of

866
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:51,140
contact it is so blue is temporal

867
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:54,230
information a timing pattern black is

868
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:56,990
when a sender contacts the receiver red

869
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,520
is based on the relationship that's been

870
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:01,160
determined between two recipients maybe

871
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:04,070
from other album a today there are other

872
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,600
means and then green is a score of

873
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,830
something called pea-soup which we also

874
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,890
don't know what that stands for that's

875
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:11,600
some sort of algorithm that is part of a

876
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:14,390
document that was not leaked so we don't

877
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,250
know what that is then once you've got

878
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:19,160
these edge scores you score the nodes

879
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:22,100
based on the weights relative to what

880
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,319
you know about the target and of course

881
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:27,140
how you do that weighting anytime you

882
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:31,010
have some kind of weighted network

883
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:32,600
analysis algorithm generating the

884
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,250
weights that's that that's the big

885
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,779
question so we don't know how they do

886
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,430
that and they in their slides they also

887
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:40,369
say like that's something we're still

888
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:42,589
working on but that's that's the basic

889
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:44,690
process but all of this stuff assumes

890
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:48,109
they already know to look for you right

891
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:49,700
you're already a target they're looking

892
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:52,069
at what you're up to but they're also

893
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:55,160
really interested in figuring out likely

894
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:56,930
targets this is kind of what they call

895
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,240
the discovery program and the agencies

896
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:01,040
really sweat over this because if

897
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,970
something happens and they didn't know

898
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,619
anything about it

899
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:06,230
right some guys go and they bomb the

900
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:08,119
London subway or something everyone says

901
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:09,680
to them you why didn't you want

902
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:11,390
us this was gonna happen that's cuz they

903
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,549
they had no idea so they really want to

904
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,779
figure out in advance when there are

905
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,520
networks of people that are up to no

906
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,080
good

907
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,840
from their mass collection data you know

908
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,279
that's the resource they want to use so

909
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,520
target discovery from the social graph

910
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:27,680
so this is this is in particular looking

911
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,290
for burner phone teams right that's this

912
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,149
is the classic adversarial approach to

913
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:37,250
the burner teams so defining them by

914
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:39,440
temporal usage usually used around the

915
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:41,420
same time and also activated and

916
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,060
deactivated at the same time and the

917
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:46,609
network characteristics so closed loops

918
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,750
not calling anyone else and this is the

919
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:50,660
interesting part that I alluded to

920
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:52,430
earlier by the handset type so critical

921
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,399
features here they all start life at the

922
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:55,259
same time

923
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,630
the phones are cheap handsets right

924
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,950
because everyone's got a budget right if

925
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,660
you're gonna use a used burner phones

926
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,160
you might as well go cheap that's the

927
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,040
theory

928
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,690
and then also pointing out here that you

929
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,240
cannot just look for phones that never

930
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,010
call outside the loop because people die

931
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,220
out wrong numbers or they order a pizza

932
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:15,420
or whatever right that they you can't

933
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:18,750
count on the fact that that network is

934
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:21,720
going to be completely self-contained so

935
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:25,040
here's the basic process things that are

936
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,689
important here the time window that's

937
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,980
that's short for various reasons but one

938
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:32,370
of the main reasons is because that

939
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:38,040
screens out the accidental connections

940
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:40,410
to the main network and so like say say

941
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,240
here large enough to allow the giant

942
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:44,009
component so the giant component is the

943
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,080
big blob of normies right there all the

944
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,960
people you don't care about and you just

945
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,970
want to find these small groups but you

946
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,180
don't want to make your window large

947
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:55,529
enough that you you know an accident

948
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:59,250
means that the group goes under the

949
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:03,030
radar so what they test it on here 1.6

950
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:03,840
million phones they got that data most

951
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:13,580
probably straight from the phone

952
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:16,560
companies and then you see here they got

953
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:18,210
four thousand ish phones that weren't in

954
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:23,430
the giant component went in the blob and

955
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:24,810
they were otherwise you know somewhat

956
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:28,890
interesting and that was winnowed down

957
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:30,990
to 17 interesting active loops so out of

958
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:33,210
6 out of 1.6 million phones they've got

959
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:35,640
17 small groups that were with further

960
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:37,260
interest because you know it's it's not

961
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,910
hard to think of closed loops that they

962
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,890
might not be interested in right like so

963
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,420
you've got some elderly relative that's

964
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:44,490
got a phone just to Cole

965
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,600
you know the grandkids or something like

966
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:49,259
that right like they don't care about

967
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:52,370
that so there we go the closed loop the

968
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,370
pen the sign of the pentagram

969
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:57,660
once again the device type you know we

970
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,280
often don't think that that's useful to

971
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,140
anyone but it can be useful because

972
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,130
burners

973
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:06,950
likely to be cheap and you know the

974
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:09,470
these good old Nokia candy bars that's

975
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:11,720
what I used to use at Def Con and the

976
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:13,549
flip phones they're coming back though

977
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,569
they're gonna be like ret retro populist

978
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:19,040
soon the problem with a dumb phone

979
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:21,050
standing out is only gonna get worse

980
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,300
right smartphone penetration at least in

981
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:26,840
wealthy countries is like very anything

982
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,920
very close to 100% so you know you've

983
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,900
got to keep that in mind when you're

984
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,520
planning your operation that the dumb

985
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:35,600
phone is likely to make you stand out

986
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,830
but you can't have to use it but so you

987
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:41,060
should be a little bit diverse about

988
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:42,590
what's fun to use and so you you need

989
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,240
like a fair bit of effort to avoid

990
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:46,460
standing out in a closed loop with your

991
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,049
operation you need them you need to do

992
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:53,240
what I call active OPSEC you need to

993
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:55,880
make a plan and execute that plan so

994
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,589
here's some hits and more stuff that's

995
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,440
not slide documents this is Primak the

996
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:03,170
actual you know documents you can read

997
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,940
which is cool I like those about how

998
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,650
they use metadata to identify targets

999
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:10,310
with little info other than the network

1000
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:11,720
graph mining one takeaway from this this

1001
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:13,160
sort of recapitulates what we just said

1002
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,689
but the the fact that they say the

1003
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,759
interest in closed loops is very

1004
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:18,110
sensitive even though it's kind of an

1005
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,980
obvious thing that you would do they

1006
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:23,810
don't want you to know that they're

1007
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:26,270
doing it and so if you're gonna falsify

1008
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:27,680
your metadata you it's gonna take care

1009
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:29,240
and planning so you've got to think

1010
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,890
about what that graph looks like think

1011
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,390
about the time window right you can't

1012
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,589
just like call a few numbers once and

1013
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:36,259
you're done you have to do it every so

1014
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:38,420
often so think about how an adversary

1015
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,130
could filter out your deliberate noise

1016
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,530
you're you're putting noise in the

1017
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:44,900
signal they want the signal how could

1018
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:47,210
they filter it one particular way is

1019
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,560
when you are using so what you should do

1020
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,210
obviously is with your burner is you

1021
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,529
should call nodes to get your so you

1022
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:53,870
want to be in that big blob you want to

1023
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:56,180
be in the the giant component but you

1024
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:58,009
can't just call what they call pizza

1025
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,529
nodes right so pizza nodes and numbers

1026
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:02,630
that everyone calls because it's like

1027
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,830
the pizza shop you know everyone in the

1028
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,860
neighborhood calls the pizza shop to

1029
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:09,110
order a pizza so when you're falsifying

1030
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,760
your Cole Network you can't use pizza

1031
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,080
nodes because they're already screening

1032
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,130
those out and put as part of the

1033
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,970
closed-loop detection

1034
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:19,280
so what's that yeah cevapi nose that's

1035
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:21,020
that's what they would be in in Serbia

1036
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,370
the chip app you know it's the index and

1037
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:25,810
which notes but you don't call them the

1038
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:28,819
X and which you go there and get one and

1039
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:30,680
then also the temporal information is

1040
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:34,100
really important so a lot of this

1041
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,440
metadata analysis boils down to timing

1042
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,330
right so your closed loops are only if

1043
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,070
your if they're your executors your

1044
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:42,290
operational execution burner phone

1045
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:43,550
network they're only gonna be active for

1046
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:45,710
a short period of time while you do the

1047
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:47,930
op so there's that temporal thing

1048
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:49,820
interesting and funny thing here in the

1049
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:52,879
GCHQ documents they say well we can

1050
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:54,170
identify our own agents because they're

1051
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,450
not allowed to bring their phone into

1052
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:59,090
work so their phones are always dead

1053
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:02,509
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. so they can

1054
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:03,830
identify spies because they've put their

1055
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:06,560
phones are active during the day no one

1056
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:09,650
else's phones are inactive during the

1057
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:12,020
day so that's kind of funny so you got

1058
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:13,850
to pay attention to timing correlation

1059
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,110
you got to pay attention to latency

1060
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:17,210
because they have all this callback

1061
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:18,230
stuff too so if you know if you call a

1062
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:20,810
number and they call you back right

1063
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:22,910
backs straight away that proves to them

1064
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,470
that was a real contact so you know you

1065
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:27,470
can introduce some latency you can

1066
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:30,169
randomize that but to add this noise to

1067
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:31,819
the causal chain of events that could be

1068
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:33,350
being mined but again all of this takes

1069
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,200
a lot of effort you've got to really

1070
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:37,819
think about it so time for another case

1071
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,279
study and this time people who really

1072
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,380
thought about it but they still

1073
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,930
it up

1074
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:46,250
so Hezbollah also operational security

1075
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:47,440
experts they're very good at what they

1076
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:50,450
do

1077
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,940
this guy is Ruffy kerreri he was the

1078
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:57,310
former prime minister of Lebanon who had

1079
00:43:52,940 --> 00:44:00,200
just resigned in 2004 his net worth was

1080
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:03,380
16 billion dollars when he resigned from

1081
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,879
office so definitely a corrupt

1082
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,800
 right like you know if

1083
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,650
you're a politician and you leave office

1084
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,450
with 16 billion dollars you know you

1085
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:13,880
probably deserve what happened to this

1086
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:15,640
guy which was that Hezbollah blew him up

1087
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,350
with a giant car bomb

1088
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,910
unfortunately the 22 other people that

1089
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:23,000
got killed by that car bomb mostly

1090
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:24,920
probably didn't deserve it anyway this

1091
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,930
assassination which took again took

1092
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:30,010
place after

1093
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:33,009
resigned from office interestingly was

1094
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:34,630
pinned on Hezbollah even though someone

1095
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:38,069
caught up and took responsibility for it

1096
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:41,950
who was not Hezbollah a guy you know

1097
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:45,819
sent in a jihad video saying like I'm a

1098
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:48,819
member of some you know obscure you know

1099
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:52,390
political violence organization I did

1100
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:54,910
the bombing here's my video and

1101
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,618
everything that I think I said that but

1102
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:59,828
nevertheless it was pinned on Hezbollah

1103
00:44:56,619 --> 00:45:03,520
well how do you think they they figured

1104
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:04,750
that you guessed that phones so let's

1105
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,240
take a quick look about how that how it

1106
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:11,640
went down here's a map of Beirut his uh

1107
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:14,890
Hariri leaving his home in a

1108
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:17,500
high-security six car motorcade will

1109
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:23,170
approve vehicles and everything the

1110
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:24,869
truck bomb started down here so Hariri

1111
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:31,869
goes to Parliament earlier in the day

1112
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:33,880
and the bomber starts going to and so

1113
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:36,849
was clocked going through a tunnel so

1114
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:40,089
they could see the phone signal being

1115
00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:45,760
active in the tunnel but then the Prime

1116
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:47,859
Minister stops at a cafe and the bomber

1117
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:53,470
somehow knew about that and he pulls

1118
00:45:47,859 --> 00:45:55,180
over and waits then later on they both

1119
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:57,848
go to the hotel and the bomb detonates

1120
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:03,240
kaboom so let's have a look at what

1121
00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:08,440
happened a guy who worked for the

1122
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:09,879
security services in Beirut is the one

1123
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,299
who started off putting all this

1124
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,200
together

1125
00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:15,790
so fabric 2005 the assassination first

1126
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,049
of all they started to look at the full

1127
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:18,400
you know they got went to the phone

1128
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:21,880
companies they got all the records as

1129
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,619
you do and they looked at colocation and

1130
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,210
interconnection right very similar

1131
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:27,250
things like with the CIA example and

1132
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:29,380
they identified a few different groups

1133
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:32,049
of phones that were most likely involved

1134
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:34,720
so one group three phones they called

1135
00:46:32,049 --> 00:46:37,320
the green group now these were purchased

1136
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,540
a long time before the operation

1137
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:43,950
relatively speaking almost a year but

1138
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:47,670
beforehand with fake IDs good work they

1139
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:49,200
paid for in cash also good and a lot of

1140
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:51,060
minutes we'll put on these phones like

1141
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,770
seven and a half thousand dollars or

1142
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:55,320
seven and three eight thousand dollars

1143
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:58,920
goes a long way in Lebanon on 40 minutes

1144
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:01,320
so they these phones were used a lot so

1145
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,230
these were the leadership communications

1146
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:06,750
phones for the conspiracy then we have

1147
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:09,210
the blue group eighteen phones these

1148
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:12,030
were acquired very early on from 2003

1149
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:16,980
once again fake IDs paid in cash and

1150
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:19,740
they were geo-located around Hariri

1151
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:21,270
constantly from about October 2004 so

1152
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,649
these guys were following him around and

1153
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,900
they were taking notes of everything

1154
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:27,180
that he did

1155
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,950
they will also collect hid co-located

1156
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:31,649
with the purchase of the truck the truck

1157
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:35,460
was purchased out of town again paid in

1158
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:36,570
cash and some guys just showed up and

1159
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,970
like yeah this truck looks pretty good

1160
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:40,740
but the track itself actually was stolen

1161
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:41,939
and was being sold so it was like there

1162
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:48,509
was an out totally different criminal

1163
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:50,880
network involved now here's a great

1164
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:53,040
up here so after the operation these

1165
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,770
were disposed of by a Hezbollah

1166
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,680
technician but he used one of them to

1167
00:47:55,770 --> 00:48:01,770
call his girlfriend

1168
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,879
based on yeah so we that was one of the

1169
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:05,370
things that really cemented the

1170
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,020
Hezbollah connection here there was also

1171
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:09,270
the yellow group similar sized yellow

1172
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:12,060
group and blue group kind of went took

1173
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:13,710
over from the other the yellow group did

1174
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:15,630
also surveillance of hurry and they also

1175
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:16,950
did a lot of scouting of the site where

1176
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:19,770
they were gonna plan to detonate the

1177
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:21,359
bomb then there was the purple group the

1178
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:23,759
pebble group small group only three

1179
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:26,160
phones this was what the coveting used

1180
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,620
they used it to recruit the guy who

1181
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:32,040
pretended to be the suicide bomber on

1182
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:33,750
the video and they were so it was they

1183
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,190
were located at a mosque where they

1184
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:37,140
recruited this guy which by the way I

1185
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:38,430
forgot to mention the reason they no he

1186
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:40,859
wasn't the guy who blew up the truck as

1187
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:42,660
they found shreds of the truck bomber

1188
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:44,250
and did DNA analysis and it wasn't the

1189
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:47,220
same guy so they knew that this was a

1190
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:48,839
fake cover story and then these ones

1191
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:51,238
were the ones that were

1192
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:53,308
present when payphones we use to call

1193
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:55,619
the media to call al-jazeera and pretend

1194
00:48:53,309 --> 00:48:58,049
hey I'm you know I'm some dude from some

1195
00:48:55,619 --> 00:49:01,349
other random jihad group and I'd love to

1196
00:48:58,049 --> 00:49:04,469
form a Prime Minister then there was the

1197
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:06,509
red group eight phones this was a set of

1198
00:49:04,469 --> 00:49:11,999
phones that were activated in January

1199
00:49:06,509 --> 00:49:14,640
2005 in a decoy location so Hezbollah

1200
00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:16,738
owns a certain part of Beirut like my

1201
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,180
bizzle is like a Hezbollah area so these

1202
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:20,039
ones were all activated somewhere else

1203
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:22,799
again to try and like draw attention

1204
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:25,049
away from Hezbollah two minutes before

1205
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:27,509
the bombing these phones were turned off

1206
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:29,400
would never switched on again they will

1207
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:31,469
also only ever relocate I only ever

1208
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,999
recharged in a decoys like decoy

1209
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:35,549
location so these these phones will only

1210
00:49:32,999 --> 00:49:38,038
ever powered on in a location that

1211
00:49:35,549 --> 00:49:40,650
didn't look like it was involved with

1212
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:42,509
Hezbollah oh so this was the operational

1213
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:44,579
team that was the one that was being

1214
00:49:42,509 --> 00:49:46,410
used just for the bombing and they

1215
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:47,640
another interesting detail you can you

1216
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:50,879
can look at you can go to these

1217
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:54,569
documents from the criminal court they

1218
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,489
did a trial run or maybe they attempted

1219
00:49:54,569 --> 00:49:58,140
an operational run a short time

1220
00:49:56,489 --> 00:49:59,460
beforehand and for whatever reason they

1221
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:01,229
didn't go through with the final bombing

1222
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,460
so this they they could see all this

1223
00:50:01,229 --> 00:50:04,529
from the metadata this that this

1224
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:07,680
operational team had had a go at it

1225
00:50:04,529 --> 00:50:10,950
either as practice or as an aborted

1226
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,660
attempt so what happened what's the

1227
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:16,319
outcome here five Hezbollah members

1228
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:19,410
again in ABS antia brought to an

1229
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:21,839
international court this guy owned AC

1230
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:23,038
was a member of the purple group so he's

1231
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:26,160
the guy who recruited the fake suicide

1232
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,719
bomber Sabra also in the purple group

1233
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,069
he's the one who called al-jazeera to

1234
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:31,319
deliver the fake jihad video which he

1235
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:33,239
hung in a bag on a tree and said he said

1236
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:35,519
go check this tree like can you imagine

1237
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:37,079
being part of the media and say yeah

1238
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,279
this phone call the guys like there's a

1239
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:39,599
thing hanging from a tree and if you

1240
00:50:38,279 --> 00:50:41,009
don't pick it up in 15 minutes you'll

1241
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,630
never see it and it's good play it's

1242
00:50:41,009 --> 00:50:46,799
like and we just looked Prime Minister

1243
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:47,999
you'd be like holy anyway merry he

1244
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:52,890
also in the couple group

1245
00:50:47,999 --> 00:50:54,479
so you're we're seeing a bit of a theme

1246
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:57,450
here it's the purple group who mostly

1247
00:50:54,479 --> 00:51:01,390
getting busted here this guy it

1248
00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:04,930
up he when he filed his income tax

1249
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:06,940
turn he had the purple phone and his

1250
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:09,879
personal phone on together in the same

1251
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:11,200
place so the government you and he also

1252
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,910
accidentally used his pebble phone to

1253
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,069
order furniture and then called the

1254
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:16,810
complaint when it wasn't delivered and

1255
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:18,970
it was co-located with one of the green

1256
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:22,090
phones so this guy was also part of the

1257
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:22,779
leadership conspiracy I a she was leader

1258
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:25,540
of the red group

1259
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,280
he actually had 11 phones two landlines

1260
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,920
five personal phones for operational

1261
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,390
phones including a green phone carried

1262
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,090
them all together so cope made the

1263
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:35,350
mistake of colocation and then Bhadra

1264
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:38,020
Dean was the leader of the green group

1265
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:39,130
he had thirteen phones they were

1266
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:42,910
frequently collocated but they never

1267
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:44,500
called each other he had some

1268
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:46,120
operational funds that he would destroy

1269
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,290
and then activate a new one but because

1270
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,759
of that sequential destruction

1271
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:50,920
activation they could tell that he was

1272
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:55,330
passing on one operation phone onto the

1273
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:58,060
other he was a little difficult to pack

1274
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:59,860
down because he had two separate

1275
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,390
identities and he had a whole bunch of

1276
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,590
mistresses and so he's calling his

1277
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:04,990
mistresses with a bunch of these phones

1278
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:07,510
and everything so complicated to unpick

1279
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:09,490
that but he was the he was the pizza

1280
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:10,840
node of the green group so he's the one

1281
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:12,100
they would all call him and then he

1282
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,840
would call the other person so he was

1283
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:16,630
the guy that the person in the middle

1284
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:18,580
there of the green group and he when the

1285
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:22,750
green phones would be activated his was

1286
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:24,640
the last one to to get a call so they

1287
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:27,040
started this trial in 2014 it's still in

1288
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,540
progress nothing's nothing's definitive

1289
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,310
has happened except for the fact that

1290
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:32,890
bad routine got assassinated in Syria

1291
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:35,740
into 2016 so he was part of the case is

1292
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:38,460
dead but the other guys are still you

1293
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:40,060
know this location there's their

1294
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,470
representatives are saying it's all

1295
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,549
circumstantial bla bla bla so be

1296
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:46,660
interesting to see what happens because

1297
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:49,210
it is in a way circumstantial so let's

1298
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:52,450
see what were the successes of this case

1299
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:53,980
study so well they purchased their

1300
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:55,779
phones early right so they didn't Tim

1301
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,190
poorly correlate their phone purchases

1302
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,300
with the operation that's great they

1303
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:01,930
didn't leave a paper trail they used

1304
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:04,720
cash they also purchased them in other

1305
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:06,339
places and they took care and where they

1306
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,470
bought them where they activated them

1307
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:10,750
didn't do it in the hezbollah district

1308
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:12,459
they had their team's pretty effectively

1309
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,090
compartmentalized with the exception of

1310
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,140
the purple green overlap because you

1311
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,060
one of the green guys has to be on the

1312
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:19,700
purple team with a did a good job so

1313
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:23,570
blue and yellow team no no idea

1314
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:25,250
right no one knows they destroy it

1315
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:26,920
destroyed the phones after the operation

1316
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:30,680
that was good that's what you have to do

1317
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:32,150
and then they did a lot of content

1318
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:36,649
protections so all of this stuff is

1319
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:38,660
metadata analysis they didn't allow any

1320
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:43,130
phones to be captured and recover

1321
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:44,859
content they you know kept all their

1322
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:48,620
communications as far as we know in code

1323
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:49,700
just like like the old-school mafia but

1324
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:51,650
you know there were some failures

1325
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,540
obviously because we know about it so

1326
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:56,210
they co-located with their personal

1327
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:59,150
phones so that allowed the

1328
00:53:56,210 --> 00:54:00,650
location-based data mining they

1329
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,850
co-located with the truck purchase rate

1330
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:02,720
they should have not brought the phones

1331
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:04,029
with them when they went to buy the

1332
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,109
truck

1333
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:09,230
the accidental use of the operational

1334
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:12,680
phone for the personal purchase the fact

1335
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:14,180
that the networks were closed allowed

1336
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,560
them to be categorized as which group

1337
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,910
was what okay not necessarily a problem

1338
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,440
it's not necessarily problem to know

1339
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:20,930
that the red phones are the operational

1340
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,250
team but the semi closed networks sort

1341
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:24,680
of allowed the hierarchy of the

1342
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:26,150
conspiracy to be uncovered and of course

1343
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,759
the disposal technician it up

1344
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:31,220
the caller's girlfriend very bad and

1345
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:33,140
then that sequential use of operational

1346
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:35,029
funds you need to overlap if you're

1347
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,470
gonna switch out phones they should be

1348
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:40,310
temporarily overlapped because the

1349
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:43,279
sequence can stand out so after all of

1350
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:45,259
this you might be thinking this

1351
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,060
sucks there's just no way we can do it

1352
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,590
like I know you said it's we can mediate

1353
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,850
not to use but we should just go phone

1354
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:52,150
lists at least for some parts of our

1355
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:54,170
operation but that has implications too

1356
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:57,110
it can introduce its own set of problems

1357
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:59,720
so for example the ability to have

1358
00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:02,540
flexibility right no no plan survives

1359
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:04,759
first contact with the enemy so not

1360
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:08,029
being able to change plans on the fly is

1361
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:10,150
also an OPSEC problem all right so we

1362
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:12,950
need to communicate on our team somehow

1363
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:15,680
maybe it's not where the phone so what

1364
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:20,000
else could we used well we could use

1365
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:22,450
radios right and that in fact the guy

1366
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,220
who figured out all the Hezbollah

1367
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:27,049
metadata stuff from the from the

1368
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:29,680
Lebanese security services has

1369
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:32,570
assassinated him later with a bomb and

1370
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,980
they didn't it up that time they

1371
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:35,360
didn't use any phones during the

1372
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:39,500
operation they use your ring they use

1373
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:41,120
radios so they learned of course if you

1374
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,470
use radios you've got range issues if

1375
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,880
you point-to-point you've got the range

1376
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:48,350
of the head handset otherwise you got to

1377
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:51,710
set up a repeater encryption is a pain

1378
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:54,319
on radios you can do it but it's not

1379
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:56,480
it's like you know there's not a lot of

1380
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:59,060
good turnkey solutions unless you have

1381
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,380
access to military equipment and then

1382
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:02,090
you've got to manage keys to like if

1383
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:03,470
you're doing your own point-to-point

1384
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:04,700
encryption then everyone's got to have

1385
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:06,080
the right keys you've got to distribute

1386
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:08,359
those and you got to make sure they

1387
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,950
don't fall into the wrong hands and of

1388
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,060
course anything that's transmitting is

1389
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,770
subject to radiofrequency

1390
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:14,930
direction-finding but that's something

1391
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:16,430
that has to be in place rather you can't

1392
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:18,350
it's not like metadata where they can go

1393
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:22,310
after the fact and just get it from the

1394
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:25,520
phone companies now I used to advise

1395
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:28,100
people what about just using a Wi-Fi

1396
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,620
only mobile device and hotend messaging

1397
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:33,950
apps right something like the iPod Touch

1398
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:35,390
which I used to be a big fan of you've

1399
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:38,120
got to deal with the fact that sometimes

1400
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:39,770
you don't have Wi-Fi and so the

1401
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:42,589
reliability of access and you've got to

1402
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:45,020
make sure you you know have your COMSEC

1403
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:46,460
in place with open you know if you're

1404
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:49,570
gonna use the Starbucks Wi-Fi or

1405
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:52,160
anything just like don't that up

1406
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:58,400
but there there are other OPSEC

1407
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:59,450
implications such as IP geolocation you

1408
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,250
know you can deal with that stuff but

1409
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:02,540
the big one the reason why I hesitate to

1410
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:05,330
recommend this is the endpoint security

1411
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:06,860
is just as bad right those I asked

1412
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:08,810
zero-days the Chinese government is

1413
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:11,090
deploying against iPhones they also work

1414
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:13,759
against iPod Touches and they also work

1415
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:15,710
against you know whatever your have a

1416
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,140
you know there are also bugs available

1417
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:20,270
for other smartphone like devices that

1418
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:23,029
aren't smartphones so you know that's a

1419
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:25,970
longer story than we can cover in this

1420
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:27,920
presentation but just be aware of it and

1421
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:30,500
then also not having a phone on you

1422
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,030
these days people say oh what's wrong

1423
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:35,180
with you right that can appear

1424
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:36,710
suspicious although that's a little bit

1425
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:38,569
counterbalanced by if you normally have

1426
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:41,240
one and you're creating a

1427
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:43,010
a pattern of normal life and the phone

1428
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:46,580
doesn't move as long as you don't get

1429
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:49,190
caught without it you also haven't moved

1430
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:51,830
right so that's you can sort of falsify

1431
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:54,440
your metadata that way so on that note

1432
00:57:51,830 --> 00:58:01,120
case study number three what the Chinese

1433
00:57:54,440 --> 00:58:04,310
government is up to right now they are

1434
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:05,930
you know surveilling the out of

1435
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:08,360
their population starting off with the

1436
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:10,129
weakest who I mentioned earlier and they

1437
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,990
have a social surveillance system that's

1438
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:14,690
been made for the government by Chinese

1439
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:16,370
contractors called I job the integrated

1440
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:19,160
joint operations platform which is

1441
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:21,710
basically an app based sensor network it

1442
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:24,529
takes in manually inputted information

1443
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:26,390
from police checkpoints and then also

1444
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:28,520
tied in to face recognition systems

1445
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:29,870
whichever are in China now and these

1446
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:33,080
checkpoints that you see up on the

1447
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:35,980
screen here that more prominent in areas

1448
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:38,290
like shinjang and like Tibet but they're

1449
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:42,260
you know more or less all over the place

1450
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:43,820
so this I jump app well at least the

1451
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:45,230
phone app part of it so this is I think

1452
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,550
all the police have on their phones was

1453
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,620
reverse engineered by Human Rights Watch

1454
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:52,120
and a security group from Germany called

1455
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:55,279
QR 53 late last year earlier this year

1456
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:57,770
and so this thing basically is designed

1457
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,600
to slow up up a lot of information and

1458
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:02,480
track people's activities and flag their

1459
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,020
anomalous behavior in particular their

1460
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,030
phone use

1461
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:07,040
so the communications they're doing the

1462
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:09,470
web browsing the types of software that

1463
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:12,020
are installed the phone and of course as

1464
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:13,370
if the things that are red flags like

1465
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:15,770
this makes you look like a person of

1466
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:17,089
interest is if the track the phone shows

1467
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:19,280
up at a location that's outside where

1468
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:20,420
your normal activities should be so

1469
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,920
here's a screenshot that's been

1470
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:25,100
translated from Chinese into English

1471
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,870
showing the things that can be and so

1472
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:28,819
one of the things there is reason for no

1473
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:32,060
trajectory information like why why

1474
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:34,060
hasn't your phone been used if you use

1475
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:37,130
the phone that's not registered to you

1476
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:39,230
that's a red flag if you're registered

1477
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:41,330
to a phone that disappeared that's a red

1478
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:42,560
flag if you've changed phone numbers

1479
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:46,250
recently or someone you're related to

1480
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:48,320
has changed them use smart phones in the

1481
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,940
past but has stopped together are using

1482
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,190
only analog phones that's a direct

1483
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:54,730
translation of

1484
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:57,700
that the Chinese in the app so what this

1485
00:59:54,730 --> 01:00:00,780
all adds up to is that in a repressive

1486
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:03,040
state like China the phone is now a

1487
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:05,260
personal ID it's that it's like your

1488
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,810
driver's license or your passport except

1489
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:11,710
it's also got real-time tracking

1490
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:15,610
capability so that's a sort of a whole

1491
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:18,670
new level of OPSEC required very very

1492
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:20,770
difficult right you if you can avoid

1493
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:22,240
checkpoints then you might be able to

1494
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:23,650
move around just like you can get around

1495
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,970
without your driver's license if you

1496
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:26,560
don't if you're not driving if you don't

1497
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:28,419
get pulled over by the police and you

1498
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:31,600
can go within that country without your

1499
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:32,830
passport in most countries anyway so you

1500
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,330
can you know if you can travel without

1501
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:36,819
your phone and not get questioned by the

1502
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,810
police you know maybe that's okay but

1503
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,760
that's really hard for the wee goes

1504
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:41,230
because they're being racially profiled

1505
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,030
so they've the Chinese government is

1506
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:46,480
developing facial recognition systems

1507
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:48,190
that also have a demographic group

1508
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,530
recognition capability like you look

1509
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:51,760
like a weigert we're gonna pull you in

1510
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:52,720
and check your phone and stuff like that

1511
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,610
so that's just a very difficult

1512
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:57,040
situation there's probably not too many

1513
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:58,750
offset tips that I can give for people

1514
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:03,400
who are under that kind of level of

1515
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:06,970
surveillance but so here is the summary

1516
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:10,270
advice that I can give for using burner

1517
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:15,189
phones for your operational operational

1518
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:18,730
needs here's all the do's first purchase

1519
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:20,230
them in advance so and be careful where

1520
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:22,570
you purchase them because people have

1521
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:23,910
been caught from the surveillance videos

1522
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:26,320
like they go to a Walmart or whatever

1523
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:29,350
and they pull the surveillance video

1524
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:30,670
that surveillance video usually gets

1525
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:31,960
rolled over up there sometimes that's

1526
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:36,180
just another reason to purchase things

1527
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:39,310
fire in advance and of course pay cash

1528
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:40,990
when you register your phones do it far

1529
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:42,610
away from your operational area because

1530
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:43,720
geolocation of those phone stops as soon

1531
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:46,600
as you turn them on and activate them

1532
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,980
and don't register all your groups

1533
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:51,910
burner phones at the same time and in

1534
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:54,520
the same place of course tell lies to

1535
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:59,049
the phone companies those bastards don't

1536
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:00,250
deserve anything better dumb phones are

1537
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:04,150
better than smart phones for the most

1538
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:04,630
part again no knowing that the cheapest

1539
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:06,760
possible

1540
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:10,600
some phones may stand out in a in a

1541
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:11,980
wealthy country but basically the

1542
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,299
smartphone's attack surface and data

1543
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:15,160
leakage just isn't worth the risk if

1544
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:17,140
you've got a serious operation that's

1545
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:19,270
that you're gonna get seriously

1546
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:20,379
if you get caught it's just not worth

1547
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:24,130
the risk

1548
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:25,630
don't be all the same type and if you

1549
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:28,240
want to go the secure messaging route

1550
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:31,630
you can use other internet devices that

1551
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:34,479
aren't phones definitely remove the

1552
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:36,010
battery it's the only way that you can

1553
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:39,850
trust the baseband processor if it

1554
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:42,040
doesn't have power fill your phones with

1555
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:43,000
fake contacts anything

1556
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,470
don't put real contacts in there

1557
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,370
obviously but fake ones are good too

1558
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:49,959
because they can be leaked and if you

1559
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:51,970
get searched and you've got a phone with

1560
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:57,100
no contacts in it that can also look

1561
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:59,169
suspicious then you know use your

1562
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:01,360
operational phones only as needed

1563
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:05,550
including doing your periodic metadata

1564
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:08,170
faking and remember that creating

1565
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:10,210
plausible misleading metadata is more

1566
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:11,470
difficult than not creating metadata at

1567
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:14,830
all you pull the battery out you're not

1568
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:16,870
creating metadata but you know making a

1569
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:21,360
plausible fake story is hard it takes

1570
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:21,359
thought so make a plan and stick to it

1571
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:26,650
when you switch locations also switch

1572
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,980
phones that one of the easiest ways to

1573
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:31,870
not up the location switching part

1574
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:33,400
is to just leave phones in their

1575
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:37,240
operational locations and pick them up

1576
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:38,920
when you get there and then that

1577
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:45,459
minimizes the risk that you'll do act

1578
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:48,360
accidental cross disclosure falsify your

1579
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:51,460
call network so call unrelated numbers

1580
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:53,520
within realistic window periods to

1581
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:55,780
thwart graph analysis techniques and

1582
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:59,610
avoid pizza notes when you're exiting

1583
01:03:55,780 --> 01:04:01,690
your closed loops and then obviously

1584
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:03,850
don't have your group all use the same

1585
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:05,980
false numbers you know there's a lot of

1586
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:10,750
these things seem obvious but you know

1587
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:13,720
even the CIA it up security

1588
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:16,090
through obscurity actually can totally

1589
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,890
help right like we in like InfoSec and

1590
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:18,460
an hacker conference like we always like

1591
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:20,379
to sort of make

1592
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:22,720
of security by obscurity but the

1593
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:24,430
creative security does help if as you

1594
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:27,520
pay attention for the obscurity pot

1595
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:29,819
right so learn from the Mafia who your

1596
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,720
masters at this right they beat a lot of

1597
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:33,310
indictments because they just talked

1598
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,959
what seemed to be gibberish their phones

1599
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:36,009
were tapped but no one could tell what

1600
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,270
they were talking about because they had

1601
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:39,520
everyone had a nickname everyone had

1602
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:41,020
liked the stuff all the scams they were

1603
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:43,450
running all had like operational code

1604
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:45,550
names and stuff or if you don't want to

1605
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:47,348
feel like you're you know emulating the

1606
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:48,940
Mafia then you can emulate the the

1607
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:50,560
famous Navajo code talkers in World War

1608
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:52,630
2 which is exactly the same thing right

1609
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:55,180
the Japanese were intercepting

1610
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:57,369
transmissions and so the u.s. wanted a

1611
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:58,509
group that even if their transmissions

1612
01:04:57,369 --> 01:05:00,790
were intercepted the Japanese would

1613
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:03,400
never figure it out so they got Native

1614
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:05,140
American Navajo native language speakers

1615
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,450
to talk about you know they had code

1616
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:08,799
words like a tank was the Navajo word

1617
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:11,220
for a turtle or something like that the

1618
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:14,560
Japanese never figured it out

1619
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:18,520
so all that kind of code that really

1620
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:21,820
helps if or I should say when one of

1621
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:25,810
your endpoints gets compromised or one

1622
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:29,560
of your you know someone gets subject to

1623
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:31,750
a wiretap remember what each phone is

1624
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:35,859
for and only use it for that purpose

1625
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:38,890
and thou shalt always kill when you

1626
01:05:35,859 --> 01:05:42,190
retire a phone dispose of it properly

1627
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:44,230
make sure it's never ever used again and

1628
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:47,710
then here are the don'ts so obviously

1629
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:49,599
don't co-localize don't allow a phone to

1630
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:53,080
be on in a location that you can be

1631
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:54,609
personally placed at and don't allow a

1632
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,630
phone to be on at the same time in place

1633
01:05:54,609 --> 01:05:58,950
as another phone that you're using

1634
01:05:55,630 --> 01:06:01,960
whether it's an operational phone or not

1635
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:05,049
don't activate phones in the same time

1636
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:06,820
or place and don't call other related

1637
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:07,960
phones from your buona phone because

1638
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:10,510
that's gonna bring them into your Bonin

1639
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,980
Network and don't call unrelated phones

1640
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:15,400
from different burners because that

1641
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:18,400
correlates them together don't still

1642
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:20,710
real data end points are definitely the

1643
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:23,410
weakest link don't neglect the fact that

1644
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:27,220
people through no real fault of their

1645
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:29,770
own lose phones or they get stolen or

1646
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:31,598
they get confiscated you know by the

1647
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:32,140
police so whoever like these these kind

1648
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:34,030
of accident

1649
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:38,500
happen and your operations should be

1650
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:41,020
robust to these kinds of accidents and

1651
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:42,790
don't temporarily him poorly correlate

1652
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:46,630
last use and first use when your switch

1653
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:49,870
bun is that really stands out and then

1654
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:51,730
don't use online services that can

1655
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:53,859
produce metadata that connect can

1656
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:55,480
connect sub networks right so then check

1657
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:55,930
your Gmail with your with your burner

1658
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,990
phone

1659
01:06:55,930 --> 01:07:00,100
don't buy furniture with your burner

1660
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:03,189
phone if you're if you're on the

1661
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:05,650
Hezbollah operational team and then when

1662
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:08,080
you refill them do it as anonymously as

1663
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:11,500
possible that's getting hotter in in

1664
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:13,630
modern society you know caches cache is

1665
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,580
going away but you can still in many

1666
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:21,360
cases buy these anonymous prepaid cards

1667
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:21,360
and use them so here's my final advice

1668
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:30,220
just be careful you know be intelligent

1669
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:33,130
about what you're doing it's really

1670
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:35,049
really hot right anonymity is hot like

1671
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:37,660
talk to any other tor people about how

1672
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:39,970
hard they work to make anonymity work on

1673
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:42,700
the Internet it's it's very very

1674
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:44,230
difficult and it's only getting worse as

1675
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:47,350
everything gets more connected and as

1676
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:48,700
storage gets cheaper or you know if you

1677
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:53,560
live in China it's getting pretty close

1678
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:55,210
to impossible so you know it's hard but

1679
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,970
it's worth your effort if your life is

1680
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:59,440
at stake if your freedom is at stake

1681
01:07:56,970 --> 01:08:01,419
then take it seriously you know I don't

1682
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:06,400
want to see anyone in this room in

1683
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:13,150
prison or hit by a drone strike I love

1684
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:15,130
you all OPSEC is a 24/7 job you know of

1685
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:16,870
course you got to decide on your threat

1686
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:18,700
model maybe you're not maybe don't care

1687
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:21,430
about nation-state intelligence agencies

1688
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:23,679
but plan an act according to it and then

1689
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:25,570
read team your own plan you know think

1690
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:28,210
about it like if you were given a

1691
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:29,920
massive database of location time cold

1692
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:31,810
destination coal length metadata what

1693
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:34,930
would you do with it this stuff is kind

1694
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:36,940
of predictable actually or a privileged

1695
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:40,480
view of the network if you can think of

1696
01:08:36,939 --> 01:08:43,000
it you can guarantee that some person at

1697
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:45,120
GCHQ or NSA is getting paid to work on

1698
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,120
this

1699
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:51,540
and follow the up set guide you know do

1700
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:53,259
what makes sense for you to resist

1701
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:54,729
massive surveillance

1702
01:08:53,259 --> 01:08:57,310
I think massive surveillance is bad I

1703
01:08:54,729 --> 01:08:58,540
think it said you need to resist it so

1704
01:08:57,310 --> 01:09:01,270
but do it in a way that makes sense for

1705
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:03,009
you if you're a we get in China makes

1706
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:05,889
very it's very different than if you're

1707
01:09:03,009 --> 01:09:07,238
a Hezbollah member or if you're a animal

1708
01:09:05,889 --> 01:09:09,130
rights activist group which have been

1709
01:09:07,238 --> 01:09:10,658
targeted by the FBI in the United States

1710
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:12,880
there's lots of lots of reasons why you

1711
01:09:10,658 --> 01:09:15,278
might be you know not committing bad

1712
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,449
crimes but you still want to make use of

1713
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:21,900
this information so that's my advice

1714
01:09:18,448 --> 01:09:21,899
good luck to you all

1715
01:09:28,609 --> 01:09:32,809
I totally alright maybe I didn't run

1716
01:09:31,249 --> 01:09:34,488
over time because I started a 15 minutes

1717
01:09:32,809 --> 01:09:35,538
after so anyway maybe but we've got time

1718
01:09:34,488 --> 01:09:37,038
for questions I don't think anything's

1719
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:41,509
really scheduled except the hairy Kaka

1720
01:09:37,038 --> 01:09:44,059
karaoke is coming up next I have

1721
01:09:41,509 --> 01:09:47,059
something interesting to add I guess I

1722
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:49,119
had about a year ago a phone call from

1723
01:09:47,059 --> 01:09:52,670
my credit-card company that they blocked

1724
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:54,619
fraud transaction which was correct and

1725
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:56,659
I managed to get that person to talk for

1726
01:09:54,619 --> 01:09:59,509
the next hour how they work and they

1727
01:09:56,659 --> 01:10:02,239
work I mean ultimately credit card

1728
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:03,829
companies are the same as every spy

1729
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:07,489
agency because they want to prevent

1730
01:10:03,829 --> 01:10:09,440
fraud so you can communicate with them I

1731
01:10:07,489 --> 01:10:11,509
did once when I wanted to do a

1732
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,400
transaction on my prepaid card to book

1733
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:15,710
two individual things I did two

1734
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:17,420
transactions to my credit card to tell

1735
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:19,190
them yes this is intentional and they

1736
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:20,929
were like yeah when we actually saw that

1737
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:24,829
and that's why it went through because I

1738
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:28,760
expected it to fail and also they know

1739
01:10:24,829 --> 01:10:30,768
because I fly with air Serbia or with my

1740
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:33,920
domestic carrier over here to Serbia

1741
01:10:30,769 --> 01:10:35,599
they told this indirectly tells you if

1742
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,030
you want to go to a place and you don't

1743
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:40,070
want to track don't use the national

1744
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:43,550
carrier and pay with your credit card

1745
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:44,960
use some other carrier yeah that's

1746
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:45,980
that's something actually I've talked to

1747
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,320
people who work in the credit card

1748
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:50,539
industry too and they're very upfront

1749
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:53,739
about the fact that they use plane

1750
01:10:50,539 --> 01:10:57,829
ticket destinations to figure out

1751
01:10:53,739 --> 01:10:59,629
whether or not purchases are real in

1752
01:10:57,829 --> 01:11:01,759
their fraud detection unit so they that

1753
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:03,619
there's there's some data that they're

1754
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,210
like they're legally not supposed to

1755
01:11:03,619 --> 01:11:07,969
mine but they are completely upfront

1756
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:11,499
about the fact that they mine air ticket

1757
01:11:07,969 --> 01:11:13,940
information from on your credit card

1758
01:11:11,499 --> 01:11:19,239
okay so you've convinced me I'm gonna

1759
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:22,699
get a bunch of burner phones do I Drive

1760
01:11:19,239 --> 01:11:26,209
to a location to pick these up do I take

1761
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:28,369
a plane and make a connection and then

1762
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:30,380
end up in a city but my connection do I

1763
01:11:28,369 --> 01:11:31,639
pick up the phones how do I get these

1764
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:34,010
because I feel like if I try if I'm

1765
01:11:31,639 --> 01:11:37,179
gonna get tolls if I fly they're gonna

1766
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:38,980
log me what do I do I'm paranoid now

1767
01:11:37,179 --> 01:11:41,290
yeah you know

1768
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:42,699
there's that the tracking problem is

1769
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:44,290
getting worse and it depends on the

1770
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:47,349
individual country but public transport

1771
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:49,600
is good they there's a lot of camera

1772
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:51,790
surveillance on public transport but

1773
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,340
they have rolling buffers so again

1774
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:58,989
advanced purchases will help you on

1775
01:11:54,340 --> 01:12:01,060
public transport the certainly avoid

1776
01:11:58,989 --> 01:12:04,330
tolls there's very there's very little

1777
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:06,640
information on retention for at least in

1778
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:08,910
the United States for automated

1779
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:12,130
license-plate recognition systems

1780
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:13,330
there's very little legislation related

1781
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:15,550
to them and the police are very cagey

1782
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:17,559
about anything involving them so

1783
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:19,090
retention and stuff like that and they

1784
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,920
now they have mobile units to so you

1785
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:23,710
even avoiding tolls doesn't help you

1786
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:25,510
because police cars drive around with

1787
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:28,570
these ALPR systems and they just capture

1788
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:30,100
and some some local areas like in

1789
01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:33,190
California they've made some laws now on

1790
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:34,390
retention but the the law enforcement

1791
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:36,428
loved them and so they're very cagey

1792
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:38,410
about what they do with them but yeah

1793
01:12:36,429 --> 01:12:40,960
you know you're at you're an athlete so

1794
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:44,590
you should run to the to the store and

1795
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:46,989
buy your phones sign note from an

1796
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:49,239
opposite perspective you can you buy

1797
01:12:46,989 --> 01:12:51,820
cash for interval tickets you can buy

1798
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:53,500
them for up to three months and even if

1799
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:56,620
it says you have to show your passport

1800
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:59,320
I've had to show it twice in the last

1801
01:12:56,620 --> 01:13:01,750
two months yeah also I think it's pretty

1802
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:03,730
it's pretty much not illegal to show

1803
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,830
fake IDs to people who aren't working

1804
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:07,089
for the government or law enforcement

1805
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:08,739
like I personally would totally feel

1806
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:11,100
fine about showing fake ID to the train

1807
01:13:08,739 --> 01:13:11,099
clerk

1808
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:22,010
thanks for the talk sauce do you have

1809
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:23,709
any recommendations for people who

1810
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:27,050
intend to go to the United States

1811
01:13:23,709 --> 01:13:29,030
because you know I I do intend to go

1812
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:31,820
there I don't want to have my personal

1813
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:33,590
phone searched but I figured that buying

1814
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:36,590
a burner phone will make them very

1815
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:37,729
suspicious well actually I do have some

1816
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:39,380
advice about that I'm glad that you

1817
01:13:37,729 --> 01:13:41,329
mentioned that so there was a case that

1818
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:46,489
just came up in the last couple of weeks

1819
01:13:41,329 --> 01:13:48,139
where a freshman at Harvard was coming

1820
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:49,848
to the United States to start the year

1821
01:13:48,139 --> 01:13:52,489
because the academic year in the United

1822
01:13:49,849 --> 01:13:55,070
States starts in September and he had a

1823
01:13:52,489 --> 01:13:56,839
visa and he got to the airport in the

1824
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:59,268
United States and they asked him to

1825
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:01,400
unlock his phone and his laptop which he

1826
01:13:59,269 --> 01:14:04,760
did and they went through everything on

1827
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:06,888
the devices and they read people that he

1828
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:08,389
was following on social media had

1829
01:14:06,889 --> 01:14:10,159
written some bad things about the United

1830
01:14:08,389 --> 01:14:12,979
States so you know who knows what it was

1831
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:16,339
like bad right like they just said

1832
01:14:12,979 --> 01:14:18,349
Trump or whatever I don't know but um so

1833
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:20,630
they cancel these they didn't like what

1834
01:14:18,349 --> 01:14:22,099
they saw even though he hadn't retweeted

1835
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:23,809
that and he hadn't written it himself

1836
01:14:22,099 --> 01:14:26,929
and they cancelled his visa and sent him

1837
01:14:23,809 --> 01:14:29,209
to him away so I think that's some

1838
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:33,400
pretty good lessons in that which is if

1839
01:14:29,209 --> 01:14:36,320
you think that you are of interest just

1840
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,249
don't bring anything with you that

1841
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:39,499
you're gonna get in that situation

1842
01:14:37,249 --> 01:14:41,389
they're gonna they can't ask you to

1843
01:14:39,499 --> 01:14:44,630
unlock your devices if if you're on a

1844
01:14:41,389 --> 01:14:46,999
visa and you say no they totally can

1845
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:48,499
just send you home right so it's best to

1846
01:14:46,999 --> 01:14:50,449
have something that you can unlock for

1847
01:14:48,499 --> 01:14:52,849
them and for what's on that phone to

1848
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:54,589
look innocuous I don't think at this

1849
01:14:52,849 --> 01:14:58,219
point that a done more feature phone

1850
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:59,570
will put you on any radar but given the

1851
01:14:58,219 --> 01:15:03,619
fact that Trump has been very upfront

1852
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:06,829
about a Muslim ban right this guy coming

1853
01:15:03,619 --> 01:15:08,749
from Palestine to go to Harvard I think

1854
01:15:06,829 --> 01:15:09,978
should have known better it's I mean

1855
01:15:08,749 --> 01:15:11,659
that's like that's a little that's a

1856
01:15:09,979 --> 01:15:13,280
little bit of a callous thing to say but

1857
01:15:11,659 --> 01:15:16,728
if I was him I would have mailed my

1858
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:18,199
devices in an encrypted state to myself

1859
01:15:16,729 --> 01:15:21,189
at Harvard and then traveled without

1860
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:25,428
them or travel with a an innocuous

1861
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:27,870
feature phone because the US border is a

1862
01:15:25,429 --> 01:15:30,780
kind of a lawless state right now

1863
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:32,880
they have taken you know the the fact

1864
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:35,160
that they can search your bags they've

1865
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:37,170
taken to me and all your devices to if

1866
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,340
you're a citizen they can confiscate the

1867
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:39,540
devices but they can't stop you from

1868
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:41,910
entering the country but if you're a non

1869
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:43,200
citizen they can just say you're on

1870
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:47,059
the next plane out of here

1871
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:49,440
so again if you if your threat model

1872
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:51,510
includes being searched at the US border

1873
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:54,540
as a non citizen then I would not take a

1874
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:57,590
device that I was not prepared to unlock

1875
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:57,590
and have inspected

1876
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:07,330
you mentioned during a presentation that

1877
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:14,050
four burner phones or even regular

1878
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:17,200
phones you should remove battery from

1879
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:19,780
them I've heard similar stories from

1880
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:23,440
people who know people who know guys in

1881
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:27,490
our security service has there ever been

1882
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:33,519
proven at at least one type of phone

1883
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:36,480
that when the battery is still in you

1884
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:41,100
switch it off but it can still do things

1885
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:43,349
have been well it's certainly true of

1886
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:48,070
phones without removable batteries

1887
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:50,860
they're always on you know the when you

1888
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:52,269
press the on button there's a processor

1889
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:56,710
that's in a low-power mode that's

1890
01:16:52,270 --> 01:17:01,030
monitoring that switch and it so it's

1891
01:16:56,710 --> 01:17:03,760
certainly known that that the the device

1892
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:05,710
is active in some way and so once you

1893
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,740
have that knowledge you can never

1894
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:11,410
guarantee that it's not doing anything

1895
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:13,269
so I don't have a specific example of a

1896
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:16,750
specific device that was like

1897
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:19,380
quote-unquote turned off but still but

1898
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:23,100
still transmitting so I'm not aware of a

1899
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:23,100
verified example of that

1900
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:40,960
so that's no than the concept they were

1901
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:43,389
measuring the activity right off 1000

1902
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:47,860
and certain parts of the phone you have

1903
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:51,190
they actually proven yeah they didn't

1904
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:54,040
have a device that was doing a bad

1905
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:56,730
unknown bad thing it was more of a

1906
01:17:54,040 --> 01:18:00,040
what-if proof-of-concept

1907
01:17:56,730 --> 01:18:02,070
because you also can't know all possible

1908
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:04,900
malware's right

1909
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:06,570
once malware is installed on a device it

1910
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:09,969
can do very different things from what a

1911
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:12,400
stock patched non malware infected

1912
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:14,470
device can do so you could totally write

1913
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:16,330
a proof of concept you know if you if

1914
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:17,710
you route a phone you can write some

1915
01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:18,850
software that makes the phone to

1916
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:21,310
whatever you want to

1917
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:24,310
so it's certainly true that it's

1918
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:27,070
possible whether or not such now where

1919
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:29,980
has been discovered in the wild I don't

1920
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:31,509
know but if it's possible and if your

1921
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:33,990
life is at stake you should defend

1922
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:33,990
against it

1923
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:39,820
a little related in phones that you

1924
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:43,030
can't remove the battery how do you feel

1925
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:46,469
about using Faraday cages you know I

1926
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:46,469
think it's okay but you should test it

1927
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:51,730
you know people I think that's been I

1928
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:53,080
think there are some examples out there

1929
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:54,459
where you can see like people have stuck

1930
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:58,230
the phone in the microwave or whatever

1931
01:18:54,460 --> 01:19:00,700
and then they've like measured it and

1932
01:18:58,230 --> 01:19:01,870
you know spoiler sometimes it works and

1933
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:04,900
sometimes it doesn't it depends on the

1934
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:07,320
cage and there's also there's actually a

1935
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:09,129
whole group of people that are

1936
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:10,540
interested in this for completely

1937
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:13,750
different reasons they're the Doomsday

1938
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:15,670
Preppers and they do EMP protection you

1939
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:18,310
know so they bury radios and stuff on

1940
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:20,380
the ground in case there's a nuclear war

1941
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:22,690
and the electronic cell gets fried and

1942
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:25,660
they have documentation on like how

1943
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:28,650
deeply you have to bury things to verify

1944
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:28,650
that it won't get destroyed

1945
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:45,260
like it I would also like to emphasize

1946
01:19:41,059 --> 01:19:47,780
that's not so much only about being a

1947
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:50,780
criminal person doing something wrong

1948
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:52,820
it's also I've been for an instable for

1949
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:55,400
example and it's simple really changed

1950
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:58,489
radically and also if you look at

1951
01:19:55,400 --> 01:20:00,699
Germany its worst police you're actually

1952
01:19:58,489 --> 01:20:06,019
giving information private information

1953
01:20:00,699 --> 01:20:08,629
to right-wing people and I think it's

1954
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:10,429
more like digital self-defense not

1955
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:14,210
planning doing something along it's

1956
01:20:10,429 --> 01:20:19,130
really something we need to how somehow

1957
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:22,130
to be able to to protect ourselves yeah

1958
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:25,670
I totally agree and I hope that you know

1959
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:26,719
I was partly being flippant and trying

1960
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:28,489
to amuse people with the whole

1961
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,510
committing crimes thing I also very

1962
01:20:28,489 --> 01:20:35,150
strongly agree with what you're saying

1963
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:37,340
but I will say that the amount of ovale

1964
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:40,848
of cognitive load that it takes to do

1965
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:42,230
this level of OPSEC is extremely

1966
01:20:40,849 --> 01:20:45,619
extremely high and it's not really

1967
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:46,940
maintainable I think for people who are

1968
01:20:45,619 --> 01:20:49,639
just trying to live their normal lives

1969
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:51,400
and don't want their information to be

1970
01:20:49,639 --> 01:20:54,559
possibly used against them by rogue

1971
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:56,210
security services it's just it's not

1972
01:20:54,559 --> 01:20:58,909
really reasonable to ask people to do

1973
01:20:56,210 --> 01:21:00,559
that you know people have valid personal

1974
01:20:58,909 --> 01:21:02,480
reasons why they want to carry phones

1975
01:21:00,559 --> 01:21:04,309
and use them normally so it's also

1976
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:07,339
really important from a privacy

1977
01:21:04,309 --> 01:21:09,650
standpoint that we have you know good

1978
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:11,690
legislation in place and accountability

1979
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:12,799
of the security services and that's

1980
01:21:11,690 --> 01:21:15,530
something we just have to work on

1981
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,030
politically and I think Germany's at the

1982
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:19,849
forefront of that in in some ways

1983
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:21,650
because they had the experience you know

1984
01:21:19,849 --> 01:21:25,250
the Stasi and so on and they remember

1985
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:27,049
what it was like so you know that being

1986
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:29,710
politically active on this front is

1987
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:29,710
really important

1988
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:38,719
okay so a bit different question now you

1989
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:41,360
went through the hairs block detailed

1990
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:43,670
plan and all the hierarchy under all the

1991
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:46,040
details that were put into into it and

1992
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:48,890
you had people fairly anonymous involved

1993
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:51,800
in that but an anonymous to the security

1994
01:21:48,890 --> 01:21:54,920
services or whoever and then you've got

1995
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:57,590
the situation where head of state is

1996
01:21:54,920 --> 01:22:00,230
tweeting a very sensitive satellite

1997
01:21:57,590 --> 01:22:03,920
photo of the lamp site reviewing way too

1998
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:08,360
much so if let's see if organizations

1999
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:11,300
like us block working in let's say a

2000
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:13,730
lower technology level environments are

2001
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:17,360
paying so much attention and this is a

2002
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:19,489
person that is very surrounded with

2003
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:22,519
people that are aware even more than we

2004
01:22:19,489 --> 01:22:26,449
are here the possible threats and does

2005
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:29,060
that how much is that really ignorant or

2006
01:22:26,449 --> 01:22:32,030
just don't care I'm just wondering

2007
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:34,820
because it seems impossible to me that

2008
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:36,830
it's just ignorance or yeah it's really

2009
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:38,360
hard to know you know I mean that's that

2010
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:40,940
situation is just crazy and it's like

2011
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:42,830
it's sort of interesting be your

2012
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:45,259
conversation about like how must how

2013
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:46,820
must the intelligence agencies feel when

2014
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:50,360
they're like trying to that they're

2015
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:51,799
assigned to protect this guy and he's

2016
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:53,839
just like completely crazy

2017
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,909
or like you know imagine what kinds of

2018
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,800
malware are on that phone you know like

2019
01:22:55,909 --> 01:22:59,210
they told him not to use his own phone

2020
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:02,170
and he said no I'm gonna use my own

2021
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:04,159
phone so like you know every every

2022
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:05,600
intelligence agency in the world must be

2023
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:07,489
trying to get some get an implant on

2024
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:10,330
that phone how many times have they been

2025
01:23:07,489 --> 01:23:10,330
successful who knows

2026
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:15,009
hey more questions

2027
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:23,910
thanks for the talk I would like to

2028
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:27,750
share my experience with the American

2029
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:30,840
custom since we did start this theme I

2030
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:34,770
was traveling to USA in 2002 just one

2031
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:36,870
year after the 9/11 and I think they

2032
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:40,110
they were the peak of their paranoia at

2033
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:41,670
that moment I suppose and I was

2034
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:46,469
traveling from Serbia to America

2035
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:48,630
and something interesting happened my

2036
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:51,810
luggage didn't come with my on my flight

2037
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:54,930
somehow I managed to pause the the guy

2038
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:57,060
who checked my passport but now after

2039
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:59,880
that I come to the customs and I'm

2040
01:23:57,060 --> 01:24:01,740
coming to them and saying my luggage is

2041
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:05,130
lost I don't have anything and they say

2042
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:07,400
go over there and fill the form I filled

2043
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:07,400
it and

2044
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:17,040
they do me that I think I will have

2045
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:29,060
it's food so when I've come back into

2046
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:29,059
the car my luck

2047
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:34,580
it's to Ron

2048
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:41,050
great

2049
01:24:43,130 --> 01:24:47,350
they have a

2050
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:50,370
difficult

2051
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:50,370
coming into the country

2052
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:55,160
look

2053
01:24:56,659 --> 01:25:01,570
there are times in question

2054
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:08,539
so right now I think they probably

2055
01:25:15,690 --> 01:25:25,730
chances are pretty good together so

2056
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:36,530
Dulles this is the quarantine

2057
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:36,530
you

2058
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:41,459
port and frustrating

2059
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:45,019
people

2060
01:25:41,459 --> 01:25:45,019
then bring drugs in

2061
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:59,269
the one of these that I've seen they

2062
01:25:56,910 --> 01:26:01,710
have dogs trained to sniff for money

2063
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:03,090
so I think they don't care about drugs

2064
01:26:01,710 --> 01:26:07,260
or food as much as they care about

2065
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:10,950
bricks of US cash so you know it depends

2066
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:12,870
on the nation's threat model too yet so

2067
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:16,110
you mentioned about mailing your own

2068
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:18,000
phone to yourself with a Pakistani guy

2069
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:21,030
or what was it the Palestinian yeah

2070
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:24,360
listenin yeah so how much can they

2071
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:26,759
search the the postal packages they can

2072
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:30,330
search it a lot I mean but they also

2073
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:31,620
it's a it's a there's a lot of mail so

2074
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:33,960
it's difficult so you know most of the

2075
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:35,730
way that's but personal quantities of

2076
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:38,250
drugs come into the United States is

2077
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:44,759
through the mail system US Mail and

2078
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:48,920
FedEx the US Mail is an interesting case

2079
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:51,000
because it's federally protected as

2080
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:53,430
private so they're not allowed to open

2081
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,540
it without filing warrants and stuff

2082
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:57,750
like that but they're allowed to x-ray

2083
01:26:54,540 --> 01:27:02,160
it so suspect packages tend to get

2084
01:26:57,750 --> 01:27:03,420
x-rayed but lots of packages come into

2085
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,559
the country all the time and a lot of

2086
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:06,570
them have electronics or whatever in

2087
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:08,520
them and it's just like you know it's

2088
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:11,309
just relatively easy to smuggle things

2089
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:13,530
in in the mail if it doesn't look over

2090
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:15,420
at least suspicious a phone in a FedEx

2091
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:17,700
package it's not gonna look suspicious

2092
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:19,430
because I mean like a view or a laptop

2093
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:21,510
like if you order a laptop from Apple

2094
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:25,920
online that's how it comes to you it

2095
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:27,210
comes in a box from China so you know

2096
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,640
your chances your chances are pretty

2097
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:31,140
good that it'll get through and Bruce

2098
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:33,480
Schneier has done some writing on the

2099
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:35,660
border problem too like if you want to

2100
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:38,309
carry your laptop but you don't want to

2101
01:27:35,660 --> 01:27:41,700
be forced to have it searched you know

2102
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:44,370
he's his suggestion is you encrypt it

2103
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:47,880
with a key that you don't know and then

2104
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:49,500
you mail the key to yourself in the

2105
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:51,330
destination country and then send of the

2106
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,070
border they say unlock your device and

2107
01:27:51,330 --> 01:27:55,260
you say I can't

2108
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:57,710
and then they'll confiscate the device

2109
01:27:55,260 --> 01:28:00,560
but you know

2110
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:02,720
but that works you know if you're a

2111
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:04,850
citizen but you know if you're a if

2112
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:06,950
you're someone who you think is gonna

2113
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:10,190
they're gonna look askance at you right

2114
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:11,090
like especially in America right now as

2115
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:13,730
a Muslim because they have this

2116
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:15,050
quote-unquote Muslim ban and you say oh

2117
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:17,000
I've got this laptop but I don't know

2118
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:19,220
how to unlock it they're probably just

2119
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,870
gonna say you like cuz they have a

2120
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:22,970
complete license to with you

2121
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:25,640
there's a great story on the intercept I

2122
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:27,290
recommend reading it from earlier this

2123
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:29,660
year where an American citizen

2124
01:28:27,290 --> 01:28:32,240
journalist was in Mexico and he came

2125
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:33,830
back and the customs guy said what story

2126
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:35,269
were you working on and he's a

2127
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:36,769
journalist and he's like I don't have to

2128
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:38,090
tell you what story I'm working on so he

2129
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:40,580
just said well god I was just like

2130
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:43,640
evaluating the guacamole at restaurants

2131
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:45,380
in Mexico and that customs agent was

2132
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:47,390
just like oh you think you're funny all

2133
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:48,890
right I'm gonna keep you here all day

2134
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:50,420
I'm gonna make you unlock your devices

2135
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:51,950
and he went through absolutely

2136
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:54,260
everything on this guy's devices for an

2137
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:55,670
entire day read every single email every

2138
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:58,340
single text message looked at every

2139
01:28:55,670 --> 01:29:02,810
photo on his computer because he can you

2140
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:05,480
know so there's like various ways that

2141
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:07,880
you can like make your device not get

2142
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:09,379
unlocked you know and you can sort of

2143
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:11,410
say well like the rules are on my say

2144
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:13,760
but the rules are way more on their side

2145
01:29:11,410 --> 01:29:14,809
if they can stop becoming in the country

2146
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,000
if you're a citizen it's fine but if

2147
01:29:14,810 --> 01:29:18,200
you're not they can just they can just

2148
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,780
put you on a plane for any reason they

2149
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:24,650
want to so the best thing to do is not

2150
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:26,630
stand out and so if you think you might

2151
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:27,889
get targeted if you've mailed your phone

2152
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:29,750
if it's encrypted it doesn't matter

2153
01:29:27,890 --> 01:29:32,390
really if it gets intercepted on the way

2154
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:34,670
you can if you want be super paranoid

2155
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:37,580
and you can paint glitter polish on the

2156
01:29:34,670 --> 01:29:40,340
seams and detective it's been opened you

2157
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:41,960
know all that kind of stuff but most

2158
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:43,280
likely it's gonna get through in the

2159
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,750
mail just fine unless you're already

2160
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:47,900
someone that's on like a foreign

2161
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:49,640
intelligence watchlist and then you've

2162
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:51,440
got some just stupid phone at the border

2163
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:54,160
that you can unlock for them it's

2164
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,160
probably going to be fine

2165
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:02,090
I'm sorry but we don't have any more

2166
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:05,390
time for questions we nominate all we

2167
01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:08,760
can say we can get other beers whenever

2168
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:11,839
we want to thank you sauce

2169
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:11,839
[Music]

2170
