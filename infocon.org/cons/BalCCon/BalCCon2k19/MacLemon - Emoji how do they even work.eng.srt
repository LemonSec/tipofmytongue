2
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:38,900
the do they work and you should be

3
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:41,059
afraid of them thank you okay thank you

4
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:44,089
see it seems that I have a reputation to

5
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:46,820
meet now that means no pressure

6
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,790

me I'm Mike lemon you can find me on

8
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,900
these interweb thingies some of the most

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,419
comfy instance of the fairy birds

10
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,550
available I'm still somewhere on Twitter

11
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,960
it's intentionally not readable because

12
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,059
I really look into it

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,150
England fairy Wars or somewhere else you

14
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:08,149
can find me if you want to use these

15
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:11,659
social media things about my talk please

16
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:15,620
use the Balcom hashtag and mot what the

17
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:18,350
 that will work and we'll be having

18
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:21,890
a look at emoji and how do they actually

19
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:24,979
work so quick question raise of hands

20
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:28,150
who thinks that the the things with

21
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:33,350
emoji started about ten years ago and

22
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:37,540
there's one into me okay that's a very

23
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,539
very few hands twenty years ago

24
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:45,539
still very very few hands okay

25
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,540
fifty

26
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:53,869
like okay few more century ago

27
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:58,460
okay everybody is laughing no hands

28
00:01:53,869 --> 00:02:00,320
anymore more than a century one hand two

29
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:06,408
three you'll be in for a surprise

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:09,250
okay yeah at that's time when these

31
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:13,970
multi things started the Sun was shining

32
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:16,400
and will shine some light on that

33
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,870
question now like three thousand six

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,030
hundred seventy years ago before f40

35
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:27,080
being IT people we use a proper point of

36
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,790
zero which is a port of course the Sun

37
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,720
was shining at the land of the he

38
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:36,530
titties that is roughly where turkey is

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:41,090
now so this is a rough map of back then

40
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:43,550
in the time to the left hand corner you

41
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,470
have the blue thing is the sea that's

42
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,239
water okay you with me

43
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,180
let's the Mediterranean Sea on the upper

44
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:55,160
right hand corner you have the Black Sea

45
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,840
and this alla Xia Island is now called

46
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,850
Cyprus so that we have a rough

47
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:07,670
orientation where we are and in the city

48
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:11,390
of karkemish drinks were stored in in

49
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:13,850
clay jugs empty cans like ground chuck

50
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:21,458
with a wood handle that wood rings him

51
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:25,160
and this chart was found unearthed

52
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:29,359
rebuilt and they found a smiley face on

53
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,829
it and scientifically we can actually

54
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:33,140
prove it it's actually a smiley because

55
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:36,019
there's no other markings drawings or

56
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,578
anything on this one or any other jug so

57
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,060
this is probably one of the oldest

58
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:42,320
smiley faces ever reproduced in the

59
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,230
world

60
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,739
this was unearthed by people in

61
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:50,238
University of Bologna and this

62
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:53,989
particular chart was used for sherbet

63
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,290
which is a sweet lemonade drink so

64
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,450
people are happy with sweet things fast

65
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,329
forward

66
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:03,459
to two hundred twenty nine years before

67
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,160
that's like fast-forward three thousand

68
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,190
four hundred years in a city in Slovakia

69
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:13,030
a signature was found in a book about

70
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,650
the city treasury and that someone was

71
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,930
really satisfied with the results so

72
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,690
they make a smiley face in the Treasury

73
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:23,170
books I will not pronounce try to

74
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:27,219
pronounce that proper name of an abbot

75
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:28,900
and notary in a sisters in closer I'll

76
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,180
probably totally immerse myself so I'll

77
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,909
spare you that I come up to me if you

78
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,760
actually want to know who that was ten

79
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,970
years before a park getting closer to

80
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,610
our IT reference of zero people began to

81
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,760
work on asking the American standard for

82
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,650
information interchange so we're getting

83
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,140
to modern times so let's move our

84
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,429
timescale a little you have the zero on

85
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,270
the right hand side we'll just move that

86
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:58,600
to the left and events are coming a lot

87
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:01,599
denser now in the 70s we have the

88
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,160
plateau for which is a computer system

89
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,810
it was used to view microfiche archives

90
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,000
probably many of you have no idea what a

91
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,410
microfiche is it's not related to fish

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,670
like animals and basically a fish is a

93
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:21,010
piece of analog film and you basically

94
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:24,190
take a photo of a newspaper or a

95
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:26,349
document and put it on a film and

96
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,990
because film is very reliable as a long

97
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,880
storage long term medium for storage and

98
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,940
also very high resolution so you can

99
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,080
really reproduce fine details in a very

100
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:40,930
small scale and this device was used to

101
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,419
view these things that's a plateau v

102
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,210
it's I could not get a free picture of a

103
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:49,410
plateau for it had a transparent plasma

104
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:52,570
display 512 pixels squared resolution

105
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:55,270
touchscreen programmable graphics fonts

106
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:58,150
a back projection for this film

107
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:01,690
microfiche viewing a voice synthesizer

108
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:04,750
audio recording audio playback a four

109
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:08,500
voice music synthesizer and that was in

110
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,430
the 70s that was really really really

111
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,310
ahead of it

112
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:16,960
I'm back then and what else was there on

113
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:19,330
this particular machine these things it

114
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,520
was possible to print characters over

115
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,310
each other like if he is a typewriter

116
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,990
printing type of character go back one

117
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,780
character type another one it lands on

118
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,790
top of it and with that machine it was

119
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:34,570
possible to do that on screen and on

120
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:36,400
print and by typing weird sequences of

121
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:38,980
characters you could actually make the

122
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,900
pixels line up to build up a smiley like

123
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:45,850
this Viktor or objects or Victorina

124
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,979
Smiley's and people were using that and

125
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:52,180
sharing like oh you need to this this

126
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:53,680
sequence to get the smile and yeah

127
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,360
thanks to Brian deer for sending me

128
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:02,350
these natural 70 screenshots wonderful

129
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:06,670
and in the early 80s we have a person

130
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:14,080
named Scott Fahlman he proposed using :

131
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:16,480
- closing race to mark ironic postings

132
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,950
in a scientific context because it was

133
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,010
the Carnegie Mellon University in the

134
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:24,610
United States he also proposed for

135
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:27,820
things that were too close to reality to

136
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:31,360
make a frowning smiley the frowny was

137
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,840
invented so yeah we have emoticons isn't

138
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,560
it wonderful

139
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,289
we have emoticons yeah and these tilted

140
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,920
to the left side faces they're called

141
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:43,900
the so-called western style emoticons in

142
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,360
the southern hemisphere so if you're

143
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:49,320
from Australia or New Zealand you might

144
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,320
see them the other way around

145
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:59,830
yep so shadow to our Aussie friends what

146
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:02,160
else happened in 1982 any ideas shout it

147
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,159
out to me

148
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:09,930
emoticons huh what was have you attended

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:17,080
my last year's talk probably not

150
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:20,350
email SMTP and message format RFC 81 821

151
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,330
and 822 they were invented in 1982 as

152
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:25,120
well as oh emails really old if you want

153
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:29,219
to don't get into emails just no don't

154
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,380
come serious there's other emoji

155
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:35,530
especially emoji styles now this is a

156
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:39,280
Japanese style usually the Japanese do

157
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:42,098
emoji up front facing and up right so

158
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:45,520
not tilted and on the side these are

159
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:49,600
called cow Moo G from the Japanese word

160
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,699
cow meaning face and moji meaning a

161
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,970
glyph for character so these are

162
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,890
literally face characters but the pretty

163
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,560
fitting term for what they actually do

164
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:03,550
and these came up in ASCII net in Japan

165
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:06,459
in Japan in around 86 ish then there's

166
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,079
the Korean style interesting thing here

167
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:12,940
is they don't use any ASCII characters

168
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:18,270
anymore but they use Korean characters

169
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:22,150
called llamo and Hangul being the Korean

170
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:23,650
script type and Yama main character in

171
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:27,579
Korean and they look like this for

172
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:30,040
example they had already extended ASCII

173
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,280
characters of course our skis 7-bit and

174
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:37,089
only has 127 characters that's not a lot

175
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:40,630
and they had to use certain encodings to

176
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:42,400
make that work and when it comes to

177
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,910
encoding many people think of this one

178
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:48,760
of course this is absolutely not

179
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,079
possible in ascii if you want to have

180
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,260
the breakdown there's three different

181
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,290
types of parentheses and other

182
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:59,460
characters you actually need a lot more

183
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:01,900
characters to make this string work and

184
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,390
when you have emoji and a lot of them

185
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,280
you need to find the user interface to

186
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,810
pick them so somebody came up with the

187
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:12,250
idea of emoji pickers in 1987

188
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,680
back then they were not really

189
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,360
characters but graphics that were

190
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,888
inserted into messages

191
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:23,799
but it did work you could pick an emoji

192
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:26,350
and attach it to your message this is a

193
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:30,480
string job actually from back then from

194
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:33,670
the cocoanut bulletin board system and

195
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,519
if we want to do that as characters and

196
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:39,128
use more scripts we actually need a way

197
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:45,160
to describe more characters

198
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:48,009
so yeah Unicode came up in 1992 Unicode

199
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,040
is a standard for characters and

200
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:53,499
encoding characters it's brought up by

201
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,209
the Unicode consortium which is a

202
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:58,929
nonprofit organization it relies on

203
00:10:55,209 --> 00:11:04,388
donations so they don't make any money

204
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:08,679
from it and they released Unicode 1.0 in

205
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:12,730
1992 they were already smiley faces in

206
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:14,738
there not a lot exactly three of them

207
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:18,759
which is of course not a lot what we had

208
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:20,559
a frowning face and two different smiley

209
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,389
faces already in these article points

210
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,488
you can see when something interesting

211
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:30,669
happened in Japan of course Japan being

212
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:34,869
wildly crazy from our point of view the

213
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:36,549
J phone appeared J phones a was a

214
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:38,049
Japanese mobile phone carrier back then

215
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:41,049
they brought a phone to market that

216
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:44,860
could display 90 proprietary graphic

217
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:46,629
characters there were already pagers

218
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,730
which are basically if you have never

219
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:50,439
seen what a pager is it's a small

220
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:55,239
electronic device that we can receive

221
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:57,610
either a string of numbers only like a

222
00:11:55,239 --> 00:12:00,879
phone number you had to call back back

223
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:04,119
then or a very short string of text like

224
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:06,579
one-way SMS with no way to reply and

225
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:09,239
that was the future back then so this

226
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:11,199
phone came up with a we could use

227
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:13,329
characters now this of course is

228
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:16,089
Japanese on the screenshot but you can

229
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:20,498
see a whale in there pointing arrow to

230
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:22,779
it let's whale emoji a tiny it's looking

231
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:25,919
towards you with an half open mouth and

232
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:25,919
spewing water

233
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,430
it's a terrific idea but it was only

234
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:34,000
available on this very phone on this

235
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:37,410
single device on one carrier in Japan so

236
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,140
the general impact was rather negligible

237
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:44,350
but the set of emoji characters they

238
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,180
used these are the most important ones

239
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,950
the really important emojis they were

240
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,589
already there that's hard there's

241
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:53,470
different persons of course cats cats

242
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:56,350
are always important no no talk is

243
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,870
complete without cats coffee beer cake

244
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,640
was already a lie back then and of

245
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,740
course everybody's darling pile of poo

246
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,470
was already in that set of characters

247
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:08,980
you can see it in the first row third

248
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:12,190
from the right then in 1999 chic

249
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:14,410
attacker carita he was working with NTT

250
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:19,600
DoCoMo which is a mother Japanese

251
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:22,230
carrier chic otaku Clarita and his team

252
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,430
which consisted of one other person

253
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,589
created a set of symbols which were

254
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,689
rolled out on multiple devices this time

255
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:31,420
he's often credited with having created

256
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,480
the first emoji set which is as we

257
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,849
already know now obviously not true but

258
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,700
he created the first interoperable set

259
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,560
of emojis that was rolled out in Japan

260
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,020
across multiple characters across

261
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,819
multiple phones so people could start

262
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,770
using them actually in everyday life and

263
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:51,820
be sure that the receiving end would

264
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:53,230
have a way to understand that and of

265
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,560
course the Japanese use picks that up

266
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:58,209
pretty quickly and being Japan more and

267
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,319
more people found this useful and of

268
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:04,359
course entertaining around 2000 these

269
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,000
online messenger thingies came up you

270
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,570
maybe remember Microsoft network Amazon

271
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,329
or a.m. or

272
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:15,699
you might have used that one and they

273
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:19,359
started bringing their own graphics set

274
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:23,019
of emojis in and then in 2006 Google

275
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,940
started to put emoji characters into

276
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:27,699
private parts like private set

277
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:30,130
characters into Unicode so they started

278
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:33,069
to standardize this a little and try to

279
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:37,180
do some effort and then it really took

280
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:39,730
off Apple introduced iPhone OS 2.2 with

281
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:42,519
emoji support but only if you

282
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,070
like a Japanese Softbank SIM card and a

283
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:49,060
soft back email account configured which

284
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:52,410
is a ridiculously Apple luckily that

285
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:54,339
nonsense came to end pretty quickly and

286
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,079
they were apps on the App Store

287
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:57,459
available that you could download and

288
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,500
start and they would do some magic to

289
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:02,109
enable the emoji keyboard even if you

290
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,610
had not as Japanese SIM card and people

291
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,339
were actually paying money for this to

292
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:10,570
just just get emoji and with Unicode

293
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:12,250
standard 6.0 up until now the unicode

294
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,949
character standard and the emoji

295
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,269
standard were two different things

296
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:19,029
brought out by the Unicode consortium

297
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:21,820
and with Unicode 6 it was merged to one

298
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:26,699
standard so now emoji are officially

299
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:29,470
part of the Unicode text standard and

300
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:31,810
when Apple came up with iOS 5 and

301
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:34,360
released the emoji keyboard for all

302
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:37,569
iPhones on the planet to use which was

303
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,949
wonderful people were experimenting with

304
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:43,089
that two years later

305
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:45,819
Android came with 4.4 KitKat if you

306
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:49,180
still remember that and they also

307
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:52,810
implemented in 2013 the oxford

308
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:55,388
dictionary thought well let's put emoji

309
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,130
in the official Oxford Dictionary of the

310
00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:01,540
English language so emoji is now

311
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:03,730
officially a word and it's described as

312
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,510
a small digital immature icon used to

313
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:09,819
express an idea or emotion emoji live in

314
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:13,079
of your text messages with tiny smiley

315
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:17,079
faces much pretty accurate description

316
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:20,349
in 2013 also came up the emoji Padian

317
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:25,180
you know Wikipedia you know yeah

318
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:27,550
emoji pedia is just four emoji it's like

319
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,219
an encyclopedia exclusively for

320
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:33,099
everything emoji if you need to look up

321
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:36,810
anything yo you'll find it there then

322
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:40,740
since 2014 we celebrate world emoji day

323
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:46,569
it's a thing it happens on 17th of July

324
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:49,870
Y on 17th of July you can see the answer

325
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:52,060
up there there's the official unicode

326
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:56,410
emoji character for a calendar

327
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:58,060
and it displays a date of July 17th this

328
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:03,250
is why we have this but why is that date

329
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:06,760
on that emoji blame Apple because on

330
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:09,640
17th of July in 2002 Apple released a

331
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,650
calendaring application called iCal and

332
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,260
that was the release state so they had

333
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:16,270
this date on the application icon while

334
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,770
it was not running and the current date

335
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,230
while it was running which confused a

336
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,359
lot of people so they had to fix it but

337
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,819
apples pretty much a reason why we have

338
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:30,070
emoji day on July 17th now every year

339
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:33,600
and 2015 for the first time an emoji was

340
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:37,840
declared world a word of the year so

341
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:40,290
smile face with tears of joy is the

342
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,949
first emoji to become word of the year

343
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:48,370
world one interesting since 2016 you can

344
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:52,900
use emoji as a ad targeting selector on

345
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:56,199
Twitter also in 2016 we had the first

346
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:59,590
emoji con a conference multi day

347
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:02,470
conference about emoji you see this

348
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:06,429
starts to escalate in some way and also

349
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:10,740
the first interoperable emoji set by

350
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:13,780
shiki taka carita from 1997 was

351
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:18,000
exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art's

352
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:21,399
so now emoji are officially art as well

353
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,170
since 2017 you can search for emoji on

354
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,510
Twitter even if you're not doing our

355
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:28,300
head targeting but just as plain user so

356
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:33,490
it's a democratization of emoji search

357
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:36,250
and in 2018 several larger vendors

358
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:39,430
agreed on this depiction of the pistil

359
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:43,990
emoji we'll hear more about that in a

360
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:47,020
moment and now that we have 2019 so what

361
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:51,340
do we do since we're working with

362
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,720
Unicode and stuff we need to have a look

363
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,209
at encoding and how these are

364
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,300
implemented well encoding of course

365
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:00,040
you'll think of this again let's start

366
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,710
simple ASCII the American standard for

367
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:06,220
information interchange

368
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:09,250
was invented for teletype terminals in

369
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:13,150
the 70s 60s 70s they were derived from

370
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:15,730
the from the teleprinter or Telegraph it

371
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:21,310
was seven bits only so it means 2 to the

372
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:23,700
7th 128 characters 1 byte of memory in a

373
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:26,560
computer equals exactly one character

374
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:31,450
that's reasonably simple for a computer

375
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:33,070
to work with the from 0 to 31

376
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,370
you have control characters like a

377
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:38,530
carriage return line feed escape the

378
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,149
bell character it's what makes your

379
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:44,440
terminal beep when you press tab to

380
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:46,210
autocomplete control sequences like

381
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,280
moving your cursor they are not part of

382
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:53,740
a ski but letters printable characters

383
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,830
a-to-z math functions like plus/minus

384
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:58,900
division multiplication they are but no

385
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,429
accented characters like we use in

386
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,330
Serbian for example there's a lot of

387
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:06,460
accented characters so if we take the

388
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,070
text string bow hunt words out on here

389
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,690
so we'll use that as a example and use

390
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,610
the bit representation for those

391
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:15,520
characters in ASCII in you see it in

392
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:17,219
binary in decimal in hex just ignore the

393
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,889
lower two lines see look at the binary

394
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:24,070
they all start with 0 the first bit is

395
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:28,660
always a zero because we only use 7 of

396
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:31,929
those 8 bits but in 7 bits we can barely

397
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,900
fit enough characters to type any text

398
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:37,120
even if it's only latin characters so we

399
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,820
need a lot more and if you want to have

400
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,889
a look at your complete ASCII table just

401
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,200
get out your computer pretty much any

402
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:48,010
modern operating system has a man page

403
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:50,470
for ASCII on any bsd or linux or mac and

404
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:55,210
you can look at that table so what do we

405
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:59,860
do with those remaining bit characters

406
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:02,110
from 128 to 255 well you can use those

407
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:05,590
it's called extended ASCII and this

408
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:08,590
upper half can be localized to represent

409
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:11,620
for example accented characters like

410
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:15,850
there is in French or hot chicks like in

411
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:18,929
Serbian or other characters but do not

412
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:21,850
fit the very simple Latin alphabet of

413
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:24,010
course you have to somehow declare which

414
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:26,889
characters are presented there because

415
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:29,650
you only have a limited space and some

416
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:32,200
other alphabet like Greek would use

417
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:34,750
different characters so how do you get

418
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,930
by well it's called encoding and it

419
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:42,910
describes what how to understand this

420
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:45,280
upper half of the encoding interesting

421
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:48,820
enough there are several hundred code

422
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,970
pages different code pages that make use

423
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:54,370
of those remaining bits and some

424
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,830
encodings differ by only eight

425
00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:03,129
characters you might have heard of iso

426
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:09,220
8859-1 it's also called latin one you

427
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:11,680
may have heard of ISO 8859 - 15 it

428
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,840
differs by exactly eight characters the

429
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:17,320
major difference being they added as a

430
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:21,010
currency symbol for the Euro this is why

431
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:25,000
if you want to put up a euro somewhere

432
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:26,560
you need the different encoding so if

433
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,240
you have different encodings sometimes

434
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,770
you need to translate from one to the

435
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,480
other this is a really really

436
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:36,220
non-trivial exercise and it's that kind

437
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,230
of non-trivial there's even a special

438
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:41,920
word for when you make mistakes in

439
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:45,010
translating like from one code page to

440
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:48,550
another and you get the wrong one that

441
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:50,050
word is multi pocket it's Japanese we

442
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:54,340
already know the word emoji

443
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:56,850
it means character and baka is a

444
00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:00,939
Japanese verdict derive zanpakuto and

445
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:03,370
that means to change something with the

446
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:06,700
implicit meaning of changing it not for

447
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:09,790
the better so you're changing something

448
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:12,240
for the worse so much ibaka means yeah

449
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:17,560
pretty much exactly what results from

450
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:20,740
mistranslating stuff and you can do that

451
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:23,740
with multiple mistakes and end up with

452
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,170
terrible things in text if you ever had

453
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,660
to migrate a mailing list from mailman

454
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,080
to to mailman three you'll run into

455
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,500
those

456
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:35,220
problems in German I noticed many of you

457
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,480
are speaking a little German at least

458
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:41,380
there's this funny thing it's called

459
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:47,440
chess encoding of course it means

460
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:51,400
encoding that s is a sharp s already an

461
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,950
extended character for asking so you

462
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,370
need proper encoding for for that word

463
00:23:53,950 --> 00:24:01,900
to work if it doesn't work you may have

464
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:03,790
seen people wearing this t-shirt because

465
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:07,330
some thing with the encoding went wrong

466
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:09,280
now this is not possible in ASCII you

467
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,050
need unicode to represent that special

468
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,840
character it's called the replacement

469
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:15,850
character so there even is a character

470
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,000
to okay I have no idea what this is

471
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:22,000
let's put this into designate I have no

472
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,490
idea what it is so what do we do can't

473
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,550
we find a standard - that works for

474
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,350
everything you know standards there's so

475
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,879
many to choose from

476
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:33,760
yep let's invent one that works for

477
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,650
everything that has proven to work what

478
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,440
actually does work it's called UTF the

479
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:42,390
Unicode transformation format and it

480
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:45,130
comes in three flavors utf-8 16 and 32

481
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:47,350
utf-8 is an encoding method with a

482
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,450
variable length so a character can be

483
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:55,570
either one byte in memory - three or

484
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:59,560
four utf-16 is either 2 or 4 bytes and

485
00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:02,740
utf-32 is always 4 bytes but if you

486
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:05,169
don't need all those 4 bytes is wasteful

487
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:07,690
so you need a loves memory or storage

488
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,670
space that is unused so utf-8 is

489
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:12,090
actually what you want to use it's a

490
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:15,850
very versatile format it delivers over

491
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:18,280
90% of the world's webpages and the

492
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:20,560
second most used is jiff cheese which is

493
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,920
a Japanese format and if that is less

494
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:26,290
than 1% already so utf-8 is really the

495
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,720
dominant encoding format these days and

496
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:31,360
it's what you want to use how does it

497
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,270
work with multiple bytes I mean how do I

498
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,669
know if I using one or two or three it's

499
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:39,220
quite nifty it's a surprisingly simple

500
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:41,580
solution if we look at that code point

501
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:46,919
that's what power unicode characters are

502
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:49,350
categorized the first 127 characters the

503
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:50,190
first bit in memory is a zero like in

504
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:53,908
ASCII so

505
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:55,980
utf-8 is 100% identical to ASCII for

506
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:57,869
those first characters which is great

507
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:02,009
because it means backward compatibility

508
00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:05,939
it's easy to use it also means if we

509
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:08,759
make that first bit of one instead of a

510
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,259
zero we have a flag that tells us wait

511
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:13,859
there's something different coming up

512
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:16,200
you need to pay attention and for a

513
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:18,210
2-byte character we start with the one

514
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,889
on the leading bite telling you hey pay

515
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:23,399
attention there's something different we

516
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:25,799
put in another one meaning one another

517
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:28,619
one that's two ones now we have a two

518
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:31,080
pipe character and since binary has this

519
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:32,999
wonderful thing of another character

520
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,939
called zero we have a way to terminate

521
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:38,700
the series of ones that we send so one

522
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,909
one zero means two bytes and now we

523
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,769
start with the next thing three bytes

524
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:46,590
you can already imagine how this works

525
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:48,529
you have one one one zero now you know

526
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:52,109
it's three bytes so you use the rest up

527
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:54,899
for your remaining data that you need to

528
00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:57,749
convey and every subsequent bye it

529
00:26:54,899 --> 00:27:00,268
starts with a one and an immediate zero

530
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:02,249
so you know it cannot be a living byte

531
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:06,690
because the first one always has at

532
00:27:02,249 --> 00:27:09,570
least two ones so if you find the byte

533
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:11,549
sequence it's clear if you're on a

534
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,859
leading byte or if you're on a

535
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:15,809
subsequent one so you can easily

536
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:20,070
synchronize to where does a character

537
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:23,428
start because it's totally easy to find

538
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:26,609
and four characters they work just the

539
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:30,149
same one important takeaway here is all

540
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:32,639
emoji of four byte characters of course

541
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:34,949
the codings and you tff being a

542
00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:36,418
universal encoding encoding zli to

543
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,879
problems that's just the nature of

544
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:43,350
encodings you might have worked with

545
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:45,359
databases like mysql or mariadb it comes

546
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:49,168
with an encoding or collation mean

547
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:52,859
sorting order called utf-8 I put that in

548
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:53,670
quotes because that utf-8 as they call

549
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:56,189
it only does

550
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:58,170
three byte sequences meaning if you want

551
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,570
to put a comment on that WordPress blog

552
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,770
with an emoji it does not work I mean

553
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:05,159
you can send it but it doesn't get

554
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:09,990
stored properly in the database this is

555
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:13,020
why in 2015 MySQL added an encoding

556
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:15,150
called utf-8 multibyte for so now you

557
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,680
can represent emoji in the database for

558
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:20,760
your postings or comments

559
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:22,410
luckily the MySQL installer now defaults

560
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,720
to using that but if you have an older

561
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:28,350
blog you need to convert that have fun

562
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,020
with that of course WordPress being

563
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:33,060
written in a language called PHP PHP

564
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,670
only can work with eight byte characters

565
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:39,330
yes it's 2019 if you want to check your

566
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:40,530
calendar what if you want to use more

567
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,290
than this archaic

568
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:47,010
set well there's the multipied string

569
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:51,110
PHP module extension and unless you load

570
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,110
that you cannot do anything but it's

571
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:58,260
that extension is available since PHP

572
00:28:54,270 --> 00:29:00,210
for point 0.6 of course you have all

573
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,040
your applications updated to seven point

574
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:04,470
two which is the current supported

575
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,270
version I'm pretty sure you don't have

576
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,870
any legacy code around monie anymore

577
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:12,080
it's also not security supported so

578
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:15,780
there's really no excuse to not use that

579
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:20,699
if you use JavaScript it uses 16-bit

580
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:23,490
so-called code units meaning every

581
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,290
characters at least 16 bits and if it

582
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,290
does not fit in there you use just two

583
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:30,180
of those 16-bit code units it's kind of

584
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,080
wasteful but it's safe to use with emoji

585
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:35,190
that's fine

586
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:40,050
if you do Java it also uses 16-bit code

587
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:42,240
units but they can only use one code

588
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:45,120
unit with 16 bits to encode a character

589
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,360
not too so no emoji in Java I'm sorry

590
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,629
there's a separate library called emoji

591
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:54,540
Java if you need emoji in your

592
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:56,520
enterprise applications Python 3 all the

593
00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:01,320
strings of utf-8 and is fully supported

594
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:04,889
so that's fine if you're using rust it

595
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,439
gets more complex you can use it in

596
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,389
strings that's fine if

597
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,549
you want to use it as identifiers for

598
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:12,709
your variables you can only use two byte

599
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:16,940
Unicode characters so no emoji as

600
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:19,759
variables in rust Catalan is pretty much

601
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:23,059
the same if you go for gold line

602
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:25,730
the Google language to byte Unicode

603
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:28,519
characters in identifiers yes you can do

604
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:31,490
that but only if they start with an

605
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:33,529
ASCII character whyever that is but if

606
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:37,549
you need to use model-view-controller in

607
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:40,730
chinese this is how you do it I will not

608
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:42,740
try to pronounce the Chinese Swift being

609
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:46,159
a quite modern language invented by

610
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:48,289
Apple it's used for iPhones and Mac's to

611
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,049
program applications it does fully

612
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:55,820
support emoji what does full support

613
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:57,799
mean you can write code like that I mean

614
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:02,870
who doesn't want hearts and swirls in

615
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:04,908
their code is wonderful what is that is

616
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:11,239
still not enough for your emoji

617
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:14,929
programming needs use emoji code it is

618
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:17,179
the most emoji compatible programming

619
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:22,669
language is open source language and

620
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:25,669
it's written exclusively in emoji it

621
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:29,330
does support ascii legacy characters in

622
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:31,429
streams but not for identifiers so it's

623
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:35,149
pretty much your emoji singularity for

624
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:37,899
programming code let's have a look at

625
00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:42,529
implementations how does how does

626
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:46,370
Unicode implement emoji in in the

627
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:49,250
encoding standard for unicode for each

628
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:51,199
character you have a code point that

629
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:55,279
uniquely identifies the character it's

630
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:58,220
you plus and then a number and you have

631
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:01,909
utf-8 byte sequence that you can use to

632
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:04,190
encode that character for example here's

633
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:08,620
an example a hamster face not the

634
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:11,000
hamster dance if you remember that but

635
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:13,879
people want to talk about more than

636
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,960
hamsters so with persons it already gets

637
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:17,030
more complex

638
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,340
you have noticed maybe on your phone

639
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:24,200
there's person emojis like Smiley's and

640
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:27,560
people and they're totally yellow you

641
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:30,020
might you might think yes that's where

642
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:33,080
we're going to most people do not look

643
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:34,400
like Lego figures you might have noticed

644
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,129
that when working around here they're

645
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:40,430
not yellow in their face so something's

646
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:41,810
not right with your keyboard this is

647
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:46,190
where you can start combining multiple

648
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:48,889
emojis there's something called a skin

649
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:52,850
tone modifier which means you can take

650
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:54,850
emotive a person emoji add a second

651
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:57,889
emoji which is a skin tone modifier and

652
00:32:54,850 --> 00:33:01,340
you get a person with a different skin

653
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:04,400
color so you can represent all people in

654
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:07,070
the world that's a great thing now

655
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,800
nobody's exclusive exclude it anymore I

656
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,610
mean the world's not Lego figures but

657
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,470
you still can

658
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:17,389
you don't even exclude like a fit you

659
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:21,200
can you can use those for everyone it's

660
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:24,080
a two code point sequence you have the

661
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,970
person emoji and the modifier and if

662
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,159
your font understands how to use those

663
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:31,100
it will combine them into a single face

664
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,950
with that skin color that's great

665
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,199
it ends up with emoji being for white

666
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,880
characters for bytes for the person for

667
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,380
bytes for the skin color so you have an

668
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,870
eight byte sequence for a single

669
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:45,290
character now it's vastly different from

670
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:47,510
ASCII if you remember and of course

671
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,730
there's a standardized scale it's called

672
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:52,280
the Fitzpatrick scale it's named after

673
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:56,780
the person Thomas B Fitzpatrick who

674
00:33:52,280 --> 00:34:03,080
invented that scale to standardize the

675
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:05,960
expression of human skin colors and such

676
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:09,920
a modifier always alters the appearance

677
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,960
of the character that came before it so

678
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:15,560
the modifier always works to the left

679
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,990
hand side sadly these skin tone

680
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,150
modifiers can only be applied to person

681
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:24,080
emojis of course it would be nice to

682
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:25,550
like have them work with coffee some

683
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,199
people like their coffee black some

684
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,700
people like their coffee lighter with

685
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:32,868
milk

686
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:37,250
or beer there's different types of beers

687
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:42,409
you could it toast what totally makes

688
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:44,869
sense sorry they don't work it's it's

689
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:47,030
tragic but yeah you can only use skin

690
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:49,700
tone modifiers with toast they also

691
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:53,629
don't work with milk the milk could have

692
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:56,480
in theory some skin but no they don't

693
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:58,730
doubt you may also have seen there's

694
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,579
flax there's a lot of flags and emoji

695
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:06,109
that's probably even multiple pages of

696
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:10,550
flags like the checkered flag it's

697
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:12,619
usually waved when you end a race so now

698
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:15,320
we have a goal to reach that is

699
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:20,390
understand how flags a unit hold work

700
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:22,940
they are very nifty two examples I

701
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:25,819
traveled to here from a country called

702
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:29,420
Austria yesterday and we're here in

703
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:30,829
república sort of young and these are

704
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,290
the two flags for these national

705
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:36,319
countries of course the Unicode standard

706
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:39,290
being very thoughtful wants to have

707
00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:44,420
implement flags in a way that is future

708
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:46,940
proof so countries come and go

709
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,740
some countries disappear they get split

710
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,630
up into other countries into multiple

711
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:54,078
countries how do you make a standard

712
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:58,490
that works for countries that do not

713
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:01,190
exist yet not real problem but they

714
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:04,310
found a very interesting way there's an

715
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:05,450
iso standard which gives every country a

716
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:10,490
two-character

717
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:13,480
shortcut its iso 3166 - one that's not

718
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:16,490
really important but it designates the

719
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:20,420
characters RS for república serbia and

720
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:23,810
80 for Austria now we have a simple

721
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:26,270
identifier and when a new country comes

722
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:31,359
up we can just take two more characters

723
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:34,280
and the unicode standard has the special

724
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:36,410
set it's called the regional indicator

725
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,240
symbols they usually look like a

726
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:40,310
character with a dashed outline like box

727
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,299
around them and if you type those

728
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:44,840
characters

729
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:46,520
in succession your font will say oh well

730
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,570
that's a regional indicator are a

731
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,420
regional indicator

732
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:53,110
si no RS is Silvia I need to replace

733
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,830
that with flag your font will start

734
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,840
putting away those characters and

735
00:36:54,830 --> 00:37:00,529
putting a flag up you don't want to know

736
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:02,210
how long I set to make my slides display

737
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:05,090
those characters without making it like

738
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:07,430
I don't have hit just those so that I

739
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:09,410
could show you but this works for

740
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:11,660
countries non-existing so you just need

741
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:13,640
an update to your font but not an update

742
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:16,009
to the standard so this is a

743
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:20,950
future-proof it's very nifty there's a

744
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:23,630
few flags for not really countries but

745
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:25,910
geopolitical it makes sense to have a

746
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:28,070
flag for the European Union and if you

747
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:32,480
use the regional indicator symbols even

748
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:35,840
you for you you get a European flag nice

749
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,610
thing there's a few more but you can

750
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,410
look that up yourselves or find things

751
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:42,350
on your keyboard you might find Scottish

752
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:45,230
things as well there's more flags like

753
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:48,290
this one I've written the code points

754
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:51,790
beneath it it's a flag it's for Unicode

755
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:56,450
code points but it's just one character

756
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:59,740
so why is that I adds up to actually 14

757
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:01,759
bytes of UTF sequence month lag 14 bytes

758
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:04,910
why is that so complex

759
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:08,240
well let's decompose that flag and see

760
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:11,060
how it's actually built there's a

761
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,850
there's a character for a white flag

762
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,920
it's just a plain white flag then

763
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:22,610
there's some magic and there's a rainbow

764
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:25,340
and the you +200 de it's called a hero

765
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:28,250
with Joyner it's a character that has no

766
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:31,690
width and it joins the characters left

767
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:34,400
and right to it to one it combines those

768
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:35,900
so that's the magic it combines a white

769
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,410
flag with a rainbow and you end up with

770
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,410
a rainbow flag

771
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:46,250
and the white flag itself already

772
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,740
consists of two coat points

773
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,840
so now you know many flags can be

774
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:53,859
combined like that the white flag itself

775
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:56,900
is already too cold points why is that

776
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:59,660
white flag well it's there multiple

777
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:01,700
white flags I mean how much artistic

778
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:05,770
impression can you build into a white

779
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:08,779
flag not a lot more than you think

780
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:11,930
there's a white flag text character

781
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:15,620
which is not an emoji that's really a

782
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:18,080
text character but there is a white flag

783
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:21,589
emoji characters as a character as well

784
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,540
and that other modifier tells your font

785
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:25,400
please do not use the text

786
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:28,460
representation but use the emoji

787
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:32,120
representation it's called the variation

788
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:34,640
selector 16 with a wonderful name and it

789
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:39,319
tells your font to that last character

790
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:41,720
please make it an emoji same way you can

791
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,850
put up a skull and crossbones pirate

792
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:46,609
flag you just start with the black flag

793
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:48,380
and skull and crossbones and skull and

794
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:51,140
crossbones actually exists as a text

795
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:53,720
character and as an emoji and you use

796
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:57,259
the variation selector 16 to tell your

797
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,970
font which one to use okay so no now we

798
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:01,760
can build pretty much any flag in the

799
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:04,580
Unicode standard with emojis what else

800
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:09,590
is there who has a modern phone like

801
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:14,259
last two or three years or so you might

802
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:17,660
have see there's gender modifiers okay

803
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:20,570
have you seen vampires I mean not the

804
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:25,040
movie but an actual vampire the rafter

805
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:27,710
are cool one with a key okay you can

806
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:31,850
take Dracula the Dracula there is a

807
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:33,950
Dracula emoji to start with and but the

808
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:35,920
other one that's not Dracula Dracula is

809
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:39,770
a male person and the other one is

810
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,080
clearly a more female person so how do

811
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:44,360
we get there we already heard the 0 with

812
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:48,500
joiner that combines two characters

813
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:50,660
together well this is what we do here we

814
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,240
take the emoji for Dracula the emoji for

815
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:57,020
female and voila

816
00:40:53,240 --> 00:41:00,290
you have Buffy the Vampire Slayer isn't

817
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,270
that great I mean you can represent more

818
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:05,150
people in the world I mean pretty much

819
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:07,430
exactly 50% more people of the world Oh

820
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:10,550
actually hundred percent more because

821
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:14,419
maybe yeah it's important everyone

822
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:16,880
should be able to use emoji what about

823
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:23,210
those Fitzpatrick's skin tone modifiers

824
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:26,090
now yes we can adjust the paleness of

825
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:28,490
our vampire by using a skin tone

826
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:32,030
modifier and make the more pale or more

827
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:33,830
black so emojis really versatile in

828
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:37,820
combining and allowing for many many

829
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:40,910
things because people want to express

830
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:43,940
many things people are diverse in the

831
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:47,029
world and Unicode standard wants to

832
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:51,800
enable all people to be represented by

833
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:53,390
emoji it's an important thing the zero

834
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,010
with Jonah can be used with multiple

835
00:41:53,390 --> 00:42:00,980
person emojis to represent a family of

836
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:04,670
course there are certain things and

837
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:07,040
brain constructions that states think

838
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:09,740
what a family should look like but the

839
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,200
reality is families can be very

840
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:16,490
different but they are a family and no

841
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:18,919
family is illegal so Unicode can show

842
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:25,729
all families that you can think of and

843
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:27,950
that represents your family yes that is

844
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:29,630
a font limitation technically you can

845
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:31,609
combine more but I don't know of any

846
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:35,540
font that allows for more than two

847
00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:38,180
children in a family and yes you can use

848
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:40,279
skin tone modifies with each of those I

849
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,839
have not made an example that took me

850
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:46,609
already an hour to show that much

851
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:48,410
so our emoji a language we've seen the

852
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:51,049
Moche being used in programming language

853
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:53,270
what about emoji themselves are they a

854
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:55,760
language Trevor Noah

855
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:59,590
who does the daily show called them

856
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,590
contemporary cave drawings

857
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:09,040
it is a multi-language in itself

858
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:11,970
our emoji hieroglyphics hieroglyphics

859
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,130
being a rather unspecific term

860
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:17,560
consisting mostly of pictograms

861
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:19,260
schematic graphics emoji are close but

862
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,930
they are not hieroglyphics

863
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:25,930
because in hieroglyphics a pictogram

864
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:29,230
maps to a very specific term and only to

865
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:32,740
that term so if you take a cow it can

866
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:36,599
only mean cow but people want to talk

867
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:40,000
about more than cows most people do I

868
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,760
mean more than factual cows so imodium

869
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,339
or a meta language they're not a

870
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,980
language in their own but they augment

871
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:50,200
our languages all the languages we speak

872
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:54,339
at last night's karaoke party we had

873
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:58,990
songs in seven languages so emoji no

874
00:43:54,339 --> 00:44:02,890
there was no emoji song but emoji are

875
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:05,649
used in the abstract context of words

876
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:08,470
and extend that context within that

877
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:09,970
context so if you take a cat cat is

878
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:13,990
relatively straightforward as a

879
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:18,759
character but what you want to do with

880
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:22,959
that cat or to that cat it's not really

881
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:25,510
expressed from the emoji itself can be

882
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,660
more calming complex this character in

883
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:31,540
the movie is called tropical drink it

884
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:33,450
might be a tequila sunrise it might be a

885
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:35,859
third Long Island iced tea

886
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:43,000
does that really matter the next morning

887
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:45,098
we don't know or that one when sending

888
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:50,020
this character to an astrophysicist they

889
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:51,670
ask what about that planet other people

890
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,730
will not read a planet into that emoji

891
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:56,440
it's it has a name it's called cookie so

892
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,780
it's a very friendly emoji

893
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,900
it certainly Cookie Monster's favorite

894
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:05,500
character it looks like a chocolate-chip

895
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:10,020
cookie to most people what about that

896
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:13,410
one any ideas what this is cracker

897
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:15,160
you're wrong that is Samsung's

898
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:19,210
interpretation of what a cookie should

899
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:21,609
look like so meaning if you send a

900
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:23,310
message to your friend hey we're

901
00:45:21,609 --> 00:45:26,920
watching movie tonight bring cookies

902
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:28,390
bring emoji cookie and they have a

903
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:32,530
Samsung phone and they brings the wrong

904
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:35,560
snacks to the movie the horror you can't

905
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:38,020
do that I mean you have translation

906
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:42,160
problems now depending on which platform

907
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:46,089
your friends are on like it much it

908
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:48,759
looked different on different phones but

909
00:45:46,089 --> 00:45:50,799
even if the emoji looks the same okay is

910
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,420
your smiling faces in the crowd you know

911
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,970
what I'm up to this is called an

912
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:57,940
eggplant in English in German we usually

913
00:45:54,970 --> 00:46:01,390
say Milan taani or aubergine it's a

914
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:03,670
vegetable it's an edible vegetable it

915
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:07,089
was forbidden to be used as a hashtag on

916
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:09,130
Instagram for someone I don't know why

917
00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:12,490
Instagram discriminates against

918
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:14,320
vegetables it's not really

919
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:16,930
misunderstanding because it clearly is a

920
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:19,390
vegetable unless you put some textual

921
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:22,569
context around it that alters the

922
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:25,990
meaning it's still the same emoji but

923
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:29,619
you can read other things into it sorry

924
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:32,919
you cannot unsee that another one it's a

925
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:35,560
peach it's a fruit it was not banned

926
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,780
from Instagram as a hashtag it's not

927
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:41,740
been censored in the United States these

928
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:42,940
are usually very prone to censoring but

929
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:46,060
they can have different interpretations

930
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:48,620
so a peach is often used as an

931
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:53,029
interpretation for your butt

932
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:53,390
what about that one I already hinted at

933
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:57,230
it

934
00:46:53,390 --> 00:47:01,190
it's called pistol if you know a little

935
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:05,240
bit about guns it looks like a pistol if

936
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:09,520
you receive a message like that hey we

937
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:11,419
see this next weekend and bring them hmm

938
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:15,350
might you be worried when you're

939
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:18,380
receiving such a message maybe the

940
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:21,830
message of friend actually sent look

941
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:25,730
like that and it was an invitation to a

942
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:29,259
garden party bring your water pistol

943
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:34,070
let's have some fun summer outside so

944
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:38,270
you get translation errors from the

945
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:41,030
emoji depending on which iPhone or

946
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:44,630
Android phone or samsung phone or online

947
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:47,570
platform you're working with especially

948
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:50,390
that one is super problematic because

949
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:51,740
I'll show you a few different graphical

950
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:54,580
representations among different

951
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,580
platforms

952
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:02,970
it varies from water pistol toys toy

953
00:48:00,569 --> 00:48:09,359
guns super soaker revolver to space

954
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:11,970
zapper and some company said while we're

955
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:14,328
having a gun promotes violence let let's

956
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:17,308
make it change it to a water pistol

957
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:19,049
while other company said well our space

958
00:48:17,309 --> 00:48:21,000
separate does not really represent

959
00:48:19,049 --> 00:48:23,609
pistol properly let's change it to a

960
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,950
pistol now depending on your version

961
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:28,109
your operating system their vendor and

962
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:30,899
your platform you have multiple ways to

963
00:48:28,109 --> 00:48:32,788
misinterpret that and you have no way to

964
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:35,430
properly convey a message with that

965
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:38,160
emoji so that can be really dangerous

966
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:40,410
well because your invitation to a garden

967
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:45,779
party may lead up to having a SWAT team

968
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:48,690
kicking down your door so that's a

969
00:48:45,779 --> 00:48:52,859
serious problem because emoji are also a

970
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:56,809
mirror of society 70% of emoji used are

971
00:48:52,859 --> 00:49:02,538
usually happy 15% are rather neutral and

972
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:06,089
still 15 emoji 15% of emoji are sad so

973
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:06,569
but we know that not 70% of our life is

974
00:49:06,089 --> 00:49:10,140
happy

975
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:13,410
our online communication is some kind of

976
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:17,368
idealized communication we like to give

977
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:20,970
more of the happy and give less of the

978
00:49:17,369 --> 00:49:24,000
sad away emoji are also stereotypical

979
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:26,399
I'll show you a set of emoji and you

980
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,809
shout out to me where those emoji might

981
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,809
be used most what do you think

982
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:37,679
holidays okay take more of a regional

983
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:37,679
location on the planet

984
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:43,109
waterboarding on Cahokia that's a new

985
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:45,999
one

986
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:47,819
the solution to this is really actually

987
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:50,649
Hawaii

988
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:55,209
yes it's stereotypically of palm trees

989
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:57,509
sunsets tropical drinks surfing what

990
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:57,509
about those

991
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:02,640
hmm okay

992
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:12,609
Lutter any any location you can think of

993
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:12,610
that would somehow match that

994
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:20,570
the solute solution is Lisa Las Vegas

995
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:28,250
Nevada and we all know what happens in

996
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:31,090
Vegas stays in Vegas another one the

997
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:37,700
association is drugs okay that's correct

998
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:40,430
but why and where school Oh interesting

999
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:43,848
okay yeah

1000
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:46,669
a solution to that one is Portugal in

1001
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:49,759
Australia okay

1002
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:54,910
some people have paid attention to drug

1003
00:50:49,759 --> 00:50:58,099
laws in 2011 Portugal started

1004
00:50:54,910 --> 00:51:01,609
decriminalizing all drug possession and

1005
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:05,710
use for recreational use or for medical

1006
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:09,558
use like everything's legal everything

1007
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:14,049
the result of that political decision

1008
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:17,930
was actually less use of drugs less

1009
00:51:14,049 --> 00:51:20,079
abuse of drugs resulting in less people

1010
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:22,700
needing to be treated for drug abuse

1011
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:24,349
with an overall increase in health

1012
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:28,879
across the whole country

1013
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:32,059
of course police forces don't want to

1014
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,710
grab your bag of weed now but can use

1015
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:37,579
their time more properly to fight

1016
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:40,400
corruption and other or other criminal

1017
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:43,849
activities and the health care system

1018
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:47,690
considers a drug addiction like any

1019
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:49,730
other illness and starts treating it the

1020
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:53,329
result is great savings for the taxpayer

1021
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:56,239
a better working health care system in a

1022
00:51:53,329 --> 00:52:00,049
more healthy society just by allowing

1023
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:03,140
that and also that's really really

1024
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:05,089
helpful drug you policy is mirrored in

1025
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:08,690
emoji use because there's more discourse

1026
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:11,029
about drugs people learn more about how

1027
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:14,839
drugs work and what is dangerous to

1028
00:52:11,029 --> 00:52:16,999
their health and what is not so that's a

1029
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:20,019
very important mirror of society that

1030
00:52:16,999 --> 00:52:21,738
you can see in the use of emoji

1031
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:26,229
something different have you heard of

1032
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:30,799
Markov chains yes that's a good answer

1033
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:32,299
Markov chain is a series of characters

1034
00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:35,538
that only go together

1035
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:37,489
all that often go together or series of

1036
00:52:35,539 --> 00:52:40,130
words that often go together you can

1037
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:43,549
have that with emoji like these tears of

1038
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:47,019
joy three times must have been a very

1039
00:52:43,549 --> 00:52:49,910
funny evening they're usually very

1040
00:52:47,019 --> 00:52:52,709
homogeneous like two or three times the

1041
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:54,180
same emoji there's very few that

1042
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:57,030
have a set of different emoji that

1043
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:58,740
always go together like these hear no

1044
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:01,099
evil see no evil speak no evil monkeys

1045
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:03,270
or hearts in different colors and

1046
00:53:01,099 --> 00:53:07,740
depending on how sleepy you are you

1047
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:09,960
might repeat those so how do we

1048
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:11,609
differentiate the language used with

1049
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,859
emoji now let's have a look at it

1050
00:53:11,609 --> 00:53:16,040
there's spoken language that's written

1051
00:53:13,859 --> 00:53:19,279
language and they both come in an

1052
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:23,730
informal way and in the formal way of

1053
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,950
course um a formal spoken conversation

1054
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:29,460
is like having a presentation or speech

1055
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:31,859
radio moderation a written example for

1056
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:34,970
formal language is a book or printed

1057
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:38,009
newspaper or maybe even a blog posting

1058
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:41,040
where the informal language is your

1059
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:43,710
everyday spoken word your local dialect

1060
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:49,079
that you use your local words that are

1061
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:55,130
maybe only known to novice at language

1062
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:58,200
uses intonation gestures grimaces and

1063
00:53:55,130 --> 00:54:00,599
emoji are that representation in a

1064
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:03,180
written context of informal language

1065
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:09,000
they augment that so this is where the

1066
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:13,169
emoji are located and the repetition of

1067
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:15,420
emoji also represents time like if you

1068
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:17,760
had just a funny moment you might have

1069
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,890
won laughing smiley if it was really

1070
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,190
really really funny you might do three

1071
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:25,859
so if you had a longer time of fun you

1072
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:30,000
might use more emoji so in the string of

1073
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:32,339
emoji represents time clapping hands it

1074
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,230
was a clue that was applause one pair of

1075
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:37,440
clapping hands there was a huge ball

1076
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:40,680
three clapping hands so they give a

1077
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:43,349
special and and timely context they're

1078
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:47,609
written motions and written emotions in

1079
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:51,480
time what about things that there are no

1080
00:54:47,609 --> 00:54:53,578
emoji for I mean no emoji I mean are

1081
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:56,059
there things that were that there's no

1082
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:56,059
emoji for

1083
00:54:56,270 --> 00:55:02,280
huh there are things that there's no

1084
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:06,480
emoji for like sex

1085
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:11,099
I mean it's complicated there's also no

1086
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:13,830
emoji for vanilla but humans being

1087
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:16,650
creative beings and emoji being a meta

1088
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:19,799
language depending on the context the

1089
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:24,150
cultural background humans do find ways

1090
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:26,130
to write about sex with emoji you

1091
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:31,260
already know at least two emojis that

1092
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:33,750
you can use and some others I also know

1093
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:36,560
that few of you are for some or many of

1094
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:40,859
you are with an ite or even IT security

1095
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:45,119
do emoji have an IT security relevant

1096
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:53,210
aspect I clean yes and that is a strong

1097
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:59,750
yes there is no emoji for IT security

1098
00:55:53,210 --> 00:56:03,119
but you could make it work in some way

1099
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:07,250
ok it's not officially but it kind of

1100
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,250
fits charge but

1101
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:12,710
what else can be used for emojis you

1102
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:15,230
have may have heard of a messaging

1103
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:19,700
system a network called matrix that's

1104
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:22,520
the riots client for it of is an

1105
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:23,839
end-to-end encrypted messenger and you

1106
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:28,370
know with end-to-end encryption in to

1107
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:30,740
authenticate your your peers and compare

1108
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:33,020
fingerprints like are you letting your

1109
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:36,439
print yes I am I am this give ratio of

1110
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:38,960
hex numbers and Rio uses a funny way

1111
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:41,930
which translate your hex fingerprint

1112
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,490
into a series of emojis that you

1113
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,089
compared if you have the same series of

1114
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:46,220
emojis

1115
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:47,630
we have technically just compared a

1116
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:51,350
fingerprint

1117
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:53,690
I really need to speed up of course

1118
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:55,610
emoji being interpreted differently in

1119
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:57,920
New York translation problems so they

1120
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:59,630
write the English names below it to make

1121
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,880
it easier but that works quite well

1122
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:03,970
there's smart TVs we're probably not so

1123
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:08,060
smart you can hook them up to your Wi-Fi

1124
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:12,890
unless you have an emoji in your SSID in

1125
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:15,049
the Wi-Fi name if you have a Samsung TV

1126
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:17,690
that will scan for your networks and

1127
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:20,000
when it has a list it will cache that

1128
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:21,500
list to disk and then will display that

1129
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,950
list and while displaying that list it

1130
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:28,100
will crash you now have a denial service

1131
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:31,730
attack from your Wi-Fi to your TV when

1132
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:34,400
you reboot that TV and go to Wi-Fi again

1133
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:36,310
it immediately displays the cached list

1134
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:40,010
before scanning again

1135
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:42,470
now you need to factory reset your TV to

1136
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:45,080
make it work again and don't hook it up

1137
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:49,250
to Wi-Fi Apple had a very interesting

1138
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:52,460
way with emoji and really improving

1139
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:53,780
security you can set a passcode for your

1140
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:56,390
phone that when you unlock it you have

1141
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:58,700
to enter a passcode to unlock it and

1142
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:03,220
then you can use it works with many

1143
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:07,700
platforms this problem was iOS specific

1144
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:10,790
you could enable the emoji keyboard for

1145
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:13,819
entering and setting your passcode I

1146
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:16,670
have a super secret I put emoji in my

1147
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:18,560
passcode you lock your phone you want to

1148
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:20,099
unlock your phone you cannot switch to

1149
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:23,609
the emoji keyboard anymore

1150
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:27,839
that phones really secure now happened

1151
00:58:23,609 --> 00:58:29,729
they did fix that so sorry they did not

1152
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:31,589
fix it by allowing it the emoji keyboard

1153
00:58:29,729 --> 00:58:35,459
on the lockscreen but by not allowing

1154
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:38,670
emoji to be set as passphrases it's a

1155
00:58:35,459 --> 00:58:42,269
bummer I like emojis you might have a

1156
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:45,900
monitoring solution that might run some

1157
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:48,238
role old Perl code and you can have a

1158
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:50,789
lot of fun by putting emoji in your HTTP

1159
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:54,769
response headers that might lead to

1160
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:58,319
false down alerts even if the site is up

1161
00:58:54,769 --> 00:59:02,578
it happens so what's the future of emoji

1162
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:05,339
what's what's coming next probably not

1163
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:10,140
really next some things are already

1164
00:59:05,339 --> 00:59:13,799
here's an emoji animated emoji they move

1165
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:18,868
if you have a face tracking camera on

1166
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:20,940
your phone they can mimic your face with

1167
00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:23,039
an emoji and you can record that as a

1168
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:25,459
video and send it to someone so you can

1169
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:29,430
have like a little tiger or a unicorn

1170
00:59:25,459 --> 00:59:31,379
talk like you it's a lot of fun I don't

1171
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:34,640
see the business application for it yet

1172
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:39,059
but yeah you could share that there's

1173
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:41,368
MIMO G like you build some a character

1174
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:45,390
that looks like yourself but as a

1175
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:47,579
drawing is a emoji style drawing if you

1176
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:49,589
have an old Nintendo Wii console you

1177
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:52,640
might remember those mean characters

1178
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:55,949
they basically already work that way

1179
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:58,529
several years ago then there's custom

1180
00:59:55,949 --> 01:00:02,849
emoji especially messenger platforms and

1181
00:59:58,529 --> 01:00:05,279
online platforms try to use those to get

1182
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:08,160
more emoji that specifically are

1183
01:00:05,279 --> 01:00:12,239
targeted for their audience for example

1184
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:14,489
this is a list of the special emojis

1185
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:18,089
that are used on the chaos that social

1186
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:21,390
mastodon instance because anarchy is

1187
01:00:18,089 --> 01:00:25,049
always more fun with friends and there's

1188
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:27,180
some special characters relating to that

1189
01:00:25,049 --> 01:00:29,519
very special community like the fairy

1190
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:32,609
dust which is an iconic rocket character

1191
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:36,169
used by the CCC what else is interesting

1192
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:39,390
and coming with emoji court cases

1193
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:42,300
they're increasingly mentioned in court

1194
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:46,020
documents people are having legal fights

1195
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:48,720
over emoji or over messages sent with

1196
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:55,220
emoji and it's about how to interpret

1197
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:55,220
those emoji I mean

1198
01:00:55,930 --> 01:01:01,029
this this can be very difficult

1199
01:00:57,809 --> 01:01:03,849
linguistically there's also the emoji

1200
01:01:01,029 --> 01:01:06,940
mashup but it's a Twitter account if you

1201
01:01:03,849 --> 01:01:10,750
still use that it basically takes two

1202
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:13,210
emoji theoretically combines them with a

1203
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:15,250
zero with Jonah and ends up with a

1204
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:20,430
combination like that like party and

1205
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:23,890
vomiting should you really combine each

1206
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:27,250
emoji with each other probably not

1207
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:30,640
the Unicode consortium also explicitly

1208
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:33,069
tells you not to but technically that

1209
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:36,480
would be possible and these are possible

1210
01:01:33,069 --> 01:01:39,130
representations of absurd combinations

1211
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,170
if you want to use emoji on your

1212
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:43,210
computer and you're not using a Mac or

1213
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:47,549
iOS because they have really really good

1214
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:50,140
support for typography fonts and emoji

1215
01:01:47,549 --> 01:01:52,690
there's the open moji project it's an

1216
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:54,879
open source and free Libre and gratis

1217
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:59,230
font that you can use a new operating

1218
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:02,589
system to get a full unicode 12 set of

1219
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:06,220
emoji on any operating system for free

1220
01:02:02,589 --> 01:02:08,410
to use so you can finally put those

1221
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:13,538
emoji into your terminal to represent

1222
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:16,118
your get status if you know things that

1223
01:02:13,539 --> 01:02:19,299
should be emoji but that are not yet

1224
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:22,150
existing as emoji you can make your own

1225
01:02:19,299 --> 01:02:26,140
proposals to the Unicode consortium like

1226
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:30,880
oh I have this sport or recreation or

1227
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:35,140
thing or person type that should be

1228
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:37,450
represented by emoji you can enter young

1229
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:39,700
proposals you can see what's already

1230
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:42,189
been proposed if it has been rejected or

1231
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:44,890
approved there's a lot of documentation

1232
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:46,539
and guidelines on how to write and what

1233
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:49,240
to think about before making such a

1234
01:02:46,539 --> 01:02:52,059
proposal and also understanding the

1235
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:54,700
technical limitations that are possible

1236
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:56,529
within the unicode standard and you can

1237
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:59,740
also study other proposals that have

1238
01:02:56,529 --> 01:03:02,380
been successfully submitted so one day

1239
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:04,149
your own emoji that you came up with

1240
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:06,160
that you think is important for the

1241
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:07,530
world to communicate can be on

1242
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:10,740
everybody's phone

1243
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:13,590
click but you can you can help people

1244
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:18,120
communicate about new things by

1245
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:21,110
submitting that and coming 20 20

1246
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:23,430
we're now at Unicode twelve point one

1247
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:25,430
twelve point all was the last change

1248
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:28,859
that included emoji twelve point one

1249
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:30,839
edit a single Unicode character so we

1250
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:34,950
need to need it to update the standard

1251
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:41,330
because Japan started a new era with the

1252
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:43,470
new emperor and they edit the kana

1253
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:45,120
representation of the Emperor's name so

1254
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:48,149
that's why we had to update emoji the

1255
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:51,870
Unicode center with Unicode 13 coming

1256
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:54,900
2020 meaning next year we get a lot of

1257
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:57,150
new emoji and here's the park with IT

1258
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:59,460
security relevance people will update

1259
01:03:57,150 --> 01:04:02,910
their phones to get those new

1260
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:05,130
emojis and instantly like this is

1261
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:06,779
important I need this new emoji on my

1262
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:10,260
phone now I don't care for the security

1263
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:12,600
content of that update it's in there as

1264
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:14,820
well ok fine I'll take it I want those

1265
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:17,310
emoji and this is why emoji are

1266
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:20,430
important for phone security people will

1267
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:24,000
update for the emoji not for any

1268
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:26,580
security problem be as bad as you can

1269
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,100
imagine that's a reality of IT

1270
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:31,500
departments these days already but run

1271
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:35,580
large amounts of phones and mobile

1272
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:38,550
device management systems and what's

1273
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:42,440
what new emojis are coming ninja of

1274
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:47,250
course important a potted plant a

1275
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:49,380
mammoth a magic wand you might already

1276
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:52,800
have an idea how that might be

1277
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:56,310
interpreted or not screwdrivers very

1278
01:04:52,800 --> 01:05:00,330
important thing elevators and as a world

1279
01:04:56,310 --> 01:05:01,680
exclusive I can now link the graphical

1280
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:06,380
representation of one of the upcoming

1281
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,379
emojis it's the ninja emoji

1282

1286
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:23,720
Brian deer for sending me the plateau

1287
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:27,560
and coconut images and screen shots from

1288
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:30,560
the 70s especially from the emoji picker

1289
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:33,500
he created back then very many thanks to

1290
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:36,259
Kate Ian McCulloch she did the

1291
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:37,490
linguistic and semiotic studies on emoji

1292
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:41,150
like how do they work

1293
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:42,680
with language and to the SwiftKey emoji

1294
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:45,380
report if you have been using the

1295
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:47,750
SwiftKey keyboard on your phone the

1296
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:51,110
emoji you typed were statistically

1297
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:54,530
analyzed into an emoji usage report

1298
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:56,900
worldwide that gave us a lot of insight

1299
01:05:54,530 --> 01:06:00,740
about how people use and communicate

1300
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:02,840
with using emoji so thank you for to you

1301
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:06,529
all for using that keyword so I could

1302
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:09,880
give a talk and rant an hour about emoji

1303
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:09,880
are there any questions

1304
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:26,260
we'll we'll take two quick ones question

1305
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:41,800
I can speak up a little

1306
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:52,760
Tomita

1307
01:06:50,869 --> 01:06:54,280
bye moochy in domains are already

1308
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:58,250
possible because we have

1309
01:06:54,280 --> 01:07:00,530
internationalized domain names so if you

1310
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:02,840
go to like a monk a snowman is a Unicode

1311
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:04,760
character but not an emoji character but

1312
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:07,220
there are already emoji domains

1313
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:08,990
they're usually Punic code encoded with

1314
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:11,390
this xn - and then the hex

1315
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:13,000
representation but if you go to I don't

1316
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:15,980
know one PI mark now but there are

1317
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,540
unicode domains and they usually work in

1318
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:20,869
most modern browsers already and

1319
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:24,369
keywords yes there I'm sure their

1320
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:31,340
keyboards with emoji buttons already

1321
01:07:24,369 --> 01:07:33,859
online Hema and Sigma ok so there's

1322
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:38,510
already domains with that there was a

1323
01:07:33,859 --> 01:07:41,319
one question over there I think yes just

1324
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:41,320
a second for the microphone

1325
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:48,230
this

1326
01:07:56,180 --> 01:08:06,230
I don't know I don't know of any

1327
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:09,109
explicit currency emoji but there are a

1328
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:12,349
lot of currencies symbols like euro

1329
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:16,219
dollar yen and many others already in

1330
01:08:12,349 --> 01:08:18,140
the Unicode standard if you want a

1331
01:08:16,219 --> 01:08:21,290
crypto currency in there you can propose

1332
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:23,630
that to the Unicode consortium please

1333
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:25,460
look up if they have any objections or

1334
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:28,159
reasons why they would incorporate that

1335
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:31,370
or not I can quite imagine that they

1336
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:33,979
will are rather unlikely to include

1337
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:36,049
crypto currency currency symbols into

1338
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:45,080
the Unicode standard telecom we have an

1339
01:08:36,049 --> 01:08:47,479
addition to that I did not know that

1340
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:49,670
it's great I learned a lot when giving

1341
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:53,198
these talks thank you very much can we

1342
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:53,199
take one more so one last question

1343
01:08:53,259 --> 01:08:58,040
anyone

1344
01:08:55,189 --> 01:09:01,779
nope I'll take further questions over a

1345
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,779
beer thank you very much for your time

1346
01:09:25,948 --> 01:09:28,009
you
