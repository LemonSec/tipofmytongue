00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:36,360
hello everyone next topic is

2
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:41,699
lock-picking 101 102 Bezos thanks why

3
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,949
and this if you were here last year this

4
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:47,430
is the the same as the long presentation

5
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:50,550
last year so you know there really need

6
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,140
to do it again and hopefully Nina and

7
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,190
Joe are gonna show up at some point I

8
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,660
don't see them but they have a bunch of

9
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,530
locks and pics so people can actually

10
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,140
play in practice with them so it's not

11
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,260
just listening to a lot of stuff Plus

12
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,590
also this slide deck was very kindly

13
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,260
given to me by tool Boston the Oakland

14
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,890
organization of lock Vickers the u.s.

15
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,170
chapter so I can take no credit for the

16
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,690
visual materials I'm just gonna go

17
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,000
through through their deck and so I'm

18
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,520
leaving some of their stuff which which

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,950
is important to them such as the their

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,880
rules

21
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,200
don't pick locks which you don't own

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,729
there's actually a good reason for that

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,500
it's not just like you know we should be

24
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,908
nice it's because picking actually

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,350
damages locks to some extent so it's

26
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,539
possible to pick a lock to the point

27
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,339
where it doesn't work so it's nice to

28
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:44,399
just only do that to your own stuff and

29
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,079
other people's and that's also the

30
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,759
reason for rule number two if you rely

31
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,020
on the lock every time you pick it

32
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,969
you're damaging it a little bit and

33
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:57,990
eventually the proper key might not work

34
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:59,939
on it there's a few different kinds of

35
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,810
ways to open locks you can pick them

36
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:07,380
open you can do some sort of quick and

37
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:11,490
dirty bypass and then there's the real

38
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:15,359
covert entry high-tech thing so tool

39
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:19,590
does lock picking criminals do quick and

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,530
dirty and spies do the covert and

41
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:25,440
high-tech stuff so total teaches people

42
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,250
how to pick locks and they're very big

43
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,250
in Europe I don't know if there's a

44
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,170
chapter here in Serbia Serbia but there

45
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,690
are a lot of a lot of tool people in

46
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,280
here in Europe for quick and dirty to

47
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,480
tell you about it but don't doesn't give

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,239
you the tools

49
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,290
then you know nothing to do with the

50
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,190
covert and high-tech stuff but anyway

51
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,798
lock-picking is easy and fun

52
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,629
and most of what we'll talk about today

53
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,150
a pin tumbler locks because those are

54
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:54,599
most of the locks that you see on most

55
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,700
doors most padlocks this is what they

56
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:00,119
look like from the outside so you can

57
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,709
see kind of a wiggly slot that the key

58
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,410
goes into that's called the key way and

59
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,690
you can just see in the front there the

60
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,510
start of one of the pins so here's like

61
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:12,390
a graphic of what the pin tumbler lock

62
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,370
looks like from the outside and if you

63
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,040
just slice away that first part of the

64
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:21,930
lock what you'd see there is the first

65
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:27,660
pin stack and so there's a bottom pin a

66
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:29,099
top pin and a spring and the bottom pane

67
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,599
and often called the key pin that's the

68
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,160
one that changes lengths depending on

69
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,890
the bidding of the key the bidding

70
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,170
meaning you know the the heights that he

71
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,569
is cut to the top is to drive the pin

72
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,059
and then above that that spring is what

73
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:47,130
returns the lock to its original state

74
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,810
when the key is removed so I'm not sure

75
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,220
if I remembered now if I have to press

76
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:55,579
space to make these animations work

77
00:03:50,220 --> 00:04:00,269
there we go if you try to turn the lock

78
00:03:55,579 --> 00:04:03,090
plug without putting the key in that top

79
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:07,769
drive a pin prevents it from moving it

80
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:12,900
blocks the rotation of that plug if you

81
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:15,389
stick a key in there it will raise the

82
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,418
key pin to the correct height so that

83
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:21,750
now there is a gap that's aligned with

84
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:25,020
the outside of the plug that's called

85
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:29,130
the shear line and that allows the plug

86
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:32,820
to rotate so that's totally how the lock

87
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:34,199
works with with pin number one and then

88
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,110
if we look at it from the side we can

89
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,960
see all of the pin stacks some locks

90
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:43,889
have three or four pin stacks some have

91
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,909
five six seven depends on the lock so

92
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:49,330
once again

93
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:53,230
the key comes in raises all of the key

94
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:56,979
pins to the shear line and then the the

95
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:58,540
plug can turn and lock and open and all

96
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,990
of those have to be in exactly the right

97
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,480
place

98
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:05,320
so if that key is not correctly cut by

99
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:09,160
even one bidding so you can see here one

100
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,719
of them is too low and now not all of

101
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,570
those driver pins line up at the shear

102
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,580
line and so the plug won't turn same

103
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,700
situation if we've got one getting too

104
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:22,990
high so the key means if you cut

105
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,849
correctly or the lock doesn't open if

106
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,460
everything was perfect if everything was

107
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:30,060
drawing like a CAD model everything

108
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,710
would be perfectly in alignment here and

109
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,260
when you turned the plug without a key

110
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,659
in it all of those top pins all those

111
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,810
driver pins would bind at the same time

112
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:44,560
right buying meaning to stick and so if

113
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:46,420
you were to try and move those pin specs

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,510
that all be stuck when you're applying

115
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,970
tension to the lock but we live in the

116
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:55,300
real world where things get manufactured

117
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:58,030
to a tolerance and so that's what the

118
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,750
holes in the plug really look like they

119
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:04,320
are not exactly perfect same for the

120
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:09,430
pins they have defamations and and

121
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:12,300
problems with it so when you turn the

122
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:16,180
plug to provide some tension on the lock

123
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:19,090
it's as likely as not only one of the

124
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:22,480
pin stacks will bind so that means we

125
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:25,659
can check the state of that pin stock

126
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:29,460
without picks so here you'd from the

127
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:37,290
front of the lock if this pin is binding

128
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:39,870
and now we puts push up that stack then

129
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:42,540
we are able to detect the point at which

130
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:45,000
we encounter the she line so watching

131
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,460
that again as that set comes up you can

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,060
see we get a little movement out of the

133
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:54,120
plug when we hit the shear line and then

134
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:58,530
after that point we call we call that

135
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:01,890
the driver pin being set so after that

136
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:06,869
happens it's gonna be locked in place

137
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:08,430
and now the bottom pin can just fold

138
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,440
down freely and we'll be able to see

139
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,300
that jiggling up and down or you can

140
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,840
shake the lock and jiggle it and I'll

141
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:19,710
push it with with your tool whatever and

142
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,270
so to do that for a complete lock we

143
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,710
just do that process over and over again

144
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,060
so the piece that just came in at the

145
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,799
bottom there that's our tension tool

146
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,250
that's what we're using to apply a

147
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,610
torque to the lock and now we use our

148
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:36,180
pick to test some pins these ones I'm

149
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,890
moving you know more or less easily but

150
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,500
this one has got some tension on it

151
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,630
because it's binding and then we can

152
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,230
click it into place now a different pin

153
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,230
is binding

154
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:55,580
and so this process just repeats finding

155
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:58,270
the binding pin until eventually the

156
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,039
lock will open I let the animation play

157
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,659
and this animations been developed as

158
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,820
though we're not keeping track of which

159
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,880
one's binding so sometimes it'll go and

160
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:14,390
tests some of the ones that have already

161
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:17,150
been set and hopefully yes do the last

162
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,770
one quickly and then the lock turns so

163
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:22,270
that's what we that's basically what we

164
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:24,200
want to do to pick a pin tumbler lock

165
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:28,750
one of the things we have to watch out

166
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:32,330
for is over lifting so that's where

167
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:36,470
we're tension that lock and we're

168
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:39,830
pushing up the pin stacks and it's not

169
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:44,600
that difficult to quickly whip one of

170
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:46,550
these up above so that the key pin ends

171
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,000
up above the she line I think it'll be

172
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:54,319
on the last one here in this animation

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,920
and so now there's nothing that we can

174
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,840
do to open this lock

175
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,579
even after we you know test all the

176
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,190
other ones so the right thing to do like

177
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,600
you just saw is if you're picking a lock

178
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,970
for a while and you think you might have

179
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,710
over lifted a pin and it's not gonna

180
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,960
open just release some tension a little

181
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:17,810
bit let let those set pins click back

182
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:20,930
down again and start again so though the

183
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:23,959
lock pick that we just saw views in

184
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:26,180
those example is just a hook pick so

185
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,280
it's designed to actuate one pin stack

186
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,920
at a time but there are lots of other

187
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:34,640
types of picks so for example this is a

188
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,920
rake and what you're doing with raking

189
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,210
it's basically you're playing the odds

190
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,920
you're doing kind of a probabilistic

191
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,080
approach and you're wiggling around all

192
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,740
these pins at once and hoping that they

193
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,870
they set and then the lock up so you can

194
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:53,300
and when you're lucky rake open a lock

195
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:55,340
really really fast but raking can be not

196
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,170
so effective if the bidding of

197
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,180
neighboring pins is very different right

198
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,550
if so if you need to move

199
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,870
one pin some small amount and the other

200
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,640
one allowed your mount right next to it

201
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:08,870
the rakes not necessarily going to be

202
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,600
able to make that happen the half

203
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:16,340
diamond so here we've got a hook half

204
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,560
diamond and wreak on the screen and one

205
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,150
in the middle is the half diamond the

206
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,449
half time is pretty cool it's like if I

207
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:25,730
only have one pick on me it would pretty

208
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:30,050
much be a half diamond because you can

209
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:31,730
lift pins with it you can also sort of

210
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,829
rake with it by shoveling back and forth

211
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:37,550
and that's causing pins to flip up and

212
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:39,200
down and you can count pins using the

213
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,900
flat on the side so you flip the pick

214
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:47,060
over put it all the way in lift all the

215
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:50,780
pins up and then as you pull this back

216
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,260
you'll hear or feel or both click-click

217
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,060
click-click

218
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,290
as those pins drop down and that lets

219
00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:00,079
you know how many pins you're dealing

220
00:10:54,290 --> 00:11:02,480
with in the lock the tension tool

221
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,340
sometimes these guys call it the turning

222
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,320
tool it's just basically an l-shaped

223
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:11,420
piece of metal and usually you won't

224
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,330
want to pull on the tension tool by

225
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,770
using your thumb instead push it with

226
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,230
your finger from the other side it's a

227
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,819
better technique and the further out you

228
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,290
can push it the more leverage you have

229
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,730
and that gives you more control you're

230
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,730
not longer certainly because you want to

231
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,060
push that cylinder around really really

232
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,000
hard

233
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,680
but you just want to be able to apply

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,460
more or less force and that's easier

235
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:36,739
with more leverage and so a good rule of

236
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:39,560
thumb or a rule of finger if you want is

237
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,940
to sort of look at the color of your

238
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,739
finger when you're pushing on it so here

239
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,990
you can see the finger is still pink but

240
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,430
if you're pushing too hard you've got

241
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,840
white at the end of the finger you're

242
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,229
probably putting too much pressure on

243
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,660
the lock because you have to make the

244
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,490
set pin move right so the how do you

245
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:58,250
bind that pin the more difficult is

246
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:00,260
gonna be to lift it with your with your

247
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,760
pick and so putting too much tension on

248
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:08,380
the lock is gonna work against you

249
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,810
you can usually use these tools that's

250
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,389
turn by at the edge of the plug so

251
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,680
sliding in the bottom there and you're

252
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:16,779
turning tools look like this

253
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:21,339
well they've sometimes they've got a bit

254
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:22,810
at each end sometimes they're folded

255
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:25,810
over or folded and twisted the one on

256
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,489
the left is folded and twisted the one

257
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:29,229
all the way to the right is just folded

258
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,760
a lot of this is just personal

259
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,959
preference what you end up liking so

260
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,380
this is a good reason to mess around

261
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:37,779
have some fun and see what you like they

262
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,490
come in different widths because when

263
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,620
you've got a tension tool jammed in the

264
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,779
in the key way that takes up some space

265
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,449
that's a pet in that space that you

266
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:48,880
can't use to put your pick in so

267
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:50,319
sometimes you can get these slimmer

268
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,310
profile ones that take up less space in

269
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,600
the QA that's a no-show it's showing

270
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,000
that's the the room you've got to move

271
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,649
in and then you can also there's a slide

272
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,209
later on use one that turns from the

273
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:04,360
center of the plug instead if you need

274
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:05,920
that bottom space in the keyway be

275
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,649
careful here you don't want to jam it

276
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,180
into the bottom of the keyway because

277
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:12,010
then you're causing friction that's

278
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,888
actually preventing the sealing on

279
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:17,350
different turning now here's an example

280
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:19,600
of the flat turning tool on the right

281
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:25,779
that you can turn from the center of the

282
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:27,730
plug occasionally useful because it

283
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:31,750
gives you more space to work with but

284
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:34,300
you're still you know blocking some

285
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:38,500
movement of your of your pick if your

286
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,819
pick has a is itself wide it might run

287
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,069
into the bottom of the tension tool

288
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,540
there so it's not it's not the kind of

289
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:45,250
magic thing that's is like well why

290
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,719
don't we just always use that because it

291
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,930
does still block the key way to some

292
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,410
extent not all locks open in the same

293
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:55,989
direction so that's a it's good to sort

294
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,910
of you know have an idea of which way to

295
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:01,810
be turning it so it's gonna gonna unlock

296
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:04,170
it padlocks are often in the clockwise

297
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,170
direction

298
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,279
door locks are often the other way

299
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:14,679
except force legs which is clockwise

300
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:17,679
again deadbolts usually go both ways so

301
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:19,899
it depending on which is handedness the

302
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,299
door is so if the latch is on the right

303
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:25,449
of the door then the deadbolt is gonna

304
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:27,309
retract counterclockwise most likely and

305
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,689
then clockwise if it's on the left

306
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:34,660
if it's on the left-hand side of the

307
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:36,639
doorway I will just skip through this

308
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,189
stuff because this is for the tool

309
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,790
lockpick village but tool sells these a

310
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:44,529
range of practice locks and they have

311
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,389
different numbers of pins and different

312
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:50,699
difficulties they have some anti picking

313
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:52,779
things which I'll gets you later and

314
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:55,599
they tell you which is the front in the

315
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:57,699
back and on those practice locks either

316
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,439
directions will work so when you're

317
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:01,209
getting started and again hopefully

318
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:06,910
we'll have some stuff set up outside

319
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:10,719
after this practice lifting a pin with

320
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:13,839
the pick practice tensioning the lock

321
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,139
and getting pit and getting um pins to

322
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,699
bind practice finding the binding pin

323
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:20,379
and track this practice different types

324
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:22,508
of lifting sometimes you want to lift up

325
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:24,339
directly sometimes you can sort of rock

326
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:27,249
it and you can use the bottom of the key

327
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:29,559
ways for a bit of extra leverage and

328
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:35,040
just relax and tell people when you got

329
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:37,209
the lock open I'm just gonna move past

330
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,529
questions but you can shout out

331
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,229
questions if you if you have them

332
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:42,100
interrupt that in mind

333
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,799
another type of lock that you'll see a

334
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,360
lot of is wafer locks so wafer locks

335
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,029
work basically the same as pin tumbler

336
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,610
locks except instead of pins the pieces

337
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:54,399
that interrupt the lock are stamped

338
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,110
pieces of metal so flat pieces of metal

339
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,790
they call wafers so that's what one

340
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,429
that's got its case removed looks like

341
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:04,329
and you can see all of those flat metal

342
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:07,509
wafers sticking up out of the plug and

343
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:09,368
they can move up and down so if you look

344
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:11,199
at it from the front you see the front

345
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:12,490
of the of the lock and then you can see

346
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,769
the red piece there it's one of the

347
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,269
wafers you slice away that front of the

348
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:19,539
lock you can see what a wafer looks like

349
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:21,100
it's kind of an oval it's got a piece a

350
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:23,410
rectangular piece at each end which is

351
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,869
what interrupts the rotation of the of

352
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:28,269
the keyway and then the piece in the

353
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:32,289
middle where that rectangle is cut out

354
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:33,549
is like the length in the case of the

355
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:35,619
pin tumbler lock like the length of the

356
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:38,160
key pin so that determines when you put

357
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:44,589
the key in how much this gets pushed up

358
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:46,629
such that it ends up in a place where

359
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:51,100
the two sheer lines are aligned and the

360
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:53,860
lock can rotate so this is just like an

361
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,230
easy and cheap way to make locks you

362
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,419
don't need two pins per stack you don't

363
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,399
need Springs you can make these locks

364
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:05,039
very very inexpensively and so that's

365
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:10,569
why you find them on filing cabinets on

366
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:13,000
you know electrical panels you know

367
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:15,789
stuff that is not necessarily high

368
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,819
security and and these can be picked

369
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:21,429
generally pretty easily you can use your

370
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:24,428
regular lock picks on them and then you

371
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:26,829
can also buy specific lock picks for

372
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:30,220
picking wafer locks and especially wafer

373
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:32,529
jigglers that you can buy a set from

374
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,419
places that sell lock clicking tools and

375
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:36,970
they're just like a set of a few

376
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:38,169
different keys that'll fit most wait for

377
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,549
lock so you just put them in and jiggle

378
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:42,570
them around and usually these things

379
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:42,570
will open very very quickly

380
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:50,280
come bow locks things which you find a

381
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,590
lot of time around the place especially

382
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,990
this the master combination lock which

383
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:57,840
is infamous for being very very common

384
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:02,370
you know school lockers and stuff like

385
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:05,129
that and also really easy to bypass in a

386
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,629
couple of different ways so if you're

387
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,160
put one of these on your locker you're

388
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,620
basically just telling people not to

389
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,520
open it because if they try they will

390
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:17,820
open it really easily it was fun last

391
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,780
year when I gave the short version of

392
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,340
this at the start of the conference

393
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,210
someone came along with one of these

394
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,590
locks that they'd forgotten the

395
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,430
combination for so we got to practice

396
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,659
all of these techniques for opening it

397
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,880
the easiest way to open that is with a

398
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:34,250
padlock shim so this is a very slim

399
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:38,880
piece of metal that you slide down the

400
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:42,150
hospice shackle of the lock and it just

401
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,980
pushes the latch out of the way it's

402
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:49,170
just kind of like using us using a

403
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:52,440
credit card to open a door you can make

404
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:55,050
these really easily out of a can so get

405
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,080
one of those yellow beer cans that

406
00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:02,600
everywhere here and kind of cut a piece

407
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:06,149
of aluminum off the can fold it over and

408
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:08,399
then you've got yourself yeah a nice

409
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:10,770
disposable shim this won't work a lot of

410
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,840
times because aluminum is soft but it'll

411
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,790
work long enough to open one lock bend

412
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,560
it around the body of a ballpoint pen

413
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:24,480
and then you've got a free padlock shim

414
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:26,280
and then you just slide that down this

415
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,090
works on like most of these types of

416
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,980
padlocks on the the master lock the the

417
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:34,439
latch is on the left the one we found

418
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,610
last year and we opened with a shim the

419
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,190
latches on the other side so you might

420
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:41,100
have to try both sides of the padlock to

421
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,950
get this to work and then it'll just pop

422
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,340
right open so these are super easy and

423
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,169
this is

424
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:51,668
opening some truck lock with a Guinness

425
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:54,039
can padlock shim kaboom

426
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:55,240
sometimes you need to Siam's some of

427
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,158
these padlocks have a latch on both

428
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,409
sides

429
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:00,490
lots of padlocks that are better quality

430
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:02,620
and more expensive

431
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:06,039
you can't shim they have this double

432
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:08,860
ball bearing mechanism so you can see in

433
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:11,440
this diagram the two ball bearings are

434
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,389
inside the cutaways in the shackle the

435
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,130
shackle can't come out then that big

436
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:17,678
chunk of metal in the middle when the

437
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:20,409
key rotates that rotates and allows the

438
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,870
ball bearings to slide inwards and the

439
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:24,370
thing opens but when the the key when

440
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,709
the lock is locked when the key is not

441
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,989
in there in turned that big piece of

442
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,789
metal is blocking the ball bearings they

443
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,529
can't move so there's no way to push

444
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:37,929
them out of the way with a shim so you

445
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:39,940
can't shim this type of lock and this

446
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:41,830
slider the one on the right is the one

447
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:46,059
that you'll typically see on it on a

448
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:47,408
double ball padlock and then is that you

449
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:49,000
can you can actually buy a lot of

450
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:51,700
cutaway versions of all these locks

451
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,210
really cheaply now China for whatever

452
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:57,970
reason has fully got into the lock lock

453
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,919
Smith teaching tools game and so on

454
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,679
Amazon there are all these acrylic

455
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,019
bodied see-through transparent locks and

456
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:08,529
you can get a full set you know for

457
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:10,950
fifteen or twenty dollars including disc

458
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:14,740
detainer with double ball bearing and

459
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:16,210
various just pin tumbler padlocks and

460
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,009
you can see what's going on they're

461
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,990
really really handy and fun for

462
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:25,360
practicing lock picking because you can

463
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:25,779
get the visual feedback this is kind of

464
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,240
fun

465
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:33,450
the way to decode the combination for

466
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:37,929
these master locks many types of

467
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:42,759
mechanical combination lock and like you

468
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:45,279
know bad safe locks a subject to attacks

469
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:47,559
by feeling what the lock does as you

470
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,879
move the combination dials around you

471
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:51,220
know you could get that kind of tactile

472
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:53,019
feedback and the usual way that you do

473
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,670
this is you put some tension on the

474
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:57,280
shackle and

475
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:59,140
some some times that I've seen some

476
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,030
sites advocate putting a string around

477
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,950
it and that way you can slip your hand

478
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:05,470
in that string and just really you know

479
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,570
have a lot of leverage on that while you

480
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:12,100
manipulate the dial you put some tension

481
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:13,629
on it and then you rotate the lock first

482
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,490
thing by the way you have to do is to

483
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:18,220
spin this lock clockwise about three

484
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:20,350
times so that you have reset the lock

485
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:24,160
but then you're gonna rotate the dial

486
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:25,600
and feel where it seems to stick when

487
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:31,180
you've got some tension on the shackle

488
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,500
and it'll stick for every stick position

489
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,930
it'll actually stick a little bit either

490
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,280
side of the true position so you sort of

491
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,510
feel where it starts the stick and then

492
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:42,040
you go from the other side and you feel

493
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:44,379
where it's not just to stick and get an

494
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,980
idea of either side of the sticking

495
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,660
point and then write down what's in the

496
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,910
middle of the two sides of that sticking

497
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,950
point so in this case you know if we've

498
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,390
got it stucks T starting to stick it for

499
00:22:53,950 --> 00:23:00,310
and sign just to get six then our

500
00:22:55,390 --> 00:23:03,460
sticking point is five but be aware with

501
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,840
this type of lock that in a bunch of

502
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,190
cases the sticking point is are going to

503
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:11,409
be at a fractional point it's going to

504
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:14,440
be at the half point the either side is

505
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:18,310
gonna be a number and a half and the

506
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:20,020
middle is also gonna be a half and then

507
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:22,030
you're gonna write down all the places

508
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,770
where it sticks for this type of master

509
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:27,760
lock that should be twelve sticking

510
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:29,010
points and what we're looking for is the

511
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,780
odd one out

512
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,910
English idiom the black sheep of the

513
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,560
family so we're looking for a number

514
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,970
that's a whole number we're not gonna

515
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,909
worry about the fractional numbers and

516
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:45,120
that doesn't have the same last digit as

517
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:48,640
the other whole numbers that we found so

518
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,350
let me go back here if we look at this

519
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,910
one we can see we've got a lot of

520
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,919
fractional ones on either side and then

521
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,840
in the middle all the ones have a last

522
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,760
digit of five so there isn't an odd one

523
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,649
out here so that means we it up

524
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,900
somewhere and we didn't get exactly the

525
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,790
right sticking points so go back you

526
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,490
know look at our fractional sticking

527
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:07,879
points are we really sure that they're

528
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,919
all in the right place

529
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:11,748
no we got this one wrong it's really 23

530
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,299
and that's the one we're looking for

531
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:16,369
that's the odd one out because it's not

532
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:18,649
a fraction it doesn't have the same last

533
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:21,678
digit as the other whole numbers that's

534
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:24,319
the one we want and this gives us what

535
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,109
we can call a magic number the magic

536
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:29,418
number is the modulo the modulo four

537
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:31,519
divisor this number so you divide the

538
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:33,259
number by four and the remainder is the

539
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,979
magic number so in this case it's a

540
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:39,979
three and now that's the that's gonna be

541
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:41,779
the last number of the three digit three

542
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:43,389
number combination right so to open

543
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:45,769
these locks you seven - three numbers

544
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:49,968
twenty-three is our last one and three

545
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:53,329
is our magic number and so now we can

546
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:55,069
come up with 20 possibilities for the

547
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:59,239
first and the second number based on

548
00:24:55,069 --> 00:25:00,829
this so for the first number we start

549
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:03,139
with the magic number and then add four

550
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:05,359
repeatedly to it and that's our that's

551
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:09,019
our ten possibilities we know the first

552
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:10,879
one is 3 7 11 15 so on up to 39 and then

553
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:14,869
for the second number if a magic number

554
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:18,198
is a 0 or a 1 add 2 to it or if it's 2

555
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:21,859
or 3 subtract 2 from it and then add 4

556
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:24,529
in sequence and so what we have is a

557
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:27,168
hundred things to try because we know

558
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:30,139
the third number and so you know this

559
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:32,059
little bit of arithmetic followed by

560
00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:36,559
just trying these combinations you'll

561
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:37,879
probably decode the combination in you

562
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,989
know maybe 15 minutes something like

563
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:43,099
that so that's kind of fun and of course

564
00:25:41,989 --> 00:25:45,889
once you have the combination it always

565
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:47,299
works unlike shimming it open then if

566
00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:49,399
you lock it you've got a shimmer it

567
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:51,469
again this time you've got the

568
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:52,908
combination and so you can you know

569
00:25:51,469 --> 00:25:57,159
secretly open this lock whenever you

570
00:25:52,909 --> 00:26:01,239
want to and this this type of technique

571
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:01,239
works for

572
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:06,800
a lot of other types of locks too not

573
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,850
the same one with the magic number and

574
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,830
all that kind of stuff that's unique to

575
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,260
the master combo lock but putting

576
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:15,949
tension on the shackle and feeling for

577
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,720
where different wheels bind and where

578
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,640
the shackle moves a little bit that's

579
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,840
just a great technique in general for

580
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,840
decoding combination locks

581
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:34,840
so I said before with next at some point

582
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:39,488
we'd get to pick resistance so give us

583
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,928
back to pin tumbler locks again so you

584
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:42,610
know everyone knows that this lock

585
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:44,350
picking these lock picking methods work

586
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:48,508
on pin tumbler locks so lock

587
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:50,649
manufacturers have made ways to

588
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:53,230
developed ways to try and make it harder

589
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:56,529
to pick things so the first kind of line

590
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:59,529
of defense is to choose the right key

591
00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:01,960
way a key way that's got a lot of open

592
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:03,700
space on both sides has a lot of room

593
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,879
for picks to move in that makes life

594
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:11,679
easy we can make things a little bit

595
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:13,379
more difficult by making the the key way

596
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,330
a little ball a little more funky shaped

597
00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:21,219
or making it really really thin and

598
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:23,199
curvy we can make it really hot you can

599
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:26,049
see that with not a lot of room to move

600
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,470
a pic around in and then something like

601
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:31,149
this that really really makes it tough

602
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:35,470
to put a pic in there and move it up and

603
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:38,289
down so you know it sort of depends on

604
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:42,690
the security level of the lock but let's

605
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:46,989
say given a normal fairly simple key way

606
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:53,070
we can also make the pins resistant to

607
00:27:46,989 --> 00:27:53,070
picking so this is one of the

608
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:58,880
common pick resistant pins it's called a

609
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,080
spool pin because it looks like a spool

610
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:06,530
spool of thread and the spool pin allows

611
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:10,340
the lock to turn even when you know a

612
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:14,270
little bit even when the driver pin is

613
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:17,030
not at the shear line so we don't we're

614
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:19,280
not able to detect on that pin stack if

615
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:22,270
we're in the right place or not because

616
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,270
the locks gonna turn anyway

617
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:32,800
see ya so even when we even when we push

618
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:34,870
that pin up we might think we're in the

619
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,409
right place but it's finding at a place

620
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:40,090
with a lock point turn so if you're

621
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,560
trying to pick a lock with a spool pin

622
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,510
in it it's poking is a little bit more

623
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,280
expensive to make so often a lock will

624
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,870
add security by just adding one spool

625
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,760
pin there won't be an older pin stack so

626
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:52,000
if we think that was a spool pin and a

627
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:55,990
lock we can still try to pick it because

628
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,410
we can sort of mark on the key way where

629
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:03,490
the zero point is and we can see the

630
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:04,750
lock move both sort of both sides of the

631
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,520
spool pin when it's in there when it's

632
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,770
in the correct binding the setting place

633
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,590
and when it's not and so we can relax

634
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:14,379
ease off some of the tension as we lift

635
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:17,679
that spool pin this animation here is

636
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,940
assuming that it's the last pin that we

637
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:22,540
need to pick that we have the other one

638
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:24,760
set and we can sort of back off a little

639
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:28,090
but it's you know easier said than done

640
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,860
because the other pins are gonna gonna

641
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:32,199
drop down when we release the tension so

642
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,490
you have to sort of develop an idea of

643
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,560
what you think that spool pin is but

644
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:40,390
spool pian locks are still definitely

645
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:41,980
pickable there are other kinds of pick

646
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:46,590
resistant pins that we see the mushroom

647
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:50,260
pin which is similar similar to a spool

648
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:51,820
the serrated pin I have a lot of trouble

649
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,879
with these I found a lock the other day

650
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:57,639
on the road and have padlock come like

651
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,320
all cool practice picking and it turned

652
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,810
out to be some high-security padlock

653
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,700
where every single pin was a serrated

654
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,350
pin and so these pins just buy in

655
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,560
constantly every everywhere they are

656
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:10,270
they Jam in and you once they jammed you

657
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,470
can't lift them it's very difficult to

658
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,660
tell whether real line is and actually

659
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,670
so I pick up this padlock it was open I

660
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,640
locked it and then I haven't been able

661
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:20,650
to pick it open yet I've spent like a

662
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,580
couple of hours on this lock and having

663
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,410
been how to get it back open again

664
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:26,820
because it's all serrated pins not that

665
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,820
I'm the greatest lock taker but

666
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:35,220
then there's after has this sneaky pin

667
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:35,220
which has it's kind of a double spool

668
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:42,840
and then these are these are like vendor

669
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:49,800
proprietary pins there's a double

670
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:52,110
mushroom as well and yeah these these

671
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,950
really make picking a lot more difficult

672
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:59,040
you can still pick them but you have to

673
00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:02,340
be very skilled or be very lucky like

674
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:05,280
you can maybe rake them open and then

675
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:07,620
just happen to get it the right way once

676
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:10,340
and then you know spendin how it trying

677
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,340
to do it a second time

678
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:18,780
another kind of interesting attack that

679
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:21,120
became super popular

680
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:24,299
I know 15 years ago or something like

681
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:29,030
that bump attacks you might have heard

682
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:32,010
of bump keys so the bump key is

683
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:36,240
basically a special kind of key that's

684
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:37,740
been cut down all the way and all of the

685
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,570
bidding and then had its shoulder a

686
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:42,620
little bit shaved off and then you need

687
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:45,629
a little bit of skill to use them but a

688
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:47,280
lot of locks that otherwise a pretty

689
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:50,790
high security a vulnerable to bumping

690
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,799
and it's related to physics it's related

691
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:56,580
to physics like you'd see on a billiards

692
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:58,679
table pool table so you know you know on

693
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:05,070
a pool table when you hit two bowls that

694
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:07,700
are touching each other sorry I messed

695
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:10,290
up the animation here here we go

696
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:13,020
the three ball there in that animation

697
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:15,600
doesn't move because all of the force is

698
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:18,960
transferred through it to the next ball

699
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:22,350
and it's the one that moves and this

700
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,090
technique is used in these pic snapping

701
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,340
guns that you might have seen sometimes

702
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,379
how I see sharp in the movies you know

703
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,120
some spy movie or something doodle just

704
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:34,710
stick this gun in the lock and gesture

705
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:38,489
and it'll open and how that works is it

706
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:43,440
whacks all of the pins at once with that

707
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:46,980
little snapper thing and just like the

708
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,530
the pool balls that impulse force to the

709
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:53,610
bottom pins is transferred to the driver

710
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:57,210
pins and they all very briefly flung up

711
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:59,189
above the shield line and so if you turn

712
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,049
that plug at just the right moment when

713
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:04,280
all the driver pins are up above the

714
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:04,280
shear then the lock will open

715
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:14,040
it's a close-up of that mechanism so

716
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:18,870
bumping works the same way you're using

717
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:23,790
the ridges on that deep cut key to slap

718
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:27,780
those pins as you in this case jam the

719
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:31,520
bump key in or you can also do it the

720
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:36,300
other way and pull the you know have the

721
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:40,340
key only go a little bit in so this is

722
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,340
one we have the shoulder of the key

723
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,419
filed down a little bit so that the key

724
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:51,419
goes in a little further than it

725
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:53,850
ordinarily would and so what's not shown

726
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:57,300
in that animation is you're not just

727
00:33:53,850 --> 00:34:00,000
pushing that key in by hand you have a

728
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,669
little hammer and you tap it and that

729
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,580
knocks everything up and you tap and

730
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:10,649
turn it in just the right timing and the

731
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:12,569
lock will open and even relatively high

732
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:14,580
security locks like medicos and so on

733
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:19,200
have been subset susceptible to bumping

734
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:20,370
attacks here's an example you know sort

735
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,049
of going back to the beginning if don't

736
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:23,668
do this two locks you want don't own so

737
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,580
here's an example of a lock that's been

738
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:28,290
bumped to destruction you can see the

739
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:31,790
cracks and and dents there where people

740
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:34,739
have just been whacking into this lock

741
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:36,509
there are some countermeasures to stop

742
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,009
bumping from being effective so one way

743
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:40,830
is to have a driver pin that has a

744
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:43,230
little shelf on it and sits above the

745
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:45,210
keep in there so that when they're when

746
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:49,320
they're bumped there's not an animation

747
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:51,000
for that one that final pin will jump up

748
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,500
but it won't transfer the force fully

749
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,389
that last pin it won't lift that last

750
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,090
pin so there'll be one pin stopping the

751
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:59,520
lock from opening still and then you can

752
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:01,170
also get these anti bump driver pins so

753
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,230
this is a pin that has a different

754
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:06,270
spring and different mass and so it's

755
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:08,090
not going to move the same way as all

756
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,859
the other pins do when they get bumped

757
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:15,229
it's a picture of that

758
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:17,819
and you can see online you know these

759
00:35:15,229 --> 00:35:24,149
bump resistant cylinders and conversion

760
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:25,788
kits to make locks bump resistant this

761
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:29,759
is just a bunch of slides on like

762
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:30,930
resources where to find locksmiths and

763
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:33,959
tools which I'll just skip through

764
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:36,779
because I'm sure they have no relevance

765
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:41,690
to Serbia you guys will have to find

766
00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:45,479
where to get tools and supplies from the

767
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:47,519
thing with picking is once you're done

768
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:49,589
the lock is open but if you lock it

769
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,839
again you have to start all over again

770
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:53,009
right and maybe you just got lucky and

771
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,359
raked it open and it's a really hard

772
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:55,890
lock to pick and maybe you could take a

773
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:57,450
really long time to open again so it

774
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:02,009
doesn't give you any kind of future

775
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:04,468
access to the lock the exception that I

776
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:06,329
make slides on it ah the tubular lock

777
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:11,549
picks so you know the tubular locks that

778
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:14,729
are often on bike locks vending machines

779
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:18,150
in Wills talked yesterday on freaking

780
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:21,049
elevators most of the elevator panels

781
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:24,479
that he showed had tubular locks on them

782
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:25,890
they you can get picks for those who and

783
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:28,198
they are basically an impression a tool

784
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:32,459
they have a bunch of little pins that

785
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:34,140
have like a rubber band putting some

786
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:36,169
tension on them and you manipulate them

787
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:39,118
into the lock and once you get it open

788
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:42,809
the position of those pins is set and

789
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,640
you can use that if you don't reset your

790
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:45,959
tubular pick you can use that to open

791
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,519
that lock and over and over again so

792
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:50,519
you've basically got an impression of

793
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:52,198
the lock and you can do impression with

794
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:55,308
a blank key for a normal pin tumbler

795
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:58,380
locks to and end up with a working key

796
00:36:55,309 --> 00:37:01,380
so that's why at the end you've got a

797
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:04,739
key so what you do is you start off with

798
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,660
a bland uncut blank and push that in

799
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:11,339
there so that all of the pin stacks are

800
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:12,690
raised to the maximum point and then you

801
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:14,729
turn you know what's not gonna open

802
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:19,069
right all those key pins are above the

803
00:37:14,729 --> 00:37:21,930
shear line but if you turn it real hard

804
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:24,480
then are you gonna bind at least one of

805
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:28,230
those key pins hopefully just one

806
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,450
and then wiggle the key and you're gonna

807
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:33,000
cause some rubbing on the top of your

808
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:36,118
key and then you take your blank out and

809
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,819
you look at where the rub marks are so

810
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,680
right here we've got two spots where

811
00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:42,200
they rubbed and we fouled them down a

812
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:46,019
little bit so you get a little tiny file

813
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:51,480
file down the key whether up with a the

814
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:53,308
back side and then keep doing it still

815
00:37:51,480 --> 00:38:00,480
still binding at one point still getting

816
00:37:53,309 --> 00:38:02,789
a rubbing then look for our marks file

817
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:08,609
down a little bit more and keep going

818
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:12,599
and at the point when one the pins back

819
00:38:08,609 --> 00:38:14,970
stops binding you'll get a new mark from

820
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:18,269
somewhere else so here we've got a mark

821
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:22,740
from this stack but not from step four

822
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:24,538
and then also a new one here so you know

823
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,910
we've filed down the new marks we've

824
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:33,319
we're done at the ones that don't don't

825
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:38,390
have marks this can take a while this

826
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:41,210
let's see can I see the mark

827
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:45,040
but he I think starting from the

828
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:45,040
shoulder one two three four or five

829
00:38:50,710 --> 00:39:01,120
i thinkyeah to that little tiny marker

830
00:38:53,350 --> 00:39:03,970
there so you know this is such a skill

831
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,680
it takes some practice and it's a lot

832
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:08,950
easier to do like with these guys in

833
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,040
competition if you can put the lock in a

834
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:13,540
vise and then you've really got some

835
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,120
ability to wiggle this key and make

836
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:19,660
marks on it but you can make a working

837
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:22,270
key doing it that way and to Lauren's

838
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:24,930
competitions doing this stuff I think

839
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,930
there's a video here

840
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,890
will it play

841
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:38,669
No all right well anyway spoiler alert

842
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:47,279
he does it a few times and files down

843
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:52,109
the key and the key works a lot of

844
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,309
systems in you know real facilities like

845
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:57,150
buildings stuff like that are mastered

846
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:58,770
so if you've ever wondered how master

847
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,829
keen works this the next bit will

848
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:03,720
explain it

849
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:06,240
mastering the point of doing it is so

850
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,890
that you can give everyone keys to their

851
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,479
own office but the cleaning staff can

852
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:10,890
get into all of them right or the

853
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,140
building manager can get into all of

854
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,368
them or different areas can have

855
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,558
different cleaning staff that can get

856
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:18,329
into all the rooms so you need a single

857
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,970
lock that will be opened by several

858
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:23,819
different keys and the way that works is

859
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:26,040
we introduce a new type of pin so we

860
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:28,829
have key pins we have driver pins and

861
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:34,490
now we have master pins which are

862
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:40,650
usually these little thin slice pins so

863
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:44,910
we can see here that a key that lifts

864
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:46,410
the key some of the key pins to the

865
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,819
right height and some of the key plus

866
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,009
master pins to the right height will

867
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:53,819
open the lock but for a get so for a

868
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:56,040
given stack you know we can open this

869
00:40:53,819 --> 00:41:00,029
unmastered one here on the right with a

870
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:03,660
single key that's cut to a 1/8 bidding

871
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:05,730
depth but if we put it if we could

872
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,490
convert that 8 to a 6 and a 2 for the

873
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:10,799
two master we can now open that with a

874
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:12,479
key that's cut to a depth of 8 like the

875
00:41:10,799 --> 00:41:17,190
original key or one that's cut to a

876
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:21,869
depth of 6 of that position the thing is

877
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:23,190
with mastering is that obviously it

878
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:25,730
makes the lock a little bit less secure

879
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:27,900
because more types of keys can open them

880
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:30,839
but it turns out actually makes the

881
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,609
system a lot less secure because we can

882
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:34,430
figure out if we have if we have a

883
00:41:32,609 --> 00:41:39,480
working key to a lock we can figure out

884
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:41,339
what the mastering depth is the master

885
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,990
bidding depth and so we can actually you

886
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:45,029
know this is a fun thing to do if you're

887
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:46,410
if you're bored at work and you work in

888
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,700
such a facilities you can figure

889
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:53,279
with the master key is for your own

890
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:56,609
office by getting by getting blanks and

891
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,080
then filing them down progressively to

892
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:00,630
figure out what exactly the master

893
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:03,299
bidding depth is so run through that so

894
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:07,170
if we we know that we have a four eight

895
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:10,380
four two six that opens it so now if we

896
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:13,110
get another one cut and you can go to a

897
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:15,480
locksmith and you at least in the US you

898
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:17,700
ask for a key cut to code so if you know

899
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,260
what type of key it is and you you know

900
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:22,169
the bidding depths you just tell them

901
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:24,120
that code four six four to six like you

902
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,320
say oh I don't want Ashley C cut to four

903
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:29,670
six four to six and I'll do it for you

904
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:31,680
as long as it's not a restricted key a

905
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:33,750
restricted blank key and oftentimes

906
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,049
they'll do it for you anyway

907
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:38,460
depends on the locksmith or of course

908
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:41,670
you can buy some blanks online you can

909
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,530
do it yourself but so we know our office

910
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:46,500
key is a four six four to six but we're

911
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:50,220
gonna cut ourselves a four zero four to

912
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:52,200
six and then we try it it doesn't work

913
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:54,450
we cut it down a little bit we try it it

914
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,490
doesn't work cut it down a little bit

915
00:42:54,450 --> 00:43:00,120
more in the two position still doesn't

916
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:01,919
work eventually we cut it down and it

917
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,710
opens so I guess I got the original key

918
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,930
was a four eight four to six but now we

919
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:09,320
know that four six four to six also

920
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:12,240
opens the lock and so we know there's a

921
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,550
height to master pin in the second

922
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:18,660
position in that lock and we can repeat

923
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:20,700
that for all the all the pin stacks in

924
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:22,379
our key and then we've got a master key

925
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,839
to the building and we can go and break

926
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:28,020
into everyone else's office cool

927
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,910
and that was originally published 2003

928
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:32,280
by Matt blaze lost the key lock

929
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:34,230
vulnerability and that this absolutely

930
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,730
works on any master key pin tumbler

931
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:39,369
system

932
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:41,770
as long as you do it right and you file

933
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:43,540
down you know get a get a vernier

934
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:48,099
caliper or a micrometer and you file

935
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:50,140
down to the correct differences in

936
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:53,079
bidding of your key which for a Schlage

937
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:56,078
is I think fifteen thousand seven inches

938
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:58,210
between adjacent numbers of bidding

939
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:02,829
depth but you can look it up to whatever

940
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:04,660
the type of lock that you have here is

941
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:07,770
just sort of an overview of different

942
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:09,879
types of picks if you go to one of these

943
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:13,750
corporate conferences which have

944
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:16,359
sponsors and vendors unlike balkon which

945
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:17,530
is more community oriented but many of

946
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:18,940
these conferences will have lockpick

947
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,740
vendors and stuff in the in the vendor

948
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:22,300
village and they'll you know sell these

949
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,859
sets and I have like 50 different types

950
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,390
of lock picks and you're like what the

951
00:44:23,859 --> 00:44:27,520
hell are all these good for I mostly

952
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:29,319
just use a half diamond well anyway

953
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,720
here's his what they're good for and you

954
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:34,000
can also of course get this stuff online

955
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:37,060
and you you know you'll get these

956
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,680
beginner sets advanced sets like master

957
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,940
sets we've got tons of lock picks and

958
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,220
it's like you know what do i what do I

959
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,810
use these all for any also it might be

960
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,328
made out of different stuff - they may

961
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:49,630
usually may have a spring steel which

962
00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:53,230
rusts probably about as common stainless

963
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:54,250
and then you know you can get your you

964
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,940
can pay a lot of money if you're a

965
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:59,560
titanium picks or whatever if you want

966
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:04,060
that regular stainless is is usually the

967
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:07,569
way to go and different thicknesses -

968
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:11,049
but if you're like really into this

969
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:12,910
stuff you might care and then you will

970
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:17,520
often see stuff design described as

971
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:19,868
standard profile or euro profile which

972
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,150
usually refers to the sort of shape of

973
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:24,760
the shoulder of the pick they're the one

974
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:27,160
place I care about that is I always get

975
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:29,710
a few euro tension tools because they

976
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,779
narrow down at the point where they go

977
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:36,430
into the key way and so often especially

978
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:39,010
with cheap padlocks there's that there's

979
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:41,440
often a very narrow space at the base of

980
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:43,900
the key way and the euros the euro

981
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:48,240
profile tension tools will fit in there

982
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:48,240
nicely whereas the normal ones won't

983
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:53,910
so here's lots of different types of

984
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:57,000
pics we saw these already and all the

985
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:59,600
demo animations these are the hooks and

986
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,830
you can get all kinds of different

987
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:07,500
shapes of hooks I would say mostly your

988
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:11,730
kit should probably include a short hook

989
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:13,200
and a medium hook the difference that

990
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:16,890
you care about in hook length is when

991
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,390
you're reaching past pins that are not

992
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:19,680
binding and you want to lift a pin

993
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:22,470
that's just binding sometimes you want a

994
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:27,000
longer cook and sometimes you don't this

995
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:31,140
depends on the lock so you know typical

996
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:34,070
and awesome the descriptions there if

997
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:36,839
the short hook and the gonzo hook

998
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:38,220
I've never purchased the guns the hook

999
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,800
I've never even seen them in the place I

1000
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:46,589
buy pics from but along a long hook is

1001
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:48,420
useful we have these also reach tools

1002
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:49,860
you know forgetting past when you're

1003
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:54,330
dealing with locks with a lot of pin

1004
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:57,940
stacks then your diamonds you can also

1005
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:59,779
get different different shapes mostly a

1006
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:02,220
[Music]

1007
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,990
standard sort of studying kit we'll just

1008
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,990
have ones one size of diamond that's

1009
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:08,640
usually enough and it seems to be no

1010
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,229
real point to having a diamond on both

1011
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:14,339
sides because then you can't use it to

1012
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:18,120
count pin stacks and you can get these

1013
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:20,280
ones that are sort of offset so again to

1014
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,509
help you reach past and into the back of

1015
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:26,640
the lock when you're getting getting

1016
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:29,090
past them some pins that are in the way

1017
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,089
in the front

1018
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:36,150
then these ball profile which is you

1019
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:38,040
know sort of like a in my opinion sort

1020
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:40,980
of like a diamond but maybe less useful

1021
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:44,340
I didn't know this says Ken this says

1022
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:47,430
the Snowman can be useful but I didn't

1023
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:51,900
really know when I never really found a

1024
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:53,399
good use case for those that's just you

1025
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,830
know when I when I get a kit that's got

1026
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,480
these in them I usually just like now

1027
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:59,400
either never use them or just take them

1028
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,840
and take them out to save space but

1029
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,840
maybe maybe some people find them useful

1030
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:12,390
these yeah raking tools many many

1031
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:14,910
different types of rakes so you'll

1032
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:18,779
normally get like a C rake in any

1033
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:23,250
beginner kit and you know you're raking

1034
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:25,050
action I don't personally tend to have a

1035
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:28,980
lot of success with the with a standard

1036
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:30,570
the standard rakes but I don't know I'll

1037
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:32,430
show another one that I like better in a

1038
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:34,890
sec one thing to look for like you can

1039
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:37,049
see this one if them if a lot of metal

1040
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:39,540
has been cut out of the pick itself

1041
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:41,700
eventually you might be left with a

1042
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:43,770
weakness that can snap off inside the

1043
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,879
lock and then your that kind of really

1044
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:46,230
sucks because now you've got this piece

1045
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,750
of metal jammed in the lock that's very

1046
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:51,150
very difficult to retrieve and if you're

1047
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:52,350
you know violating the rules and picking

1048
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:54,240
a lock you don't know and then the owner

1049
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:56,160
is gonna find that that key doesn't work

1050
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,330
anymore and because there's a piece of

1051
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,710
metal stuck in lock and they're gonna be

1052
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:03,660
know that someone's been messing around

1053
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:07,730
with their lock these are the types of

1054
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:10,890
like lifter rakes that I really like and

1055
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:13,980
so the difference here is you know you

1056
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:15,450
normally just wiggling this in and out

1057
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,850
more or less maybe at a different angle

1058
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:19,859
with a rake but with a lifting tool you

1059
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:21,569
sort of like lifting all the pins at the

1060
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:28,020
same time as you do it

1061
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:29,850
and so this el rake is other ones that I

1062
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:32,040
really like or at least I use I think I

1063
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:33,720
feel like I have more success you're not

1064
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,880
being scientific about this or anything

1065
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,560
I just use use it for a while and see

1066
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,960
what happens but I feel like I have more

1067
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:44,279
success with an El rake than with us

1068
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:46,440
see rake so eat you Kitt's done off

1069
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,059
don't always come with an L rake in them

1070
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:51,450
that I always buy one separately and put

1071
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:54,630
it into a kit because I tried it I keep

1072
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:58,379
a kid in every backpack so I've always

1073
00:49:54,630 --> 00:50:00,089
got a set with me and you know

1074
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:03,569
individual picks are actually really

1075
00:50:00,089 --> 00:50:05,730
cheap so you can just get a basic set

1076
00:50:03,569 --> 00:50:09,049
and then add one of your one or two of

1077
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:09,049
your favorite individual picks to them

1078
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,950
these I've never seen in person the king

1079
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:17,279
and the queen so I have nothing to say

1080
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:18,899
about them but one of these ones that

1081
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,569
people really really like in the Loch

1082
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:24,990
sport world of the so-called Bogota

1083
00:50:21,569 --> 00:50:27,720
rakes which I guess were developed by a

1084
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:31,098
Colombian guy Raymundo and so these

1085
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:37,680
things are sort of like in-between a

1086
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:41,549
rake and a lifter and they started off

1087
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:44,190
as a kind kind of jiggler tools and you

1088
00:50:41,549 --> 00:50:49,140
can get various types of jigglers too

1089
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:52,680
from vendors of lockpicks and what you

1090
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:54,299
basically do with them it's sort of

1091
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,950
in-between what you do with the rake and

1092
00:50:54,299 --> 00:50:57,509
with a lifter you sort of put these

1093
00:50:55,950 --> 00:51:02,879
things in there and you just wiggle them

1094
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:05,099
around and you they usually sold in sets

1095
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,540
of jiggler tools and so you'll try one

1096
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:08,400
and wiggle it a bit and if it doesn't

1097
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,720
work you try another one again you're

1098
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,790
sort of playing the odds you're doing

1099
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,529
the probability of like if I if I just

1100
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:16,319
like manipulate these pins enough

1101
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:17,520
eventually it'll open but you know some

1102
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:21,690
people really swear by them and if you

1103
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:24,059
like lock yourself out and get a

1104
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:25,440
locksmith and you and the locksmith

1105
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:27,540
doesn't drill you a lock right away and

1106
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,799
replace it it's very very common the

1107
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,089
locksmith will come with some gigolo

1108
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:31,650
tools and that's kind of the first thing

1109
00:51:30,089 --> 00:51:33,470
they'll do is try jigglers on your house

1110
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:36,119
you know you've got some low security

1111
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,379
Fyffe pinched leg on your you know a

1112
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:39,059
quick set on your house

1113
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:40,530
the locksmith it's most likely gonna

1114
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:43,049
come along with a gigolo tool and just

1115
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:45,359
try that for a while before drilling out

1116
00:51:43,049 --> 00:51:49,259
of your lock

1117
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:50,640
so these Bogota rakes you know sort of

1118
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,590
owe something to the jigglers too and

1119
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,560
they look basically like this

1120
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:57,750
and I actually don't have any of these I

1121
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:01,740
think maybe some maybe a couple of my

1122
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:04,890
kits came with one in there but I

1123
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:07,379
haven't used them a lot but the locks

1124
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:10,819
book people like really like him so I

1125
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,820
didn't try them out see what you think

1126
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:22,710
how we doing for time all right this let

1127
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:24,660
me see what's here there's a whole bunch

1128
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:26,820
of stuff here I'm like looking for tool

1129
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:31,080
marks unlocks I guess I'll do it just

1130
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:33,510
for just the fun but I'll take time for

1131
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:36,690
questions too or you can talk to me

1132
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:37,860
afterwards as well so this this is just

1133
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:39,570
kind of interesting this is not

1134
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:40,950
something unless unless you work in law

1135
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:42,510
enforcement or whatever you probably

1136
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:44,700
would never see any of the stuff but it

1137
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:47,250
to me it's just interesting that you can

1138
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,779
see if you like really look at pins

1139
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:52,950
whether or not they've been picked in

1140
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:55,400
how so when you get a pin from the

1141
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:58,620
manufacturer you know some like little

1142
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,720
high speed lathe machine has made those

1143
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:03,560
picks in his left tool marks on it most

1144
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:06,870
likely concentric circles like that and

1145
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:08,610
you know so you can you can see how it

1146
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:10,680
was when it was first made and then as

1147
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:12,420
that's used to be you know in the lock

1148
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,830
and legitimately unlock you know got

1149
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,140
you've got a key rubbing across its face

1150
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:17,490
twice every time the lock gets open at

1151
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:21,450
least twice because it goes in and goes

1152
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:24,200
out and so you can sort of see how these

1153
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:26,899
thing how these tool marks wear away as

1154
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:30,660
the key is legitimately used in the lock

1155
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:32,610
now similarly the plug is scraping

1156
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:35,520
against those spring-loaded driver pins

1157
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:37,320
every time it turns so you can see what

1158
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,509
happens to a plug after it's been used a

1159
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:42,600
lot of times and these are all sort of

1160
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:46,230
predictable marks from normal use but

1161
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:48,029
picks go to places the keys don't the

1162
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:49,350
key is mostly touching the bottom of the

1163
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:52,920
pin every time that a pick can reach

1164
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:55,049
around and scrape the side of it so we

1165
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,150
can see interesting marks on here that

1166
00:53:55,050 --> 00:54:02,810
may be subject to normal wear and tear

1167
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:02,810
so if you look just there

1168
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,470
there's a mark on there that would never

1169
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:10,770
be caused by a regular key operation of

1170
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:10,770
the lock

1171
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:18,500
so here here are some examples of the

1172
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:19,700
kinds of mocks and again this is what I

1173
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,650
was saying every time you pick your lock

1174
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:23,240
you're doing a little bit of damage and

1175
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:25,790
you can see when you when you're picking

1176
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:27,649
often little tiny flakes of bras come

1177
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:32,480
out because brass is a soft metal it's

1178
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:34,849
easily scratched by the pic so you know

1179
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:39,170
if they you got marks all the way across

1180
00:54:34,849 --> 00:54:41,480
the face from a rake mixed picking there

1181
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:43,820
and you know this is this is why you

1182
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,800
don't want to you know practice on other

1183
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:47,420
people's locks and upset them because

1184
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:50,240
eventually you're really gonna wear down

1185
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:52,970
the the pin and sooner or later it might

1186
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,830
not open especially if you're the

1187
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:56,750
legitimate key has been is multi

1188
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:59,630
multiple generations from the original

1189
00:54:56,750 --> 00:55:02,690
key and so every time it's been cut as a

1190
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:04,970
copy a little bit more era is introduced

1191
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:06,260
and you know probably many of us have

1192
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:08,930
experienced the case where we've had a

1193
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:10,369
key that previously worked now it's

1194
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,450
sticky and doesn't quite work right and

1195
00:55:10,369 --> 00:55:13,339
you got a wiggler when you get in there

1196
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:14,868
because it was it was never really

1197
00:55:13,339 --> 00:55:19,670
perfect to begin with and things have

1198
00:55:14,869 --> 00:55:24,410
worn down a little bit the the snap of

1199
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:26,150
guns which you know this this is just a

1200
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:27,970
total bypass tool there's no skill in it

1201
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:30,530
so the Loch sport people don't like them

1202
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:33,410
but they're whacking the hell out of the

1203
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:38,089
pins and so you can see these snap gun

1204
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:39,589
marks on the pins and then especially

1205
00:55:38,089 --> 00:55:41,029
when you're beginning you sometimes you

1206
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:42,619
know you don't know where the last pins

1207
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,359
are and sometimes you'll really Jam the

1208
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:46,220
the pic in and scrape the back so you

1209
00:55:44,359 --> 00:55:51,440
can find tool marks on the back of the

1210
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:52,910
keyway and also like I said right right

1211
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,950
right when we're talking about tension

1212
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:56,720
tools if someone's putting too much

1213
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:58,580
downward pressure they can scrape the

1214
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,680
bottom of the key way and you can see

1215
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:02,930
that too and then also if people are

1216
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,910
trying to force the lock of course you

1217
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:11,210
know you'll see some tool marks like

1218
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:13,609
that the bump keys these are you know

1219
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:16,430
alleged to be bump key marks I'm not

1220
00:56:13,609 --> 00:56:18,259
sure if you you know

1221
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:19,730
I guess if you were friends a police

1222
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:22,970
forensics guy you might be able to spot

1223
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:26,920
these and and and say yeah that was

1224
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:26,919
definitely a bump key maybe

1225
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,930
see what's left

1226
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,440
all right I'll play this stuff anyway

1227
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:42,310
okay the things of some of the resources

1228
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:44,650
for for learning more so practical

1229
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:46,570
lock-picking deviant hollom is the guy

1230
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:48,760
who did most of these slides I think

1231
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:53,200
certainly all the key animations deviant

1232
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:54,610
did deviant also will thanked him

1233
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,500
yesterday in his elevator freaking talk

1234
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:58,390
he gave him a lot of head start stuff on

1235
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:01,840
the elevator freakin so deviant school

1236
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:02,500
in his book has a lot of this stuff in

1237
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:06,700
it

1238
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:08,800
Marc Weber Tobias is sort of one of the

1239
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:10,240
guys who's written the most books on

1240
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,350
locks and safes and stuff like that

1241
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,140
there's a whole bunch of stuff out there

1242
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:16,420
and he's also given a number of long

1243
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,710
talks at hacker conferences so you can

1244
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:21,910
look up his stuff if you want to see

1245
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:24,460
some really in-depth things and then of

1246
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:27,490
course the tool websites there's a guy

1247
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,980
actually on the in some of the videos

1248
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:31,779
there's this guy the lock-picking lawyer

1249
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:33,370
and he does some really good YouTube

1250
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:35,890
videos where he'll take some sort of

1251
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:39,910
lock you know whatever it is per video

1252
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:41,170
and do a do a careful deep dive into how

1253
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:44,100
it works and how to pick it stuff like

1254
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:47,320
that I like his videos a lot

1255
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:52,630
yeah the tool websites and the deviant

1256
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:54,340
site is deviating done that blah blah

1257
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:59,650
blah yeah legal questions or something

1258
00:57:54,340 --> 00:58:02,110
maybe you should look into is this

1259
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:04,390
really varies by by country and by state

1260
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:06,850
whether or not lock picks a call a

1261
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:08,379
considered burglary tools so in the

1262
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:12,580
United States I think it varies by state

1263
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:14,680
but usually then not a Berglas toll and

1264
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:17,890
last year using them in a burglary so

1265
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:20,350
funny story just this week there's some

1266
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:23,799
penetration test is for a company that

1267
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:27,130
friends of mine work for they did they

1268
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:31,690
were doing an assessment on a on a court

1269
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:33,480
house and they were that they're they're

1270
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:35,590
like scope of work said they needed to

1271
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,570
figure out if there's anyone any way

1272
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:40,180
that someone could get the court records

1273
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:42,130
but the court house thought that they

1274
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,140
meant just electronically right just

1275
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:45,550
like hacking over the Internet but these

1276
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,598
guys thought it was a full scope of work

1277
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:48,880
so they broke into

1278
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:51,099
courthouse and then they set off an

1279
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,200
alarm what everyone were caught and so

1280
00:58:51,099 --> 00:58:56,890
then they were put in prison and charged

1281
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:59,529
with burglary and possession of burglary

1282
00:58:56,890 --> 00:59:01,629
tools presumably by lockpicks and stuff

1283
00:58:59,529 --> 00:59:03,279
and so you know we don't know yet if

1284
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:05,410
they'll if that they'll keep pressing

1285
00:59:03,279 --> 00:59:07,150
charges because they really were you

1286
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:08,769
know hired to do it but the people who

1287
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:12,489
hide them didn't realize when they said

1288
00:59:08,769 --> 00:59:13,868
find any way to get you know get get the

1289
00:59:12,489 --> 00:59:15,609
records that they were gonna actually

1290
00:59:13,869 --> 00:59:17,650
physically break into the courthouse so

1291
00:59:15,609 --> 00:59:19,089
if you do penetration testing work make

1292
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:21,910
sure you've got all your scope of work

1293
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:25,239
fully signed off on and check your local

1294
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:27,098
laws because some places in Australia

1295
00:59:25,239 --> 00:59:29,109
for example the people often ask me if I

1296
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:30,819
ever been hassled for carrying lockpicks

1297
00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:33,220
when I fly because I always carry them

1298
00:59:30,819 --> 00:59:34,450
and the answer is twice and they were

1299
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:38,470
both those times were both in Australia

1300
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:43,899
I was hassled at the airport and in

1301
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:46,720
Australia pics considered burglars tools

1302
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:48,069
if you're not a locksmith but what does

1303
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,450
it mean to be a locksmith so I you know

1304
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:51,489
I said of the guy at the airport the

1305
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:52,660
second time I'm like what yes when

1306
00:59:51,489 --> 00:59:54,039
someone asks you if he locks me if you

1307
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,430
say yes right I mean that's the right

1308
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:56,349
answer

1309
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:57,729
so I said yes and he said can you prove

1310
00:59:56,349 --> 00:59:59,589
it and I said what do you how do you

1311
00:59:57,729 --> 01:00:00,759
want me to prove it there's no locksmith

1312
00:59:59,589 --> 01:00:04,269
license and he's like well you have a

1313
01:00:00,759 --> 01:00:05,410
business card and I said no but and so

1314
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:06,788
he made me check them but then I went

1315
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:09,249
home and I had some business cards made

1316
01:00:06,789 --> 01:00:11,950
that said locksmith on them so I haven't

1317
01:00:09,249 --> 01:00:13,828
I haven't had to try those yet but I

1318
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:17,499
think it'll work

1319
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:18,910
so check your local laws yeah all right

1320
01:00:17,499 --> 01:00:24,328
I think that's enough I think I think

1321
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:24,328
time's up yeah any any questions

1322
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:28,230
yeah

1323
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:32,369
sighs Oh

1324
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:47,869
yeah I mean most pin tumbler locks they

1325
01:00:45,469 --> 01:00:49,999
are not accessible from both sides so

1326
01:00:47,869 --> 01:00:51,440
the question was what if there's a key

1327
01:00:49,999 --> 01:00:52,819
stuck in the lock from the other side

1328
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,069
and you're trying to open it can you

1329
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:57,499
push it out in pin in the case of pin

1330
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:59,180
tumbler locks it's not common to be able

1331
01:00:57,499 --> 01:01:00,890
to put a key in from both sides because

1332
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:06,259
the same the key would have to be

1333
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:07,729
symmetrical you you know in order for

1334
01:01:06,259 --> 01:01:09,410
the same key to work on both sides but

1335
01:01:07,729 --> 01:01:12,109
they do there are these ones that you

1336
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:14,029
get in China I think there's a slide

1337
01:01:12,109 --> 01:01:16,190
here that's got a picture one can you

1338
01:01:14,029 --> 01:01:18,739
see if I can quickly find it where

1339
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:20,239
they'll have two sets of pins and you

1340
01:01:18,739 --> 01:01:22,160
can unlock it from one side of the other

1341
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:24,309
in that case you can't reach from one to

1342
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:27,739
the other you can't push that key out

1343
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:28,969
but if the key is in place the lock it's

1344
01:01:27,739 --> 01:01:31,339
not going to stop the lock from turning

1345
01:01:28,969 --> 01:01:33,769
the exception leo is the old-school

1346
01:01:31,339 --> 01:01:39,109
warded keys you know like you know the

1347
01:01:33,769 --> 01:01:42,379
sort of classic I can't have a key you

1348
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:46,190
know where it's got like big handle or

1349
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:49,009
the thing in these kind of wards on one

1350
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:52,160
side it was common for them to be able

1351
01:01:49,009 --> 01:01:54,589
to be used in both sides and one way

1352
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,420
that people were warned if you have that

1353
01:01:54,589 --> 01:01:57,650
kind of key on your you know a hotel

1354
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,759
room door or whatever in your sleep

1355
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:01,069
don't leave the key in the lock because

1356
01:01:58,759 --> 01:02:02,569
someone can push it out and put some

1357
01:02:01,069 --> 01:02:04,369
paper under the door and catch it and

1358
01:02:02,569 --> 01:02:05,779
then like bring it out of the door but

1359
01:02:04,369 --> 01:02:08,180
you know that no one uses those keys

1360
01:02:05,779 --> 01:02:09,940
anymore maybe maybe an Africa or

1361
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:12,049
something I don't know

1362
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:15,330
let me see if I can find the picture of

1363
01:02:12,049 --> 01:02:17,820
this Chinese

1364
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:20,480
style locks right was in the impression

1365
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:20,480

[Music]

1367
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:40,490
so this is this is the one that I'm

1368
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,629
talking about where you have two

1369
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:47,450
separate cylinders and the latch in the

1370
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:49,640
middle when the when the cylinder

1371
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:51,350
rotates that piece of metal in the

1372
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:54,230
middle is what actuates the latch that

1373
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:56,380
you know opens the door and so those

1374
01:02:54,230 --> 01:03:01,130
cylinders are the same on both sides

1375
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:04,460
with the exception there's there's it's

1376
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:06,170
a whole talk in itself and this guy gave

1377
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:07,100
it at def con China this year so you'll

1378
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:10,850
be able to look up the video if you're

1379
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:12,319
interested guys names Lucas he did a

1380
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:13,490
whole presentation on Chinese locks and

1381
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,740
they do a lot of interesting things like

1382
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:19,069
there's a kind that they make where they

1383
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:20,390
call construction locks so these these

1384
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:23,090
are lock you'd put on your house when

1385
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:27,379
the construction person is working on it

1386
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:29,360
and when they leave you sort of reset

1387
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:30,950
the you know you use your lock to your

1388
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:33,410
key to reset it so that they can't get

1389
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:34,850
in anymore and so they're these kind of

1390
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:36,230
they be not to change the lock so

1391
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:37,520
they're designed to be installed the

1392
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:39,410
construction guy uses it and then when

1393
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:42,710
you use your key on it it resets the

1394
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:43,819
lock just to your key and so yeah a lot

1395
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:45,530
of a lot of these really interesting

1396
