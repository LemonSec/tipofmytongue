1
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:32,090
next up we have coercion Harry teaching

2
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:39,860
us about the beginning things of CDF

3
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:43,430
thank you hello everybody to our

4
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:46,040
talkback on beginner CTF introduction so

5
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:50,269
we have or all you so first we'll talk

6
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:52,700
about what is CTF then we will show you

7
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,460
the two kinds of CTF styles that

8
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,019
jeopardy and attack defense and then the

9
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,839
last topic is like the Balkan beginner

10
00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:02,809
suggest we organize for you so who we

11
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:05,929
are we are students at Tim Vienna both

12
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:09,729
of us we are playing at the CTF team of

13
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:12,290
the University called we own you and

14
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:13,880
thanks to the SPI research that is

15
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,690
hosting our infrastructure where the

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:22,240
mostess services are running so I will

17
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:27,710
give the crushed F part what is the CTF

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:30,199
hi so when you think of C CTF or capture

19
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:34,039
the flag you probably think of some

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,740
shooter games we just have to shoot the

21
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,080
enemies and kept to the flag for us it's

22
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,020
a bit different when we talk about

23
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,270
capture the flag we mean internet

24
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,640
security competitions where we solve

25
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,780
some challenges and find some flag and

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,890
the flag is usually just a text string

27
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:58,280
the proofs that you solve the challenge

28
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:00,380
why is this fun because you can manage

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,690
to play in a team and you can challenge

30
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:07,699
yourself on internet security challenges

31
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:09,590
there's also global ranking and overview

32
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,910
where you can compare teams of different

33
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,569
countries

34
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:16,849
it's called CTF time it's also basically

35
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:19,069
a central hub where CTFs are announced

36
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:20,540
for example the Falcon beginner CTF is

37
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:23,929
not announced there because it's not

38
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,760
exactly public but if you ever want to

39
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,209
play a CTF you can just look it up at

40
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,640
CTF time and check it out and you'll

41
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:38,880
probably find a CTF every other week so

42
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:41,549
there's no shortage of CTS there so what

43
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:46,350
does playing CTF look like from our

44
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,790
perspective when you look at hacking in

45
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,500
the movies it's like oh okay

46
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,799
I'm gonna hack this and 10 seconds later

47
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:56,160
everything blows out and when you look

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,500
at reality it's mostly just one person

49
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,770
sitting in front of a PC staring at the

50
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,470
screen then you think okay I might be

51
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:09,120
able to exploit this then you think okay

52
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:11,850
no that's not gonna work so you're gonna

53
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,890
play CTFs in a team then there are two

54
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,859
people sitting there you're gonna stare

55
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,440
the screen together and do you think you

56
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,290
could do that you'll find out that won't

57
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,340
work but your colleague might have an

58
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:29,010
idea and if you play CTF online for the

59
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:33,170
first time it's probably gonna be pretty

60
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,170
frustrating if you don't know what to do

61
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,920
so there's basically two distinct styles

62
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,030
of CDF's

63
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,339
with minor variations available one of

64
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,700
them is jeopardy the other one is a tech

65
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,700
defense

66
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,720
property is the most common form of

67
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,090
CDF's mainly because it's very easy to

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:59,070
organize or easier to organize an attack

69
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,360
defense it gives you have basically a

70
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,070
list of challenges in different

71
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,900
categories you pick your favorite

72
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,190
category you work on a challenge you

73
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,959
solve it you get the flag and then

74
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,459
you're done you have a flag this

75
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:14,010
challenge is solved you won't have to

76
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:19,829
solve it again and it usually takes 48

77
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:22,099
hours or up about 48 hours the different

78
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:25,890
categories are usually pawn which is

79
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:30,300
exploitation mostly binary exploitation

80
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:33,440
but exploitation in general reversing

81
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,110
where you either reverse binaries or

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:41,190
weird file formats that aren't very

83
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,860
common web challenges where you exploit

84
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,730
web services

85
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,650
forensics and mists misc with forensics

86
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:53,080
mostly falls in the category of

87
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:55,729
reversing and miss can be any challenge

88
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,710
can be completely unrelated can

89
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,740
contribute to trivia questions for

90
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:03,169
example or flex and sharpen for self and

91
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,690
Internet or it might be not even

92
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:09,680
security related for example we had one

93
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:13,160
challenge at the second CTF where there

94
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,870
was a nine hour video and basically you

95
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,530
had to find the flag in the nine hour

96
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:20,570
video so we thought maybe it's just one

97
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,929
frame in the nine hour video but instead

98
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:27,740
of one frame it was a blinking light

99
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,810
that bottom corner and it was a webcam

100
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,930
of Tokyo so someone had to go up there

101
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:36,970
every hour and turn on the light or turn

102
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:40,310
off the light to produce Morse code flag

103
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:42,500
but they forgot that it would that the

104
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,090
Sun would rise eventually certain idea

105
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,110
they had to improvise and open the

106
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,940
window and close the window we basically

107
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,540
were just sitting there with post-its on

108
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,620
the screen so we can have the region

109
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,540
isolated with the light going on and

110
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,820
often just sat there and decoded the

111
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:03,140
Morse code which was pretty painful but

112
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:05,450
still a fun challenge yeah in jeopardy

113
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:08,210
once you solve a challenge you get the

114
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:10,270
flag and once you get the flag you won't

115
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:13,010
have to look at the challenge anymore

116
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,289
and compared to attack defense CPS

117
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,330
because attack-defence CTF is usually

118
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:21,140
are shorter in a time range of about 8

119
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:23,780
hours and japanese-style CDF's are in

120
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,039
the time range of 48 hours that gives

121
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,229
you a lot more time to solve the

122
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,910
assaulted challenges and that means the

123
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,910
challenges are also pretty mounting

124
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,900
recent CTS for example the Chaos

125
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,409
Communication claps if they have set

126
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,409
camp or

127
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,800
at Congress are notorious for their

128
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,989
zero-day categories where you have to

129
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,169
use actual zero days or find actual zero

130
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,280
days to solve the challenge it hasn't

131
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:52,680
always been this way

132
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,349
there used to be easier sit yes but now

133
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,850
it's all about going getting more

134
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:01,620
complicated and producing harder

135
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:05,250
challenges a small example challenge

136
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,470
from this year's Def Con qualifier CTF a

137
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,590
challenge I worked on and like this we

138
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,910
basically had given a small OS partner

139
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,888
and we could perform some basic

140
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:18,210
functions like it was an interactive

141
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:20,580
shell where we kept list the files and

142
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:24,530
we could catch some files and it had

143
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,530
basic support for environment variables

144
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:34,919
we know there was one file that we

145
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:37,610
couldn't leak and we had to find a way

146
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:41,460
how to leak it it was called honcho and

147
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:44,820
we couldn't just cat it because it was

148
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:47,370
forbidden in the code so we had to

149
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:51,300
somehow find a way to circumvent to

150
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,830
check in the car after reverse

151
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,780
engineering we found out that

152
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:58,620
environment variables were stored in a

153
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:01,020
simple data structure for the values of

154
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,470
the environment variables it was

155
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,599
basically just an array of pointers

156
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:09,240
which put points to the memory location

157
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:13,950
where the value of the environment

158
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,840
variable was stored now what was

159
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:18,360
interesting was that you could do a

160
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,659
variable expansion with a dollar sign

161
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,690
just as you could in actual bash or an

162
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:27,150
actual environment variables but unlike

163
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,729
with the normal environment variables

164
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,669
this wouldn't result in a length check

165
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:34,890
so you could basically just take one

166
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:37,199
really long variable and then create

167
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:40,650
another variable and use the dollar sign

168
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,300
to expand into this variable and the

169
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,098
expanded variable would just override

170
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,520
the balance check and produce a heap

171
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,520
overflow

172
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:54,079
fortunately this was pretty simple

173
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:58,100
because right after the heap

174
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,200
there was this array of pointers so if

175
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,570
you managed to put a chunk right at the

176
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,610
end of the heap and then overwrite the

177
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,760
environment variable you could write

178
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:10,160
into this array of pointers and then

179
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,200
basically get an arbitrary read because

180
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,959
he could many clear the point in any way

181
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:19,310
you want it and read and write at every

182
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:21,589
place in the memory now what it is look

183
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:26,989
in real time it basically was five hours

184
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:31,250
of painful heap layout creation which

185
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:34,700
resulted in some drunken drawings on the

186
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:39,380
whiteboard in the end we actually solved

187
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:41,839
if we thought but what we only managed

188
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,209
to dump was the honcho file which was

189
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,430
basically a hypervisor that ran the

190
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:48,199
kernel and the flag was outside of the

191
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,540
hypervisor so this was actually a second

192
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,390
stage which couldn't have been that bad

193
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,189
but the hypervisor ran on OSX and none

194
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,689
of us had a Mac or any maxixe beer

195
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,950
making experience whatsoever

196
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:03,200
so we basically spent 12 hours

197
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:05,180
exploiting this challenge but didn't

198
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,709
solve it in the end but we still have

199
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:14,599
fun well then then there is the attack

200
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:17,869
defense category the biggest difference

201
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,240
is that there are no challenges but our

202
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,450
services service is like a web servers

203
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,660
or some ftp server whatever that is

204
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:28,760
running and each - each team has their

205
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:32,029
own server with running services

206
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,760
normally have like around 8 6 6 to 8

207
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:38,480
services during attack defense is DF and

208
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:43,100
each team has the same service with the

209
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:46,670
same data and a room is like I have the

210
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,770
same databases and normally it's like 8

211
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,349
hours long I mean they're all so there

212
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:55,130
wasn't a day that went 24 hours attack

213
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:57,290
defense it was really a tough time some

214
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,810
guys - team didn't even sleep today

215
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:04,040
heck the whole time 24 hours they were

216
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:07,609
really broken afterwards and like that

217
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:11,149
the play time is split in two ticks

218
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:14,540
around like one tick is around five

219
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:20,329
minutes and in this tick multiple things

220
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:23,180
happen so let's see how it works so in

221
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:26,599
one tick the game bot distributes the

222
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:29,449
flags to all the services then the teams

223
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,000
run automated exploits or manual

224
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:34,519
exploits so if you have some really hard

225
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,240
service value or is it hard to like

226
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:40,160
automate it sometimes team just manually

227
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,069
exploit the service to get like first

228
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,810
first blood whatever and then the first

229
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,550
third thing is that the game would

230
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:51,829
checks whether the disability flag is

231
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:53,329
still there unlike that says okay the

232
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:56,000
service is still running and is fine

233
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:59,479
yeah if some flag is missing in the

234
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,579
service then you will get some points

235
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,980
removed from the score because there is

236
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:05,689
SL a service level agreement score and

237
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,660
this one is criest

238
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:11,690
and so the thing is also sometimes our

239
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:14,000
services where the team finds exploits

240
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,769
that they can delete flags so they

241
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,690
exploit the service get your flag and

242
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:20,029
deletes it so the other teams won't get

243
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,620
any flags and you get even points

244
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:24,470
reduced because the flag of debate about

245
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,899
our teams so the ideas in the end that

246
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:31,310
you steal the flags for other teams and

247
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:34,069
pet your own service so houses in

248
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:36,649
pictures so you have you have a big

249
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:39,050
network and there is the orga part of

250
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:43,209
network with the game bots and the whole

251
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:46,699
network is put together with VPNs and

252
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:48,888
then there is like team one they have

253
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:50,660
also a VPN connection to the team or

254
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:52,279
Gannett work and there is the

255
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,500
vulnerability box that's the box with

256
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,600
all the services running and there are

257
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,329
other clients well normally you

258
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,519
shouldn't like add these clients or

259
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:04,069
acted to the to the VPN because it will

260
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,810
also be probably attacked so normally

261
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:08,630
you don't really connect the clients to

262
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,489
the VPN directly only the boom box but

263
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,020
you can do it but probably if you have

264
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,000
that lack the other teams will attack

265
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:17,300
your personal computers so not

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,589
recommended and of course also other

267
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:24,229
teams like team to free mm and so the

268
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:25,910
first in the first round yet the wool

269
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,770
box and they're just different services

270
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,199
running on one box and that can be

271
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:33,370
really there can be a web server some

272
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:36,230
binary that is running with the service

273
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,970
so there's really different all of them

274
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,180
really obscure languages that are

275
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:43,430
compiled to something some flask service

276
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:46,089
so it's really the whole range of

277
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:49,939
service it can run on on this boom box

278
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:52,209
so in one game tick so we call it game

279
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:55,010
to kicks the first thing is that the

280
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:57,410
game bot deploys the flags to the

281
00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:02,870
services so there is every time this one

282
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:06,770
like API or one one thing how he can

283
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:08,480
deploy the flags to the service and it

284
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:11,060
can be like some API or it can be like

285
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,070
that he creates a count on a service and

286
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,949
stores the flag in you know data field

287
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:20,510
of this account so it depends on the

288
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:22,370
service how it stores the flag then well

289
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,500
then the wrote then the team start to

290
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:28,209
exploit the other services of other

291
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,410
teams and steal the flags of them and

292
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:31,969
then they submitted to the game server

293
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:36,319
there is some API where you can submit

294
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:38,120
all the Flex you've got and then in a

295
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,520
same tick and the end the both also

296
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,709
checks if the flags are still there if

297
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,640
some service is reachable if the service

298
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:49,939
is working one thing is order to know

299
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:52,220
that normally flags are only valid for

300
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:54,829
like 5 ticks so if they have all their

301
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,930
flags that are from 5 a lighter older

302
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:58,969
than 5 ticks they are normally not

303
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,680
accepted by the game but its attack

304
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,660
defense so they're only like only 5

305
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:07,310
ticks are valid the flags that you catch

306
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:10,100
from other servers so that's like one

307
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:14,119
thing about one the explanation of ticks

308
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:16,690
in CAPTCHA flags and the other the major

309
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:20,150
thing is it's not just only the

310
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:22,880
exploitation of services but also how

311
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,840
you play this like the gameplay because

312
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,580
in

313
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,430
you played as a team you need an

314
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,440
infrastructure so some city some CTF

315
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,479
organizers give you a virtual server on

316
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,300
a network so you don't need to have own

317
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,210
infrastructure and some CTF so just

318
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,550
provide you our VirtualBox image and you

319
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,590
need to have your own computer to run it

320
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:46,040
and to set up the network so it depends

321
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:49,220
on the CTF and how the team will react

322
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,500
like everybody can read the network

323
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,480
traffic so if you attack other teams

324
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:57,920
they can check out the traffic and see

325
00:15:53,480 --> 00:16:00,860
what we're doing so in the end if you

326
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,630
have a like a bad exploit they can read

327
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,310
exploit what you did on it on it in a

328
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,560
traffic and they can just be played for

329
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:09,469
example or also exploit if your exploit

330
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:14,660
other teams so why are fact is a really

331
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:20,300
important tool and at this kind of CTF

332
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:23,000
and others of course a rule set for for

333
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:27,170
CTF and all that the gameplay is also

334
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,780
then depends on the rule set and yeah

335
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:34,010
also as in real life there are no 100%

336
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:37,490
fair rules and also you need to enjoy

337
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:39,830
the game and sometimes it also happens

338
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,440
that sometimes teams breaches the rule

339
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:46,370
and and also get punished so one time

340
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,200
one team DDoS the whole network and the

341
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:52,340
whole city effort broke down at the end

342
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,450
and the consequences was that the team

343
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,570
got disqualified

344
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,130
it was first place and it tried to DDoS

345
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,530
one team and in the end the DDoS the

346
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:04,670
whole network the whole CTF network

347
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:06,950
break down they got disqualified and the

348
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:09,470
organizers made a really cool write up

349
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,520
what happened and how they found that

350
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,480
this this team was

351
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:17,119
DDoS the network we have some examples

352
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,910
of online attack-defence CTF today's

353
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,958
Russia TV it's a Russian CTF it's a

354
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,820
pretty stable

355
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:27,650
TTFN it's is done every year and it's

356
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:31,250
hostile towards end of the year like

357
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:33,920
December November in this area then

358
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,650
there is AI CTF also known as the

359
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,530
cottage picture well it's

360
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:42,200
it's a really good CTF it sometimes

361
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:44,320
really caught Dickens in some parts of

362
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,910
organization or during the CTF and

363
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,100
normally it's happened happening in

364
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:53,330
March and it's one of the first attack

365
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:56,570
defense suggests that started to to make

366
00:17:53,330 --> 00:18:00,139
city s in this style and then there is

367
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:03,409
fast ETF that were quite newcomers and

368
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,550
it's usually in May June that's just an

369
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:08,180
example there are even more

370
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:11,059
attack-defence CTF but if you compare

371
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,280
with jeopardy style CTF the thing is

372
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:16,450
that they are not a lot of

373
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,540
attack-defence CTF like I would say like

374
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:21,860
10 or 20 per year and jeopardy is like

375
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,830
every week or every two weeks

376
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,990
some suggest in jeopardy style so if

377
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,809
also some example of a service so we

378
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:31,220
played the in Avars attack-defence CTF

379
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:34,580
there was the service called cheater

380
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:36,950
it was backed saw work written

381
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,980
completely in bash a completely webs are

382
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:43,190
written in bash and well the thing is it

383
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:46,160
has custom it has custom HTTP return

384
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:49,040
codes it's really screwed us up so we we

385
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,230
said ok we found some something how to

386
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,420
get flags to just register account there

387
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,370
and you can like get all the users and

388
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:58,520
then you can get from a user the flag if

389
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:02,449
you visit the profile and ok let's

390
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:05,240
ok let's just make a simple title to a

391
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:07,760
piping tool ok import request the

392
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,470
request library makeover al request to

393
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,740
this web page reduce for a count and

394
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:15,410
then we wrote it down and start to well

395
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,230
we just get the error message because

396
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:20,300
the customer should be returned code

397
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:23,570
import the request library just breaks

398
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:25,879
it just gives us an error and doesn't

399
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:28,370
work with the custom HTTP return cards

400
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,670
and so is it ok what to do next because

401
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:34,879
we like screwed up and then we like used

402
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:37,100
curl we called coral via patent on a

403
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,750
system command line and did it with

404
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,540
coral in the end when it was really a

405
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,790
really bad heck because they did screwed

406
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,500
up the request library of the custom HD

407
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:50,658
return codes

408
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:53,090
so what is the the service first Twitter

409
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:56,659
and it's like a Twitter clone said like

410
00:19:53,090 --> 00:20:00,080
 and you had in the end like a

411
00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:02,630
log of Teeter messages like

412
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,610
messages you can check out the whole

413
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:09,169
source code of the challenge on github

414
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:11,320
before with a writer and f they built up

415
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:14,270
multiple abilities so normally in

416
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,010
attack-defense in a service normally

417
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,440
they put up more will abilities to

418
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:21,440
exploit like just liked one or two or

419
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,970
three ways to get the flag normally even

420
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,710
sometimes you have to post a bit so to

421
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,070
get the flag over a different service

422
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:30,530
like cross cross exploitation is also

423
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:33,080
something that's possible and in this

424
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:35,178
service you notification bypass was

425
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,030
possible there was a info leak and there

426
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:41,299
was the admin bypass and the example for

427
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:42,620
the admin bypass was this one in the end

428
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:44,809
I realized it's really late

429
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,879
even it was nearly at the end of the CTF

430
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:50,570
because we had a lot of registered

431
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,390
accounts and there was this called a

432
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:55,939
middleware middleware stood a sage and I

433
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:58,820
I checked the log and every time people

434
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,610
residual accounts if la-la-la admin one

435
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,320
two three four and it wasn't really

436
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,689
suspicious for me but in the end there

437
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,299
is all fact they make registering admin

438
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:12,289
accounts because there is this check if

439
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:15,049
user is equal still the admin and this

440
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:18,110
means if if that's like lalala admin

441
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:23,450
1-2-3 it's also equal as admin user and

442
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:25,280
there is also and debug flag except then

443
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,039
the user admin and the thing is in the

444
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,370
first you check not all the config of

445
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:33,799
some web service and there was this was

446
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:36,439
a config file and the worst the debug

447
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:39,379
equals one and the first we will do is

448
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,600
like okay just set it to zero but the

449
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:46,250
thing is that this services if you set

450
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:48,889
it to zero the minus M still ever less

451
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:51,260
so true because it checks if there's any

452
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:53,720
value in this in this variable so even

453
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,520
if you set the debug to zero it will

454
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,669
still evaluate to true the muse and

455
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,029
debug

456
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:02,889
so reduce the combination if you set

457
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:05,440
like deep back to 0 and hit like a

458
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:07,658
registered account with lalala admit one

459
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,219
two three you've still got the admin

460
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:14,859
flag set so you had to read devil a

461
00:22:12,219 --> 00:22:17,019
relation of if Colossus in bash to

462
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:18,820
realize that you need to delete the

463
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:21,909
whole debug string in the config that it

464
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:25,989
don't relate it through that was one of

465
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:28,779
the of the box we found and then I at

466
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:33,429
least patched the user is admin tilde

467
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:40,659
that was then not working anymore so the

468
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:43,139
bakken beginner CTF yeah our beginner

469
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:45,700
CTF is the Joker D style CTF because

470
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:47,769
it's basically easier to host and we're

471
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,239
doing this for the first time so if this

472
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:51,309
works maybe we're doing an attack

473
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:53,379
defense next year

474
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:55,749
this also means you'll have the

475
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:57,279
different categories and you'll get

476
00:22:55,749 --> 00:23:02,079
specific challenges for the different

477
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:04,959
categories we mainly focused on writing

478
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:09,070
simple challenges for pickiness as in

479
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:10,959
you have some kind of some kind of

480
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:13,059
programming background background or

481
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:18,309
computer science background but you've

482
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:22,479
never done any exploitation stuff or web

483
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:25,029
stuff or reversing stuff and we wanted

484
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:27,489
for once to provide simple challenges

485
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:29,799
really simple challenges and we wanted

486
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:32,229
to hide the scoreboard because usually

487
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:34,839
if we just put about simple challenges

488
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:36,309
they will be solved in no time and then

489
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:39,039
the more experienced people will

490
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:42,789
instantly take over the scoreboard so we

491
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:45,039
decided to hide the scoreboard but we're

492
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:47,679
not hiding it for the whole CTF because

493
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,049
of some annoying Slovenian people here

494
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,719
now that our initial idea was really to

495
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:55,179
have no scoreboard at all but in the end

496
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:58,450
I know people want to compete here and

497
00:23:55,179 --> 00:24:00,099
we say ok we will take it no score and

498
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:04,509
tomorrow evening and then tomorrow night

499
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:06,450
will enable it for the last hours but in

500
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,519
the end it was like really Internet

501
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,220
Concord at all but still well let's

502
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,749
compete in the evening tomorrow so for

503
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,019
everyone wanting to compete and showing

504
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:19,590
off their skills where we'll have some

505
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:21,450
really hot challenges we'll try to give

506
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:24,928
them an appropriate score account to

507
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:26,909
make sure it will be possible to

508
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:28,499
differentiate them from the simple

509
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:31,129
challenges

510
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:33,989
yetsko bots will be available tomorrow

511
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:37,678
evening and then you have still have the

512
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:39,389
whole Sunday and challenges you solved

513
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,889
now will also show up in the scoreboard

514
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:46,340
later so just in case yeah for everyone

515
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:49,439
wanting to get completed competitive and

516
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:52,709
we at least I won't release all

517
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,929
challenges at the beginning I will add

518
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,779
more challenges especially for reversing

519
00:24:54,929 --> 00:25:00,869
and pawn and we have people contributing

520
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:04,440
challenges like Greeley's who's writing

521
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:09,749
challenges right now at this moment just

522
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:14,009
in time so there will be more challenges

523
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:17,070
at it over time and yeah the CTF will

524
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:20,580
start soon in about 15 minutes if

525
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:25,739
everything works and it will end on

526
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:27,689
Sunday at 6 p.m. the important part is

527
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:29,549
tomorrow there will be workshops for

528
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:33,809
people who have never played CTF before

529
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:36,389
and - or want to get into it we will be

530
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:39,570
available there at our CTF area in the

531
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:41,850
heck area most of the time and you can

532
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:44,700
also ask us stuff you're interested

533
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:47,009
about outside of the workshop hours so

534
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,080
if you have questions come to us ask us

535
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:52,259
if you like meetings maybe we can give

536
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:55,769
you some person beers whatever up really

537
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:57,899
if you have some struggles don't come to

538
00:25:55,769 --> 00:26:01,019
us and ask and speak with us we have no

539
00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:03,149
problems to help you out unless you're

540
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:06,249
trying to compete

541
00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:08,439
so the Slovenian guys you love if you're

542
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:13,419
not here if you come to us and ask how

543
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:15,720
to solve the heart challenges well yeah

544
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:17,590
I'll be holding a workshop for binary

545
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,950
exploitation and reverse engineering

546
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:24,279
tomorrow starting at 12:30 in the CTF

547
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:27,629
area it will take about two hours and

548
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:30,909
will roughly cover the basics because

549
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:33,219
there's you can't cover everything in

550
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:34,899
two hours but I'm there the whole day so

551
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:38,129
if you're interested in something more

552
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:41,408
you can still come around and ask me I

553
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:45,248
will have the workshop for web

554
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:49,720
challenges will also be a rough one hour

555
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:51,609
thirty two hours and show you like intro

556
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,330
what you have to start for web challenge

557
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:57,699
what to check out what tools you can use

558
00:26:54,330 --> 00:27:01,149
like some simple Python intro with

559
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:03,609
request for example and it will be

560
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:06,609
tomorrow at thirteen fourteen thirty I

561
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:09,879
was in the CTF area after the reversing

562
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:10,678
workshop so what to bring bring your

563
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:13,869
laptop

564
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,730
preferably running Linux or BSD we also

565
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:17,499
accept people's windows it's not a big

566
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:22,149
deal but it will maybe have probably

567
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:24,309
some at some challenges if you attend at

568
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:26,080
least if you attend my workshop because

569
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:30,639
there are some tools and the binaries

570
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,049
are usually running on Linux and you

571
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:33,668
don't you only have a Windows machine

572
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:37,119
you can ask me and I will create your

573
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:40,029
account on a virtual machine we can test

574
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:42,129
the tools and sausages so we'll have a

575
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:44,019
server where you can connect and have a

576
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:48,969
Linux environment and work there if you

577
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:51,700
like that's not a problem so basic

578
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:54,129
knowledge about programming is probably

579
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,749
needed for some exploits especially in

580
00:27:54,129 --> 00:28:02,259
the binary exploitation of brass

581
00:27:55,749 --> 00:28:05,940
engineering area and bring motivation we

582
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:10,179
wanted people learn some stuff that they

583
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:12,369
try stuff out and if of course if the

584
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:15,530
affection comes and ask us but the

585
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:17,449
biggest thing is we are doing it because

586
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:19,520
fun with it and we like to motivate

587
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:23,810
people to also enjoy the capture the

588
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:26,120
flag stuff and it's it's it's an

589
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:28,850
interesting thing because you learn a

590
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:32,120
lot of stuff sometime the learning curve

591
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:34,250
is quite quite high but but after you

592
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,679
you manage to like Seoul for challenge a

593
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:38,450
hard one you're like really into it and

594
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:42,470
say oh nice I really managed to do it

595
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:46,520
and so we recommend you check it at

596
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:50,210
least out and have fun we have like our

597
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:52,340
webpage so before the CTF we say ok what

598
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:54,680
we have like we want to do mine for it

599
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,600
and we just found it was founded instead

600
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,960
was for feel free so it just bought

601
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:04,129
domain and set up on Connecticut polar

602
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:09,140
Institute the CTF page with the C TFT

603
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:11,510
interface and yeah see you at the CTF

604
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,640
area or on at the venue

605
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:18,860
if you won't need something just speak

606
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:21,380
with us and have fun yeah are there some

607
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,540

remember the website you can always ask

609
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:29,540
us there's QR codes on the info Bheema

610
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:30,860
there should be purchased with QR codes

611
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:34,159
hanging around there is propaganda

612
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:36,169
around the venue and you can look it up

613
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:39,080
at the bottom website where which has a

614
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:42,500
CDF yeah there is a CT f sub page on the

615
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:44,870
bottom of page other still questions

616
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,130
here we are here and can answer probably

617
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,129
your questions

618
00:29:53,160 --> 00:30:00,680
what could possibly go wrong that's why

619
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:04,530
it's written that's why it's virtually

620
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:06,660
well made so we will see but maybe I

621
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:10,820
will give you access to my real laptop

622
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:14,720
that I have with me like one we will see

623
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:17,460
what could possibly go wrong but and

624
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:22,710
maybe if you need to get root access to

625
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:24,360
this laptop no questions at all all

626
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,490
right then

627
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,850
