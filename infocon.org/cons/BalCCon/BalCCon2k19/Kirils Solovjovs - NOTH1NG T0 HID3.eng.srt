hello next up nothing to hide from

4
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:46,480
some citizens complain about being under

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,550
surveillance but they are told that if

6
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,779
they have nothing to hide they have

7
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:54,610
nothing to fear still news media

8
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,260
regularly covers cases where citizens

9
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,840
with unusual behavior are put on

10
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:03,099
suspicious lists even though they have

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:07,570
broken no laws this is actually a quote

12
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:11,070
from a book not a news article yet a

13
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:15,850
small book Edra grams edition number 300

14
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:18,220
written by Jesper lund but I invite you

15
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:22,059
to take a look at this short collection

16
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,369
of short articles and see what the

17
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:29,740
future holds

18
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:32,259
privacy wise now the main confusion with

19
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,300
nothing to hide the argument is this

20
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:36,700
right here

21
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:39,940
if anyone the view still remembers this

22
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:43,380
this notation right here if not what it

23
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:46,929
means that for everyone who is a

24
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:52,360
criminal that everyone has something to

25
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:55,600
hide then the middle line here says from

26
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,850
that follows that for everyone who has

27
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:03,339
something to hide that everyone is a

28
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:06,579
criminal and that of course is wrong but

29
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:09,549
if we don't put these words in a

30
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:13,269
mathematical representation then for

31
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:15,070
some people that makes sense on daily

32
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:16,930
basis we think yeah yeah that that's a

33
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,720
good argument all right only criminals

34
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,010
give things to hide so if you have

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,790
something to card you must be criminal

36
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:26,290
all that is not the case and I'm also

37
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,359
bringing something new to the table at

38
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:32,170
least at least I think it's new

39
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,910
I believe I caught punch I'm right but I

40
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,869
believe I created the concept that that

41
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:39,510
I call our Schrodinger video camera

42
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,709
so what's rolling girl's video camera

43
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:46,600
imagine you have a nice apartment like

44
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:48,730
this one here in Paris and you live

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,989
there one day you notice that outside

46
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,989
the apartment on the wall

47
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:56,020
someone has installed

48
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:58,000
PTZ camera dome it's it's not

49
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,500
transparent it's an a PAC dome so it's

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,900
it's a black one you don't see word

51
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:06,670
cameras pointing you're not even sure if

52
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,520
there is a camera but the feeling you

53
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,440
get is it a good feeling like the does

54
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:16,810
it matter to you if you're being

55
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:19,290
surveilled or not or is privacy maybe

56
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,980
just a little bit about the feeling of

57
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,170
thank privates

58
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,899
maybe such the cameras there maybe it's

59
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,839
being rotated to you maybe they zooming

60
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,420
in on you maybe there's nothing in there

61
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,080
maybe just a security door like a fake

62
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:39,700
camera a prop you don't know but still I

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:42,190
think for most of us the feeling is not

64
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,720
a positive one so it's not about

65
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:49,230
actually being surveilled it's about

66
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,230
feeling private and what is privacy

67
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:57,160
privacy has multiple facets I'd say

68
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,780
first of all it's an autonomous right to

69
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:04,480
choose who processes my information like

70
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,400
maybe I like to let's go in t let's talk

71
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,859
about IT right maybe I'd like to work

72
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,640
with Google but I but I hate working

73
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,350
with like that go

74
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't want doctor God to have my

75
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,930
search queries so I just go to Google

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,320
it's my right to choose how is my info

77
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:24,280
processed right if I give someone money

78
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,820
information my home address to send me a

79
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,200
postcard that doesn't mean I consent to

80
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,740
that home address being published on the

81
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,920
Internet

82
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,540
that's the cow of data privacy and what

83
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,860
information is processed right if

84
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,570
someone has my common dress it doesn't

85
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,800
mean I'm ok with them having my phone

86
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,290
number or vice versa

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,090
and a different facet of that is right

88
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,620
to decide who I interact with right the

89
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,830
the classical right to privacy before

90
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,510
we've had so much information around we

91
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,310
can call it the the right to be left

92
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,840
alone if I don't want to talk to anyone

93
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,810
I I don't talk to anyone

94
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,260
that is reason why I don't have a phone

95
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,810
number

96
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,969
I do have phone not-not-not like some

97
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,650
other guys here kudos to those is there

98
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,960
at least two guys two speakers the

99
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,429
conference that that don't that don't

100
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,500
use the phone I do but I don't have a

101
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,000
phone number because I don't I want to

102
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,620
be left alone when I want interact with

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,230
someone I'll go and ask if they won't

104
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,900
talk to me I'll talk to them I don't

105
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,450
have a doorbell for reals I won't be

106
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,390
left alone and I don't give people my

107
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:26,469
address as well so those are the

108
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:29,020
fundamental aspects of privacy to me now

109
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,510
I've given a presentation on the topic

110
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,659
of privacy in the past year I've given

111
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:38,050
one here in bulk on a year ago I've also

112
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:40,990
given one at 35 c3 chaos list and I've

113
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,520
gotten some reactions from people in all

114
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,650
the presentations I've given on the

115
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,979
privacy topic so let's take a look at

116
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,359
some of them this is there's both the

117
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,640
reaction of course five thumbs up I'm

118
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,770
feeling like use reCAPTCHA take a look

119
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,659
at my previous presentation I I tried

120
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,539
not to include any slides from that

121
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,270
today because York has passed but but

122
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:01,840
it's also I hope entertaining and and

123
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,210
eye-opening

124
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,849
so yeah

125
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:09,280
then we have stuff like that interesting

126
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,470
and also not worth it at all your time

127
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,729
on this planet is limited you know then

128
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,320
gotten some comments after presentation

129
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,470
like it's pointless anyway you have a

130
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,620
phone you're on Twitter blah blah blah

131
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:22,720
and and of course this this was the best

132
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,730
here what are you presenting your

133
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,440
presentation without a face mask if you

134
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:31,030
care about privacy so much well if you

135
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,390
listen carefully you know the answer to

136
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:37,630
these questions privacy is about consent

137
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:39,460
and and I'm ok with you taking photos of

138
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,260
me or my slides or filming me and

139
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,180
putting me online while I'm standing

140
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,640
here when I'm gonna go and sit over

141
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,310
there I don't want to be filmed or than

142
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:51,909
one like photos to be taken so it's all

143
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,410
about consent but let's let's take a

144
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,870
look at this rather good argument your

145
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:58,120
time on this planet is limited I do

146
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,040
think about it a lot and and yeah I have

147
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,630
to make some hard choices right we we

148
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,560
aren't here forever like maybe 15 years

149
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:07,750
hundred years if you're lucky so it does

150
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,180
cost a lot of time and money um so you

151
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,860
have to find some balance but then again

152
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:16,060
if you got nothing to hide they have

153
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:20,590
some more arguments for you right one is

154
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,910
data hoarding and so someone that just

155
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,190
collects a piece of information about

156
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,830
you that may be not a threat not not

157
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,469
much of a threat but if someone say

158
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,880
government is in that position usually

159
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,470
collect a lot of information about you

160
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,180
then they hoard the data about you and

161
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,100
can lead to various consequences like

162
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,930
for example they can impersonate you

163
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,840
which is not what the government usually

164
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,270
does right but blackmail we don't know

165
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,479
no one no one is admitting off like that

166
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:49,310
but but oh that did I think US

167
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:54,590
government admitted blackmailing

168
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:58,250
who is that Martin Luther King yeah so

169
00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:01,549
yeah that stuff happens so data hoarding

170
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,560
leads to problems like and not only

171
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,330
government raw large corporations can

172
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,640
core data you and they can they can

173
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:11,240
impersonate you or hackers can hack that

174
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:14,630
data stash and then impersonate you now

175
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,760
back to government most of us are happy

176
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,860
enough lucky enough to live in countries

177
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,289
with relatively good governments that

178
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,120
don't go killing people or or putting

179
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:25,340
them in jail for no good reason most of

180
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,200
them most of the people sound some some

181
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:31,429
get to end up in jail for no good reason

182
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:33,200
unfortunately but today's government

183
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,720
that we have today might not be there

184
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,450
for long government doesn't usually live

185
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,490
for a hundred or even 50 years it looks

186
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,130
for like four or five years and you

187
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,080
don't know what you will get and it

188
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,080
might be replaced by the tow terrian

189
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,300
were simply inhumane regime and now that

190
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,810
it has all the data on you what we'll do

191
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:56,990
is the data now that it knows stuff that

192
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,670
is okay luckily to know today like

193
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:02,930
someone's sexual orientation over

194
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:05,569
political affiliation might and might

195
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:09,920
end you up on on on watchlist or a kill

196
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:11,330
list and then herd immunity finally this

197
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,910
is the most important for me this is

198
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:16,190
actually the real reason why I why am I

199
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,890
not wearing a face mask giving this

200
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:21,560
presentation I don't really care about

201
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,910
on privacy so much I I care about people

202
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,400
who really need privacy

203
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:29,810
people who are not in the position to do

204
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:33,290
as I do who cannot fight their

205
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:35,329
governments on or or who cannot come to

206
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,640
a hotel in Serbia and tell them I'm not

207
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,140
I'm not allowing you to copy my ID here

208
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,890
you can see it but you're not copying it

209
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,660
right because I know I have like up

210
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,340
friends here here here at the conference

211
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,430
who would really like me to speak or or

212
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:51,950
if if they kick me out of the hotel they

213
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:54,109
would provide something else for me so

214
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,500
many people are not in position like

215
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,030
that

216
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:00,650
so I want to support the people who

217
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:03,230
really need that because many people not

218
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:05,150
hiding anything will make the few

219
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,160
that do have something to hide stand out

220
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,050
more and that matter draw suspicion just

221
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,760
because they are hiding something and

222
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:16,760
that is that is important now for the

223
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,090
next part I want to talk about privacy

224
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:24,319
nightmares so some of the things that I

225
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:25,640
observe around me or online that that's

226
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,430
not so good for privacy

227
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,770
well my presentation a year ago had had

228
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:35,959
this slide the presentation started with

229
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:38,329
my words privacy is dead and a year ago

230
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,610
I presented how how in May last year

231
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,680
people daily try and tweeted that hey we

232
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,780
found a new use for surveillance cameras

233
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,959
let's point them at our children that

234
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:51,589
are learning in schools and then we can

235
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:53,510
you know have this nice menu for the for

236
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:56,150
the teacher then you see how many pupils

237
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,890
are concentrating how many pupils are

238
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,959
not paying attention coming you're

239
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,030
afraid right please don't call me out I

240
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,280
haven't done my homework and I see that

241
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:07,930
immediately so that's a cool tag they

242
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:10,100
had last year now in January 2019

243
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:12,109
there's a new thing from China so

244
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,790
Chinese school scanning children's

245
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,880
brains the scenes they're concentrating

246
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,709
apparently the last system didn't have

247
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,939
enough data quality maybe maybe it had a

248
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,080
lot of false positives or false

249
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:26,600
negatives so this this should go well

250
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,460
but it's not only it's not only China

251
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,990
specifically all right we have we have

252
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:35,180
this this thing here where people are

253
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,550
students is still in small small

254
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,089
children are getting into the schools

255
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:43,099
through a face scanner and so basically

256
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,050
the marketing ploy and this one is it

257
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,120
makes schools more secure because you

258
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,609
can find missing children you can I'm

259
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:54,470
sure you can reuse or abused information

260
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:56,150
in a myriad of ways but as of if we talk

261
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,860
about keeping bumpers out at the school

262
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:01,790
I mean it's not hard to jump that that

263
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:05,000
barrier for an adult male or female so

264
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:09,230
yeah then we have Hong Kong of course

265
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,930
this happened in June 2019 people were

266
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:14,390
being aware of tracking their movement

267
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,069
and they were kinda afraid to use their

268
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,790
MetroCard so what what what they were

269
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,320
doing there

270
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,719
buying paper tickets even though they

271
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,340
usually use this digital system in

272
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,190
Latvia where I come from we also have a

273
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,650
digital system for for traveling in the

274
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:30,200
public transport and we actually had a

275
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:34,100
case it was parts of parts of the case

276
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:36,140
were public unfortunately a driver

277
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,680
driving public transport a Rundle red

278
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:42,170
light and and killed someone so the

279
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,420
police pulled the record of of all the

280
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,459
personalized cards used on the transport

281
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:50,030
and interrogated the rewedding I mean

282
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:53,120
I'm all for resolving crimes in in the

283
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:55,550
reasonable manner but I believe in a

284
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,350
society where everybody who who has

285
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:59,930
something contribute to an investigation

286
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,330
of that kind would go to the police

287
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,620
themselves and say yeah I saw something

288
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,240
and and if they didn't see something

289
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,690
they would not go to the police so I

290
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,550
kind of look look down upon police using

291
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,320
using this data like that but I mean it

292
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:16,280
can be in other ways for sure if they

293
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,050
have the access to the data here for for

294
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,699
protests in Hong Kong people were afraid

295
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,290
that they will end up on some watch list

296
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:25,040
because of going to the protest so they

297
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:26,930
were smart enough to use paper tickets

298
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,730
luckily we still have the option to buy

299
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:31,370
paper tickets if you look at my last

300
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,470
year's presentation in Latvia for say

301
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,370
high school student or university

302
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,900
student the difference between using

303
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:41,150
subsidized tickets or buying a paper

304
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:46,810
ticket is a six hundred and sixty six

305
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:46,810
percent increase no joke in in the price

306
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:55,610
let's talk about Facebook everyone loves

307
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:58,220
Facebook anyone here is on Facebook yeah

308
00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:01,580
we have some people any one of you buy

309
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,350
their own free will I get I get live we

310
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,640
have some I guess my friends threatening

311
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,230
me all the time we're gonna make you a

312
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,630
Facebook account if you don't if you

313
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,490
don't join yeah sometimes they do but

314
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,290
then then I talk to them nicely and and

315
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,970
they you know they remove the Facebook

316
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:19,880
account to get to get get back access to

317
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:23,210
their computer so this is this is a

318
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,920
quote this is an article actually that

319
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,770
has some quotes surrounding a court case

320
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,599
where Facebook was was either put on

321
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,810
trial or being put on trial I'm not I'm

322
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,740
not

323
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:35,479
experts on American legal system so what

324
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,610
they said what representative said is

325
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,800
there is no privacy interest in using

326
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,750
Facebook because by sharing with a

327
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,240
hundred friends on social media platform

328
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,980
which is an affirmative social act to

329
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,779
publish to disclose to share ostensibly

330
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,330
private information with hundred people

331
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:52,279
you have just under centuries of common

332
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:54,650
law under the judgment of Congress under

333
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:59,300
the ACA negated any reasonable

334
00:14:54,650 --> 00:15:04,130
expectation of privacy so once again

335
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:05,719
this here is about data reuse their

336
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,450
argument is you publish it to your

337
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,550
friends so it's public domain like we

338
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:13,279
can copy it we can we can do it everyone

339
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,660
does it if someone has if some of the

340
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,220
Facebook users here have actually read

341
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,589
the agreement they have his Facebook

342
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,210
maybe legally that's the case I'm not

343
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:21,680
sure I haven't read it but just because

344
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,600
I'm not a facebook user because I

345
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,150
actually have read all my license

346
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,050
agreements with Twitter and and other

347
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:31,970
software they use some ten years ago I

348
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:36,290
was working for an international company

349
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:39,380
that had an office where I live and on

350
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:41,209
my first day when when they had this

351
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,630
onboarding meeting they told me this is

352
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:46,339
a software he gonna use I looked at the

353
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,710
software tried to launch it it it

354
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:50,300
presented me with an agreement and I I

355
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:52,339
went back to my superiors that case

356
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,800
there's there's agreement for for almost

357
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:56,900
all the stuff for what do I do it's an

358
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,530
American company so they said well I

359
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:04,040
mean you have to read it so they were

360
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:06,230
paying me for almost four full days to

361
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,480
read fleiss's agreements for where the

362
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,280
software is gonna use so that's kind of

363
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,589
cool the since then I read the license

364
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,540
agreements so but here in this Facebook

365
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:16,550
case they are in my opinion

366
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,280
misunderstanding a basic fact about

367
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:21,260
privacy it's still about consent it's by

368
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,000
Mark consent if I have consented to

369
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,370
share this piece of information who is

370
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,529
one of my friends or with a hundred of

371
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,230
my friends or with ten thousand of my

372
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:32,270
friends it doesn't mean that a different

373
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,160
person has the right to read it

374
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:37,010
yes the reality is such as it is hard to

375
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,709
control and the argument has some merit

376
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:42,560
because the article also has has some

377
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:43,510
quote like from that relates to to the

378
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,790
middle-ages I think

379
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,040
or after that when you go to a public

380
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,329
square and just shout stuff outright no

381
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,120
reasonable special private you there

382
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:54,100
well I mean with today's technology it

383
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,800
has drawn looking at who is hearing what

384
00:16:54,100 --> 00:17:00,250
you felt in maybe it could help them

385
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:04,510
hold them accountable and not propagate

386
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:06,839
the information any further one more

387
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:10,089
thing about Facebook suicide prevention

388
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:12,429
if you read an article about the little

389
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:13,659
prevention on Facebook anyone thinks

390
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:17,199
it's a it's a good thing a cool thing

391
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:19,089
something we do need that yeah yeah some

392
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,970
people do that's it the bad is that it

393
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:24,550
is a bad thing yeah some people do as

394
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,660
well so yeah I also personally have

395
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,579
mixed feelings about that

396
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,580
I mean suicide prevention is an

397
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:33,669
important task that that needs to be

398
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,889
carried out at some point but the the

399
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:38,260
way Facebook carries it out is is quite

400
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,540
creepy maybe even unnecessary creepy in

401
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:44,140
my opinion so this is from their

402
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:46,120
official official description of of the

403
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,790
of the tool of the algorithm they also

404
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,510
have this nice picture in there about

405
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:54,790
how it works so we have some signals

406
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:57,250
right for example what you type when you

407
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,930
type it what day you type it on with a

408
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,510
also analyze the comments that people

409
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,520
add then they have some magical

410
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,700
algorithms AI basically machine learning

411
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:10,270
that decides if the post should be

412
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:12,850
reviewed by a human or not and then it's

413
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:15,430
reviewed by a human and then the human

414
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:18,100
can take action and there are a couple

415
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:20,290
actions they can take they can send tips

416
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:24,370
or resources or they can escalate to

417
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:27,490
local authorities and now I would prefer

418
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,560
to see an algorithm like that even

419
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,970
though algorithms are creepy even more

420
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,530
creepier than humans in my opinion

421
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,810
because you know it's it's not a human

422
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,730
you know what it thinks so

423
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:38,800
I would prefer human not to be involved

424
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,020
in this because one of the two actions

425
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,030
sent tips and resources is this so

426
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,860
basically this stuff appears on your

427
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:48,430
Facebook screen that that's it that's

428
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:51,070
the action so false positive wouldn't be

429
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:53,380
too damaging to the user and I mean

430
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,689
Facebook is investing a lot to draw

431
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,920
people to continue to continuously use

432
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,450
it so I mean

433
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,890
users wouldn't stop using it just

434
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,710
because they get some false positives

435
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:05,140
like that I think so involving a human

436
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:08,500
is is maybe not that necessary at at

437
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,720
that point now continuing on the topic

438
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,870
of Facebook there's new cool thing

439
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,910
called Facebook dating it appeared in

440
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:19,090
the in the u.s. it was rolled out just

441
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:20,610
now and this coming to you at the

442
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:23,949
beginning of next year yeah I can't wait

443
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:25,929
so actually from the article because I

444
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,540
haven't haven't taken a look at it yet

445
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:31,030
from the article it seems that Facebook

446
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:34,090
is rolling out some additional privacy

447
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:35,740
features alongside Facebook dating which

448
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,080
is something that people in u.s. don't

449
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,270
get people in EU get the gdpr thing and

450
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,800
the Facebook is really tough on on

451
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,050
things right which is which is making

452
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,419
life harder for stalkers and other bad

453
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,790
people um in the u.s. they don't have

454
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,050
such a tight application to do that but

455
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:52,270
with Facebook dating they're bringing

456
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:55,240
some of the EU features - to the US

457
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,950
which is good but one thing that

458
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,010
Facebook dating is bringing to the US

459
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:02,620
and most likely to you as well is

460
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,780
location confirmation so in order to be

461
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,780
able to every use the feature you have

462
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:11,710
to have a GPS enabled device and it has

463
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:13,330
to have been on at some point if you

464
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,400
want to change your location for some

465
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:17,889
reason well likely you have moved so we

466
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,370
have traveled the GPS has to have been

467
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:23,380
on at the new location again so we are

468
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,850
actually gonna be providing the security

469
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,860
conscious of us are going to be

470
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:32,080
providing more data to Facebook if we

471
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:35,560
decide to use the feature then for CCTV

472
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,929
I had this slide in my presentation last

473
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,600
year this is from UK all of those three

474
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:43,810
are real posters from the streets of the

475
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,879
UK government watching you but what I

476
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:48,190
have to add well now they doing this

477
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,290
stuff facial recognition and man was

478
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,090
fined 90 pounds for refusing to show his

479
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,870
face the police trialing new facial

480
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,659
recognition software

481
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:58,030
I read the article carefully I read

482
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:01,870
alternate sources that's it that was the

483
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:04,120
crime not showing face - the software

484
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:07,209
and he was forced to show the face to

485
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,100
the software and find he he wasn't find

486
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,480
anything else he wasn't under warrant

487
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,449
warrant or

488
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,309
nothing nothing he just was walking by

489
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:17,320
pulled his jumper above his chin and

490
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:19,600
that's it and they a you suspicious you

491
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,409
scan your face at them so that's where

492
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,990
we're living in then we have that saying

493
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:28,890
the end of the under fan to end

494
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:37,210
encryption it's coming

495
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:39,700
unfortunately GCHQ suggested that we

496
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:42,280
need to end this thing they even called

497
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:45,910
it warrant proof encryption which again

498
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,799
it's it is in a way weren't proof but is

499
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,910
it better or not that is that is

500
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:51,250
debatable thing

501
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:53,740
GCHQ isn't the only one trying to do

502
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:56,140
that basically five eyes is is on two on

503
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,780
twenty encryption and they wanna then

504
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,940
one end it and the first country the

505
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,220
first large country was with enough

506
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:06,190
impact that that's actually doing that

507
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:08,950
already is of course Australia they've

508
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:11,590
had the the law which is not like 100

509
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,299
percent hard law saying no but it's 99

510
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,178
percent like no end-to-end encryption

511
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:19,230
like or you have to give access somehow

512
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:24,669
it's been it's been in an in power for

513
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:26,169
half a year maybe a year so yeah we've

514
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:27,820
done struggle we sent an encryption now

515
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:30,790
because I certainly has that Firewise

516
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:33,070
want that in a year I bet one of the

517
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:35,080
large whatsapp so sorry

518
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:38,139
messaging applications are gonna

519
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:44,100
implement something about that so

520
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:48,309
speaking of whatsapp this thing happened

521
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,990
so an article appeared saying that in in

522
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:51,970
the whatsapp help saying that routed

523
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,490
phones are not supported by what's up

524
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:58,299
anymore so you you can't is rooted phone

525
00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:01,000
wonder why well they say because that

526
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:02,770
way we can't provide the security that

527
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,890
we're supposed to provide you or in

528
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:07,690
there were and they were in their word

529
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:10,980
what's up security model cannot function

530
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:14,020
as intended wonder what their model is

531
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,669
we also have the same of course for iOS

532
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,190
same stuff don't jailbreaking phone

533
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:19,570
sorry not gonna work so if you can't use

534
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,220
rooted android phones and if you can't

535
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,049
use jailbroken iOS devices what do you

536
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,800
do because web doesn't work without

537
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:26,770
mobile do

538
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:29,260
for what's up well obviously you use a

539
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:31,960
third-party app for what's up oh wait

540
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,220
but you can't really use that and

541
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,900
they've been doing that for five years

542
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,030
but but they're doing that like every

543
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,800
two years and and beginning of this

544
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:41,260
year's I started this new cycle again

545
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,669
warning everyone do not use on official

546
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,879
apps you're gonna be blocked right and

547
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:47,140
it's it's been their in their

548
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,210
information materials for quite some

549
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,560
time right your account will get

550
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,880
temporarily banned that means you used

551
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,010
an unofficial app please don't do that

552
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,500
so use an official app so we're screwed

553
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:59,010
we can't block what's up from doing bad

554
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,330
stuff through routing our phone we can't

555
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:03,310
install third-party app for another loud

556
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,720
- luckily we have other services but

557
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:08,260
we'll see what happens

558
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,330
with them because personally I'm I'm not

559
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:14,230
so sure that government would hesitate

560
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,889
to block a whole service if they run out

561
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,640
of options

562
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:21,220
or maybe block VPNs for example like

563
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,900
some countries have been doing Russia

564
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:28,240
China and one of the Saudi countries

565
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,070
VPNs are banned Latvia where I'm from

566
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,580
has started the debate on blocking VP

567
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:36,399
and even though four years ago I was

568
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,110
part of governmental discussions saying

569
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,970
this is slippery slope you're gonna end

570
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,340
banning VPNs if you do the censorship

571
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:47,440
stuff that the censorship stuff and now

572
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:49,090
they gonna wanna ban VPNs now it's a bit

573
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,040
depressing right I see lots of frowny

574
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:55,389
faces let's let's talk about good stuff

575
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:58,210
GDP our GDP our is good especially for

576
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:00,190
those living in the I think actually you

577
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,220
can kinda you can kind of pretend to be

578
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:04,540
in the you to to to use GDP are in in

579
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,190
some circumstance I haven't seen any

580
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,780
research done on that but if someone

581
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,030
wants to do a presentation next bulk on

582
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,500
maybe you can do some research like can

583
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:14,290
you can you use UDP air for good if

584
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:17,020
you're not a EU citizen anyway so some

585
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:19,149
of you what many of you not cough but

586
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,620
what many of you are EU citizens and

587
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,760
then tell you what you can get and those

588
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,129
of you who can become

589
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,500
EU citizens either by joining the the

590
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:31,270
great union that were or by by by simply

591
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,800
becoming citizen of an e state this is

592
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,050
what we get this is this how we can

593
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,450
protect and IV protect our data and I've

594
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:40,659
used many of those quite extensively

595
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:43,000
the thing is we've had GDP or like

596
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:45,820
legislation in Latvia for the past 18

597
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,050
years before GDP came along so nothing

598
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,419
really changed except it's fines we had

599
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:53,290
maximum fine of 500 euros now it's a

600
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:54,580
million or whatever so that changed so

601
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,990
you get the right to know who is

602
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,590
processing what and why and there's a

603
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:01,780
list of things that that you can get

604
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:04,480
from the date processor the next couple

605
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,340
of slides have have been legally taken

606
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,560
from the European Union they said you

607
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:11,649
can use them as long as you quote the

608
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:13,960
author so copyright European Union yeah

609
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:16,750
so you can get all a bunch of this stuff

610
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:20,080
and what I do is that I mostly base off

611
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:21,910
bad data processors so if they if they

612
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,010
abuse my data I just send the request

613
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,150
for everything when you get it who did

614
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,350
you get it how do you process it do you

615
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,750
have any automation stuff like that and

616
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,159
then and then they have to write the

617
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,450
answer to that we'll have questions in

618
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,870
the end please write it down so we

619
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:36,760
remember that then you can also have the

620
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,280
right to object you can say nope I don't

621
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,800
want you to process my data anymore

622
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,680
yeah in case you've given it to them you

623
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,450
also have the right to have the data

624
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,130
deleted it's a bit different from the

625
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,600
other one right one is if they

626
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,250
processing it based on the law the other

627
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,020
one is if they processing it based on

628
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:55,090
the contract or if you have a contract

629
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,430
like you can even have it they delete it

630
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:59,199
for example if you submit a photo to a

631
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,880
non-governmental entity for some reason

632
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,830
before a contract you can have it

633
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,660
deleted nice huh

634
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:07,419
and you can also access your own data

635
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:10,720
right you can ask give me everything you

636
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:12,850
know about me and those things lead to

637
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,410
of course the right to move your data if

638
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:16,919
you can get your data and you can delete

639
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:20,860
your data you can move it to a different

640
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:22,060
provider and this right specifically

641
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:25,300
tells it has to be in a reasonable

642
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:28,270
format so they can't send you scanned

643
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,950
handwritten notes with your data if they

644
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,450
have it in database they have to give it

645
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,330
to you in a database like format so you

646
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:36,180
can port it easily the right to correct

647
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:38,889
your data of course is very important

648
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:41,560
credit registries are a huge thing in

649
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:43,150
the US and smaller thing in the EU if

650
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,370
they have wrong yet about you you can't

651
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:49,000
you can't do anything unless you like

652
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:50,379
cash a lot like I do and and then you

653
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,539
don't care about the banks think about

654
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,740
you

655
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:56,470
having the right to correct your data is

656
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:59,499
a good thing and and this is the best

657
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:02,860
one you have a right to have a say when

658
00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:06,009
decisions are automated so we have a

659
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:09,129
bunch of startups doing all this AI

660
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:10,570
machine learning crap and basically you

661
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:11,590
submit some data and they say okay

662
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,210
you're going to use the app you're not

663
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,559
going to use the app you can do that

664
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,059
you're not gonna do that you gotta have

665
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,908
credit you're gonna have smaller credit

666
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:20,918
and you have a right to say I want human

667
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:22,419
review on that unless it's government

668
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:24,970
mandated then then you don't have the

669
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:27,340
right to do that so I've exercised

670
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:30,700
that's right on the service it was

671
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:33,158
providing taxi it was a taxi app it was

672
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,779
providing transportation so I said hey I

673
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:38,289
don't I don't like you banning my

674
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:39,399
prepaid payment cards I need a human to

675
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:41,230
review the decision because it's not

676
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:43,508
fraud that's my prepaid payment court

677
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,980
yes I have ten of them because the limit

678
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:49,179
is a hundred euros and I buy them each

679
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:50,769
month and yeah they basically send me a

680
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:52,059
letter saying okay since you don't trust

681
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:53,830
us to do automatic review we are

682
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:59,320
deleting your user so we going to court

683
00:28:53,830 --> 00:29:01,360
on that one right now we touched we

684
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,950
already touched the story's part so last

685
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,959
year I gave a bunch of stories about how

686
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:07,299
my life is going doing doing privacy

687
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,429
enforcement for myself I have news

688
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:12,908
stories for you including we'll talk

689
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:15,940
more about taxi app as well but let's

690
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:17,529
start with certification I mean I don't

691
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,970
I don't personally I'm not a big fan of

692
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:21,009
certification but I have to have

693
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,690
certification because of reasons so I do

694
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,279
certification exams I do a lot of them

695
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,919
usually like two or three new

696
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:29,320
certificates per year and every time

697
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:32,529
they want to take and store a photo of

698
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,860
my face and I can't understand why so

699
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:38,499
every time I write them it's not a gdpr

700
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:41,379
but that's there's this eu-us agreement

701
00:29:38,499 --> 00:29:42,999
called privacy shield which is supposed

702
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:45,009
to protect citizens when data is

703
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:47,110
processed in the u.s. so write them a

704
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:49,149
privacy shield request every time after

705
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,158
successfully passing an exam saying hey

706
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:51,969
great exam delete my biometrics

707
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:54,009
including my face

708
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:56,110
and every time they delete it after

709
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:57,519
after some discussion and and then they

710
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,439
take the photo again like they don't get

711
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:00,850
tired of that every time I suggest maybe

712
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,919
next time don't force me to take a photo

713
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,780
ignore that so okay that's all right my

714
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,780
right is the requests deadly

715
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:10,178
so one time this is what happened I

716
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,490
requested the data deletion they deleted

717
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:15,970
the data and then my certificates were

718
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:17,740
gone so we can't we cut long

719
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,970
conversation it took about two months to

720
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,040
restore the certificates and you know

721
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,470
what they asked me could you send us the

722
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,260
list of certificates you enter storage

723
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:27,669
I of course tried not to of use that I

724
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,870
just have nope I'm not sending you I

725
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:30,970
could send you anything you find the

726
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,590
certificates so they restored almost all

727
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:36,010
the certificates except some that I've

728
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:37,209
taken during BET exams and I said hey

729
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:39,460
you haven't restored all of them look

730
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,540
look deeper they looked for a couple

731
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,679
more weeks and they restored all

732
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,690
certificates yeah they sincerely

733
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,830
apologized and and now I'm thinking if

734
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,350
there's a good lawyer who would talk

735
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:49,720
that pro bono because I mean it's it's

736
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:51,010
yeah I mean they apologized so it's all

737
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,640
good right

738
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:57,370
okay mobile apps so this thing here

739
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,380
right we can we have an app iOS model

740
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,909
currently also available on on the new

741
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:04,660
versions of Android when you when you

742
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:06,730
have power to decide on permission to

743
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,890
permission basis if you want the app to

744
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:12,150
have that access or not so here we have

745
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:13,929
an app asking you to access the contact

746
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:16,750
socratic would like to access your

747
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:18,700
contacts and iOS well Apple iOS

748
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,799
developers meaning Apple of course

749
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,350
provide a nice ability for the app

750
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:25,900
creators to enter some custom text to

751
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,549
explain what's going on so socratic has

752
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,740
done that they saying it's only for

753
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:30,100
chatting about homework don't worry okay

754
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,049
cool

755
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,418
so of course you you select the right

756
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:38,230
option I mean the left option you press

757
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:39,040
don't allow and of course socratic says

758
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,590
we kind of need that

759
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,210
sorry go to settings so that's what many

760
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,340
apps do and more and more apps will be

761
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:49,360
doing if not for gdpr so that's kind of

762
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:51,428
good then we have the de taxi app so our

763
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,770
our fight started kind of is this they

764
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:56,080
they change their brand and updated

765
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:58,480
their visual identity and you you

766
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,090
totally cannot see it in the picture but

767
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,910
under this white pop up in the left

768
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:05,709
corner there's a menu button where you

769
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:08,020
can access all your write history your

770
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:10,690
email address your data logout stuff

771
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:12,490
like that the button cannot be pressed

772
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,490
because the problem is over it since

773
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:17,720
they update so I submitted the

774
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:20,929
submitted the support request and they

775
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,190
asked me what is your email address our

776
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:24,769
first test why do you need my email

777
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,929
address it's a bug in your app they said

778
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:28,730
sorry we can't process we can't process

779
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:29,899
any support questions on email risk so I

780
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,580
said I wrote them

781
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:32,750
sorry I can't access my email address

782
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,269
your app doesn't work I don't know what

783
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,919
any motorist is so but the good thing is

784
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:39,139
I could still use that I could still

785
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:41,630
press the pick up manually button on the

786
00:32:39,139 --> 00:32:44,360
bottom there and I could I could call

787
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:47,210
the taxi so what I did is I I came back

788
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:49,639
from conference to my airport I I call

789
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,950
the taxi I wrote down the taxi drivers

790
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:53,689
name the the license plate the time I

791
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,159
called for the taxi time I got in the

792
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,679
taxi the time I get out of the taxi and

793
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:59,630
I send this to them hey you probably can

794
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,940
you know look in the database this is me

795
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:04,179
that's me that's a guy that's my driver

796
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:06,350
that's the license plate and so on and

797
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:09,110
they told me nope we don't have access

798
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,820
to that so I created a different support

799
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:12,649
account I wrote them an email hey by the

800
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,500
way do you by any chance store

801
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:17,149
information on which user drives which

802
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,309
which car is the passenger at what time

803
00:33:17,149 --> 00:33:20,870
they said yeah so then I went back to my

804
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:22,309
first user reference the other support

805
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:25,760
they kept saying hey you have the data

806
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:28,158
and then they disappeared so then we

807
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,899
went to the paper paper trail thing he's

808
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,880
starting writing to them and and that is

809
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:33,439
basically that's basically when they

810
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,750
wrote me wrote me an official letter

811
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,630
it's missing a signature though so we

812
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,799
still have to allegedly they wrote me an

813
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,740
official letter we still have to find

814
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:44,120
out if it's they or not saying that

815
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,830
since you have lost trust in our

816
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:49,158
application we are here by removing your

817
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:52,750
user from our application which of

818
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:54,889
course followed from my side by I

819
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,929
exercise my right which was not one of

820
00:33:54,889 --> 00:33:58,428
the not on not on the right slide this

821
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:00,889
is also right under gdpr

822
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:02,419
the right to temporarily block all

823
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:04,100
processing of data so if there's a

824
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:06,470
dispute about your date processing you

825
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,969
have a right to ask the company to not

826
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:09,829
do anything is they to put it away and

827
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:12,500
just wait for the court decision so

828
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:16,250
that's what I asked so yeah no I don't

829
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,659
have a taxi service too bad but we have

830
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,310
another taxi service in Latvia it's

831
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:21,679
called Yandex taxi

832
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:23,210
it didn't work from the beginning when I

833
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,830
when I when I installed it just to try

834
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:30,830
it out I I was flying I think to Ukraine

835
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:33,770
I use foreign SIM cards in outside EU so

836
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:36,199
I I wrote the taxi to the airport in

837
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:38,330
Latvia I saw the driver put me five or

838
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,399

845
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:56,540
news you can ride with Yandex taxi next

846
00:34:53,090 --> 00:35:00,440
time in 2022 December 31st you've been

847
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:03,560
bad I don't know I mean crazy stuff so

848
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,900
now only this year they actually publish

849
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,730
the privacy policy outlining what kind

850
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,960
of information they need and for some

851
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,940
information they say yeah we need

852
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,470
location to provide you better service

853
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,450
but you can't turn off location through

854
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:17,750
the settings and then so fine now but

855
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:20,779
there are categories of data that you

856
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:22,700
cannot not give them right for example

857
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,650
it's super important for them to have

858
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,810
user interaction like scrolling clicking

859
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:29,750
and dragging this menu otherwise app can

860
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:31,130
not work it's super important for them

861
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,750
to know who made your device what

862
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,970
operating system is and what version is

863
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,920
what your screen size the sensor

864
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:39,189
information like what sensors do you

865
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,080
have in your phone this camera sensor

866
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,970
may be device identifiers and so on

867
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,960
amount of disk placed list of installed

868
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:50,390
apps and it all goes to to an app that's

869
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,520
owned by a company in Russia so and you

870
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:54,770
can't turn it off

871
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,500
there we go um continuing with mobile

872
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:59,000
apps messaging Konami mostly last year I

873
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,640
told year I found a way to message

874
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,020
naanum asleep well actually I told it's

875
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,569
hard to message honestly I have no way

876
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:07,730
then then I spoke to some people and now

877
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:09,860
I have all the messaging apps each of

878
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:11,480
them has a separate phone number I

879
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,250
travel lock the cons so I just take a

880
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,140
conference conference mobile cards I

881
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,220
register an account and I have my

882
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,650
account so that's great

883
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,899
the problem is when it expires someone

884
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:23,420
can go and rewrite it so what they do

885
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:26,720
you use lock codes you lock down your

886
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:29,300
account but what happens then then every

887
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,089
like months or even more often the app

888
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,200
says hey do you still remember your PIN

889
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,970
now I don't remember my pain I've

890
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,259
written down somewhere just in case but

891
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,180
I don't want remember it it's a

892
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,650
throwaway account but you get these

893
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,730
reminders so it's a bit annoying that

894
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:43,190
way

895
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:47,450
how they actually buy apps anonymous

896
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:49,099
link well I haven't given I use this

897
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:52,308
this is an iPhone here I use an iPhone I

898
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:54,650
haven't given my credit card I don't

899
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:56,660
have a credit card I haven't given any

900
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,970
of my information to Apple so it's it's

901
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,440
a fake name don't tell them and and the

902
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:02,480
fake address and doesn't have a credit

903
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,430
card so sometimes there are some good

904
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,990
apps that you wanna or need to pay for

905
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,149
doesn't matter I I want to pay for good

906
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:10,220
apps how they bar them well gift cards

907
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:12,530
obviously you ask a friend to give you

908
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,058
to give you a gift card and the good

909
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,799
thing is you don't actually have to

910
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:17,420
answer a real email at all

911
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:20,540
you can enter local cos at local cost

912
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:22,190
and email gets sent to nowhere but the

913
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,720
people the person buying it gets a

914
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,040
prompt do you want to print out the gift

915
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,959
card and there's a code in there so if

916
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,020
you take the gift card code and you and

917
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,760
you use that yeah but I mean it it does

918
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,740
it does come at all my friends I mean

919
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,700
they get they get tired of me asking for

920
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:41,229
 all the time

921
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:45,980
so privacy privacy is hard can idea then

922
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:48,260
last last year I told you I've been I've

923
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,780
been interested in privacy for five to

924
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,349
ten years well apparently that's not

925
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,150
true

926
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:55,819
turns out I've been into privacy for at

927
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:59,690
least 15 years this is a voucher to

928
00:37:55,819 --> 00:38:03,109
access conference for free from

929
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:08,000
thousands before on top there's my name

930
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:10,430
and afterwards there is an address which

931
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,579
is on the rest of the hotel but I've

932
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:15,348
never rented a room in so apparently

933
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:16,880
somehow 15 years ago I thought it's not

934
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:21,109
a good idea to give these guys my home

935
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,339
address speaking of home address I still

936
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:25,250
don't give people my dress but I

937
00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:27,710
love to receive mails so I use post

938
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:30,559
office boxes I don't know how much it

939
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:32,450
cost in your countries in Latvia it's

940
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,640
around 15 euros per year

941
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:38,328
and you get a post office box it's

942
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,190
amazing but we are getting these New Age

943
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:42,440
people like I've actually had I've

944
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:45,890
actually had a situation with government

945
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:49,790
agency this month they apologized to me

946
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:52,490
saying so a young a young lady talked to

947
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,870
me in in in the agency and and told me

948
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,399
sorry I'm not from

949
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:59,120
Soviet times I didn't know what that

950
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,920
address means so I we were we were

951
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,440
communicating with current agencies

952
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,420
through postal mail as I do and I had my

953
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,100
P o box on it as the return address and

954
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,960
they didn't send me the reply through

955
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:11,720
there instead they googled me and said

956
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,910
to be an email so ya parently that's old

957
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:16,220
people's stuff using using P or boxes

958
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:20,690
but I mean it's nice secure and you can

959
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:23,120
send me send me stuff so yeah airport

960
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:25,880
scanners they're the new ones those are

961
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:30,069
very good right it's fast secure and

962
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:32,870
safe and no radiation toll or not so

963
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:37,220
yeah you can actually opt out of those

964
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:40,460
and I suggest you do and I think it's

965
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:44,899
almost like everywhere except UK I mean

966
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:46,940
the oh really also you don't get that

967
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:49,790
yeah so yeah it's under the Queen right

968
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:51,920
so obviously um maybe they did at the

969
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,990
same time right because UK had an

970
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,930
opt-out then they decided nope no

971
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:58,310
uploads and I mean you you have they

972
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:00,049
positioned like that you have an opt-out

973
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:01,790
you can go through scanner or you can

974
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:05,690
opt out and not flying that's your

975
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:07,580
choice then European Court went and told

976
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:09,200
nope UK you're doing it wrong you have

977
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:11,840
written right here that is not the way

978
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,029
you do it so now you can opt out but

979
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,650
well not for long if brexit happens then

980
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:19,820
they they have already announced plans

981
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:22,040
to put it back as well mandatory opt-out

982
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:24,530
thingy where you have to have to do it

983
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:27,350
yeah don't do it one thing one thing I

984
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:29,170
dislike about those alongside radiation

985
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:31,910
is of course the automated decision

986
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:34,610
which is interesting on under gdpr I

987
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:37,100
mean you could ask you could ask on GDP

988
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:39,710
are to say I don't want a taking

989
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:41,390
decision on whether I'm suspicious or

990
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:43,670
not I want a human to take the decision

991
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:45,529
because that's once again I find out

992
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:49,910
which is creepy I prefer humans when

993
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:54,920
when possible and the finally boarding

994
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:57,680
passes in shops in the airport it's

995
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,200
gotten worse since gdpr I don't know why

996
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,029
before gdpr I've had problems like maybe

997
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,480
20 30 percent of the times when buying

998
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:07,200
stuff in in in an airport like they they

999
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,570
ask you for the boarding pass I

1000
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,368
no thanks then they thought I didn't

1001
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:13,079
hear what they said so they repeat again

1002
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:14,849
I said no thanks and I don't wanna give

1003
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:17,520
you my boarding pass blah blah blah a

1004
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:19,500
longer one so and then they go away well

1005
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,160
then they they back off about the

1006
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,119
boarding pass

1007
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,589
now since GDP are 100 percent of time I

1008
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,300
have to call supervisor I don't know

1009
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:28,859
what's going on they're like no we have

1010
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,290
to scan because the system is made in a

1011
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:34,098
way that it won't let you let you buy

1012
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:37,560
anything so my question of course is how

1013
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:38,700
are you gonna use my name and how are

1014
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,180
you gonna use my frequent flyer number

1015
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,910
what are you going to be doing with that

1016
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:46,259
so they can never answer that question

1017
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:48,509
when you call supervisor say the system

1018
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:51,390
only stores your flight number so I say

1019
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:53,579
my flag number is BT six for one then

1020
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:55,950
they say ok supervisor knows the

1021
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:58,560
employees don't know how to track their

1022
00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:01,710
own system there so it's a bit sad so my

1023
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,720
idea coming here to this conference and

1024
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:06,480
almost not being able to buy a thing

1025
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,549
again is let's make a barcode app for

1026
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,710
shopping how about that I'm I'm on board

1027
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:12,780
I'm gonna work I'm gonna I'm gonna help

1028
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:16,020
I need some more people come talk to me

1029
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:18,240
let's make an app of course we wouldn't

1030
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:20,339
be using it to get into business

1031
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,379
launches or or or to get into an

1032
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:24,290
airplane or security zone but for

1033
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,700
shopping right so let's make an app

1034
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:28,200
where you can just just select what you

1035
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,609
need press the button show them the damn

1036
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,549
barcode and they're happy you're happy

1037
00:42:29,609 --> 00:42:37,078
everything moves along right and and

1038
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:39,990
yeah people aren't mad at you so the

1039
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:42,720
question the subtitle of the

1040
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:45,598
presentation of my talk is should we fix

1041
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,410
privacy or not so it worth it should

1042
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,960
they work on it

1043
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:53,930
well let's take a look at what have been

1044
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,930
done so far and how successful it was

1045
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,870
the user demand I mark it with a

1046
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:03,260
negative sign the users are not

1047
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:08,720
demanding privacy we have not been able

1048
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:11,510
to fix it so far too bad we had the

1049
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,759
cookie law in EU in 2012 I mark it with

1050
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:15,830
a negative sign as well that's annoying

1051
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,750
thing I don't actually know if people

1052
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:19,549
for example from the US if coming here

1053
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:21,200
and using the local or not here but

1054
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:24,290
coming to the U and using a local metal

1055
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,850
summer in the EU makes makes those

1056
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:27,200
things pop up and you don't see them at

1057
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:30,020
home or they pop up for everybody I'm

1058
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,850
not sure but in the U it's a pop-up

1059
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,430
saying hey we use cookies press ok

1060
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:38,089
so that's that's a fix and it hasn't

1061
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:42,680
fixed anything well but now this doesn't

1062
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:46,280
in we have gdpr and for big data gdpr

1063
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:49,640
hasn't fixed anything because GBP are

1064
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,980
only applies to data that can be tied to

1065
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:55,220
your identity it doesn't have to have

1066
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:58,250
your real name isn't % but it has to

1067
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:01,970
have enough real actual data to be able

1068
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:03,920
to identify that that is you big data

1069
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:06,890
doesn't qualify if they can identify

1070
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,170
that that is a male between ages of 20

1071
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:10,520
and 30 livings they're liking that that

1072
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:12,970
could be like any of the 10 males

1073
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:16,220
fitting the description so that's not

1074
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:19,279
personal data under GDP are so fail fail

1075
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:21,649
him there but GDP are in general for

1076
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,430
everything else including some online

1077
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:27,860
things and many offline things I mark it

1078
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:31,419
with a plus it has done it has a lot of

1079
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:38,270
good things so it has given me some hope

1080
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:40,400
maybe fixing privacy if it's a legal way

1081
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:43,040
to do it or it's a technical way to do

1082
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,990
it or it's a hacker way to do it maybe

1083
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,920
it's not a lost cause and maybe we

1084
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:54,759
should should just try for 6 more years

1085
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:54,760
to see what happens in 2025 thank you

1086
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:08,999
so if we have a mic here we do have a

1087
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:08,999
mic we can we can take some questions I

1088
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:15,249
can answer the first question already so

1089
00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:19,329
I'm not wearing a hoody or or a mask

1090
00:45:15,249 --> 00:45:24,759
because I consent to me being filmed we

1091
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:27,309
have the second question over there okay

1092
00:45:24,759 --> 00:45:29,259
I have a question under gdpr how do you

1093
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:31,559
know that all your data has been given

1094
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:35,529
to you I mean you have no ways to check

1095
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:38,279
yes that's true and the problem for

1096
00:45:35,529 --> 00:45:40,900
Latvia is the Data Protection Authority

1097
00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:43,029
doesn't have the right to start criminal

1098
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,920
cases and then the real Ministry of law

1099
00:45:43,029 --> 00:45:46,749
it's not really allowed just to go

1100
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:49,059
ransack in their databases in the

1101
00:45:46,749 --> 00:45:51,069
suspect company's databases so that is

1102
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:52,390
problematic maybe in some countries that

1103
00:45:51,069 --> 00:45:55,269
do have the authority and then it's easy

1104
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:57,069
but I don't have a story about that it's

1105
00:45:55,269 --> 00:45:58,118
an ongoing story death protection

1106
00:45:57,069 --> 00:46:02,380
authorities looking into it

1107
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:03,970
I do love our DPA actually when when

1108
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:06,460
they were looking for for the head of

1109
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:08,049
the DPA I had three separate friends

1110
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:11,109
mailing me saying hey apply to that

1111
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:13,960
that's your thing so but the story so I

1112
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:17,319
recently noticed that in the inter in

1113
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:19,150
the bank of my bank there's a section

1114
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:20,349
saying your date I pressed your data and

1115
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:22,359
there's just one button saying request

1116
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:24,549
your data so press the button it said in

1117
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:26,109
a week you'll get your data so a week

1118
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:27,730
later I go to the intern banks there's a

1119
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:30,910
PDF to download that download the PDF

1120
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:32,829
there's some data well but I look at it

1121
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:34,839
and it's like it's like some data I mean

1122
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:36,789
I know there is the data in the intern

1123
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:38,200
Bank itself they do not have to give it

1124
00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:39,910
in the PDF because I can access it and

1125
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,259
then there's some other data that's not

1126
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:46,538
in each intern Bank and that's in the

1127
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:49,690
PDF but I realize I know from my

1128
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:50,950
experience as as a pen tester including

1129
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:54,249
working with financial institutions that

1130
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:56,470
they have to store failed attempts for

1131
00:46:54,249 --> 00:46:59,019
credit cards and I did use credit cards

1132
00:46:56,470 --> 00:47:02,410
like 10 years ago and that wasn't

1133
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:04,238
included I know for the of the law on

1134
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:06,640
counterterrorism financing or

1135
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:10,359
counter-financing the third

1136
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:12,910
that they have to store a photo of my

1137
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:15,430
face and a photo of my ID and it's not

1138
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:18,700
including either so that's an easy case

1139
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:20,230
I go to the DPA and I go to the

1140
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,629
financial Commission I said I say to

1141
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:24,519
them so either they broke gdpr by not

1142
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:27,069
leaving the data were they breaking the

1143
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:29,758
tourism law by not stirring my data so

1144
00:47:27,069 --> 00:47:37,589
now they have to make a choice

1145
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:37,589
sometimes that happens yep

1146
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:44,610
so about that Facebook algorithm you

1147
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:46,770
mentioned one for suicide prevention do

1148
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:49,770
you think it reads also the private

1149
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:51,390
messaging or just publicly post date oh

1150
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:52,770
I think it's very the private messaging

1151
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:56,240
and I don't think it's the only

1152
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:56,240
algorithm betrays a private message yeah

1153
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:04,860
can I get them can get the mic to the

1154
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:06,569
comment guy does a plot for those guy I

1155
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:10,200
have two friends that work on that

1156
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:13,320
suicide prevention team in Facebook and

1157
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,910
it reads absolutely everything including

1158
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,950
and that this is just this is not

1159
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:18,660
specific to them face book reads

1160
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:20,189
messages that you never even send like

1161
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:22,770
it reads things that you type into text

1162
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:24,180
fields and then erase so it's all it's

1163
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:25,500
all part of the machine and I've told

1164
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,879
both those friends that they're working

1165
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,940
for a bad company and they should quit

1166
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,180
and I advise anyone to tell that to

1167
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:35,600
their friends who work for Facebook to

1168
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:35,600
okay some more questions

1169
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:45,839
hi so thank you for your talk two points

1170
00:48:41,729 --> 00:48:50,220
one is that I got an Apple iPhone from

1171
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:51,960
my work as a business mobile and I had

1172
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:55,738
the same problem I didn't want to create

1173
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:57,299
a personalized and entity and I didn't

1174
00:48:55,739 --> 00:48:58,950
want to give my credit card stuff like

1175
00:48:57,299 --> 00:49:01,349
that so I bought in the trip in a

1176
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:03,779
business trip in Germany to Apple gift

1177
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:06,900
cards and when I go back to Greece I

1178
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:09,660
couldn't use them because my Apple

1179
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:13,859
identity was register in Greece so I

1180
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:18,618
cannot use that so the workaround of

1181
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:21,720
thought is I created a second anonymous

1182
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:26,309
account register in Germany to use the

1183
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:28,558
Germany Apple gift cards to to my phone

1184
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:30,839
so I don't know if that is the case with

1185
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,859
you because a gift card then you

1186
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:34,049
encounter transfer to a different

1187
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:35,910
country user and then use it yeah gift

1188
00:49:34,049 --> 00:49:38,190
card yeah yeah that's the other thing I

1189
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:40,140
mean I got the same thing with what's

1190
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:41,789
that a similar thing is what's up but in

1191
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:44,848
in Latvia we can't even have a

1192
00:49:41,789 --> 00:49:46,650
possibility to buy prepaid prepaid Apple

1193
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:49,859
cards so we don't have that problem

1194
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:52,259
yeah and the second thing I'd like to

1195
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:56,308
have your opinion in Greece there's a no

1196
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:59,670
but the CPS the Reuters that the ISPs

1197
00:49:56,309 --> 00:50:03,690
gives to customers and now they cannot

1198
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:06,989
change the DNS settings of the router so

1199
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:09,479
they have to be it's a gray text post of

1200
00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:13,109
the ISPs should only provide to the

1201
00:50:09,479 --> 00:50:16,950
customers their own DNS services this is

1202
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:20,989
under regulation law so the customers

1203
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:23,609
cannot visiting sites that are not

1204
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:25,799
approved from a government yeah

1205
00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:29,359
if you know you intend to the initial

1206
00:50:25,799 --> 00:50:31,799
settings on your computer of course but

1207
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:33,058
what do you think about this is this

1208
00:50:31,799 --> 00:50:35,549
something about privacy

1209
00:50:33,059 --> 00:50:37,140
do we need to I don't know make a

1210
00:50:35,549 --> 00:50:39,960
statement do something else

1211
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:41,038
well my first reaction was that cannot

1212
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,719
be a law but you seem to know what

1213
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,499
you're saying so if it's a law it's a

1214
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:45,509
law

1215
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:46,799
i I don't think that's a good idea but

1216
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:48,660
there are multiple ways to circumvent

1217
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:50,339
that right you could you could tell the

1218
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,020
the telecom company I don't want your

1219
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,670
stuff in my house

1220
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:54,980
so they put it in the in the corridor

1221
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:57,290
not in your house and you can always

1222
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,670
change route errs right they can have

1223
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:00,440
the router you can have your router so

1224
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:02,960
in that scenario

1225
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,970
and and I mean I've had similar things

1226
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,100
in Latvia working of working with

1227
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:12,439
consulting clients and to make their

1228
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:14,720
life more safer so we don't have that

1229
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:18,950
law but still I space push for that they

1230
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:20,959
want their stuff on your premises so I

1231
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:22,609
have multi multi step program which will

1232
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,980
not work if it's a legal requirement or

1233
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:27,170
it might so the multi step program is as

1234
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:28,640
follows I ask that be nicely to please

1235
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:30,230
remove or remove the router because

1236
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,830
we're going to put our own router if

1237
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:36,950
they don't cooperate we we just put our

1238
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:39,470
own router after their router and then

1239
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:42,680
if the router has Wi-Fi antennas which

1240
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:46,250
is a problem then we once again ask them

1241
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,750
nicely to remove the router what are we

1242
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:50,750
gonna break off the demo tense and short

1243
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:52,960
them and and I've done that for four

1244
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,960
clients

1245
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,310
yeah more questions

1246
00:52:08,369 --> 00:52:14,010
first thank you for the good

1247
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:17,029
presentation if I understand well gdpr

1248
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:21,930
is used to protect my personal data that

1249
00:52:17,029 --> 00:52:29,450
can be linked to me and what happens if

1250
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:36,680
say a big company can stalk or buy data

1251
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:43,710
in which the data that is accumulated so

1252
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:46,019
that it can be linked to me so well

1253
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:47,789
yeah so GD pair for big data that's

1254
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:50,519
that's a problem we haven't we haven't

1255
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:53,220
fixed that but I mean as soon as I have

1256
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:54,598
your email address many DPAs in in

1257
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,879
different European countries say that's

1258
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:58,500
that's already identifiable it helps to

1259
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,630
have your full name your email address

1260
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:03,329
than that then you know then it then it

1261
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:06,180
works for example I am working on a

1262
00:53:03,329 --> 00:53:08,730
complaint where where someone has is

1263
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:11,308
referencing my domain in their latest

1264
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:14,490
work and since it has been my domain for

1265
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:16,200
15 or 20 years and when you open the

1266
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:19,169
webpage actually says that's my full

1267
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,669
name that's my email address so I'm kind

1268
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:23,759
of trying to put them into the direction

1269
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:25,589
that it is that is private data but yeah

1270
00:53:23,759 --> 00:53:27,839
for big data in general there's there's

1271
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:29,460
nothing we can do under GDP or if if

1272
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:32,160
it's not identifiable it's actually I

1273
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:35,339
don't know if we still have time for for

1274
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,359
questions what do you think five minutes

1275
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:40,019
okay

1276
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:42,839
yeah so couple more questions about how

1277
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:48,140
to make your life harder by by being

1278
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:53,250
private what's your experience with the

1279
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:55,618
GDP our entity in in your country are

1280
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:58,460
they are they complete are they

1281
00:53:55,619 --> 00:54:02,130
adequately staffed are they adequately

1282
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:05,009
knowledgeable because in my home country

1283
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:08,039
this this is a big mess so GDP is

1284
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:10,920
basically a lot because they have they

1285
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:13,440
can't do anything oh yeah so GDP our

1286
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:15,750
rent entities responsible for GDP are in

1287
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,920
in European countries are called data

1288
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:21,369
protection authorities or DPAs

1289
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:24,670
our DPA is not adequately staffed but at

1290
00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:27,910
least they finally have a good a good

1291
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:30,430
leader a good a good head of the DPA but

1292
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:32,290
they do have problem with staffing and I

1293
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:35,078
haven't I haven't worked with them for

1294
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:36,910
for I think two years now but I just

1295
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:40,480
recently about a months ago which is the

1296
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:42,040
the window they had replying to you I

1297
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,920
haven't I haven't sentence it to them

1298
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:47,440
but now I have sent a bunch so what they

1299
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:49,510
have been doing two years ago I think I

1300
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,549
still can do that when a month passes

1301
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:54,430
they send you a letter saying we

1302
00:54:51,549 --> 00:54:55,900
apologize we cannot answer right now we

1303
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:58,180
extend the deadline there is a provision

1304
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,829
says I can do that but it cannot be

1305
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:02,169
because of understaffing it's because

1306
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:03,910
they have to collect more data so

1307
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:05,200
technically at least by Latin law I

1308
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:07,569
could go to court and challenge that

1309
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,490
extension and I've asked the previous

1310
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:11,049
head of the DPA do you want me to do

1311
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:12,339
that because I can do that the court can

1312
00:55:11,049 --> 00:55:15,130
rule in my favor and then you can go to

1313
00:55:12,339 --> 00:55:17,230
the government ask for money but they

1314
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:19,059
said no so I haven't tested the current

1315
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:20,290
head of the DPA if that's if that's what

1316
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:21,940
they want because if I want I'll do that

1317
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:24,308
and maybe maybe we get some money for

1318
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:26,910
that but it's not a priority financially

1319
00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:26,910
yeah that's true

1320
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:34,990
right so you can ask me some more

1321
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:37,300
questions if you manage to find me in in

1322
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:39,819
the conference somewhere and thanks

1323
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:42,460
follow me on Twitter the slides are on

1324
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:46,050

1325
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:46,050
