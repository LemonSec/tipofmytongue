1
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:38,340
next up known and less known methods of

2
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:42,480
user tracking by dense turbot hello

3
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,930
everyone so the topic of my talk today

4
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,640
is may be misleading but I'll let you be

5
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:53,430
the judge of it idea is to go through

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:58,350
methods available don't go into too much

7
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:02,540
technical details discuss why it's

8
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:08,520
important and why it matters and also

9
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:10,320
I'll just a at the end I'll focus on one

10
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,869
normal method which is interesting to me

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,529
and I've been working a lot with it

12
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:19,530
that's DNS cache based user tracking

13
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:23,070
which is interesting because you don't

14
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,490
need browser and you can abuse cache on

15
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,880
your PC to store sensitive data or in

16
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,908
this case unique cookie which identifies

17
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,600
user it works cross browser in private

18
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:41,030
mode and so on but we will get to that

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:44,520
so Who am I well slide says it all

20
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:46,820
lately I've been mostly working with

21
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,280
machine learning on edge devices

22
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:53,908
especially an anomaly detection in area

23
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,899
of industrial control systems feel free

24
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:03,179
to ping me why this talk today and in

25
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:05,640
general interest in area of privacy that

26
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:08,280
goes to my limited government and

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,190
political transparency a democracy I was

28
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:15,150
involved in Mozilla and in European

29
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:18,030
students for liberty now let's start

30
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,890
with questions do you have something to

31
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,330
hide who has something to hide

32
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,329
like we see your hands

33
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:31,170
okay do you care about your privacy

34
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:35,069
online privacy and privacy in general or

35
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:42,060
you don't care who cares let me see your

36
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:44,129
hands okay good and are you taking any

37
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,319
actions about your privacy are you

38
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:50,970
trying to my I mean what are you doing

39
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,858
to try to hide your activity let's say

40
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:57,620
let's put it that way

41
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:57,620
any volunteers to share your experience

42
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,600
okay

43
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,110
psst

44
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:19,920
okay so all these ones that okay the guy

45
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,920
were there also

46
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:31,700
well okay let's move forward then so

47
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:35,480
whatever you do it leaves obviously

48
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:38,329
digital footprints it goes on multiple

49
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,959
levels from ISP providers their

50
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,970
infrastructure DNS servers I mean people

51
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,530
believe if they use for example Google

52
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,650
servers they're fine some of them

53
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,840
believe CloudFlare is fine but nothing

54
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:55,340
this secure and data is being collected

55
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:58,040
and you can be pinpointed also uh quite

56
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,100
big threat and we all use them our

57
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,859
public Wi-Fi hotspots because not only

58
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:07,459
they collect data about you they can get

59
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:10,220
data which uniquely identifies your

60
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:15,160
hardware devices for example but also

61
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:19,728
they can inject contents they can inject

62
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:22,040
ads they can collect what you did what

63
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:24,320
you looked into over there public

64
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,930
networks and they can share those data

65
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,550
usually things that are free there's a

66
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,970
reason why those things are free

67
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:35,060
ecommerce sites some of us probably like

68
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:37,940
the fact that recommendation engines are

69
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:41,810
doing their job some of you don't like

70
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:44,690
it wearable devices and IOT devices are

71
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,060
even worse because for example these

72
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:50,270
devices on my hand is measuring my heart

73
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:53,510
rate and that's pretty valuable data for

74
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:55,909
example for insurance companies I don't

75
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:58,760
even I don't even need to know that they

76
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:01,310
shared data but when I come to insurance

77
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,530
company and ask for insurance they'll

78
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:07,310
probably have leverage on me without me

79
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:09,859
even knowing it so that's not fun news

80
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,160
portals are also quite interesting

81
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,190
especially now when fake news these

82
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:20,690
informational similar things are popular

83
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:23,120
let's say so by collecting information

84
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:26,030
about you on the news portals news

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,710
portals are usually linked to social

86
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:33,799
networks pretty interesting profiles can

87
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:37,080
be built and they can be and they are

88
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,600
used in marketing purposes we

89
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:44,490
is let's say normal but they can also be

90
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:48,930
used to to interfere for example in

91
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:54,120
election processes and also one let's

92
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:56,430
say quite primitive example electric

93
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,000
consumption patterns I'm pretty sure

94
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:06,720
that my pattern is quite different than

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,669
anyone else here in the room so data is

96
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,630
everywhere we are living digital

97
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:15,960
footprints everywhere so yesterday we

98
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:20,520
heard the talk where GSM devices or

99
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:24,810
tracking devices were discussed but they

100
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,479
are the tip of the iceberg actually so

101
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:31,289
as a result of all the data and all the

102
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:35,789
digital footprints left there's a bunch

103
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:41,009
of data collected and that could

104
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:45,680
potentially or usually is a problem so

105
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:49,229
some of the most known let's say

106
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:53,219
examples of let's say misuse of data are

107
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:57,330
Cambridge L analytical okay here's the

108
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:59,460
example which breaks it but also I mean

109
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,130
it's not chemical everyone is talking

110
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,080
about Cambridge analytical but if you

111
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:08,070
ask me Cambridge analytical itself is

112
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,650
not a problem I mean Obama during his

113
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,520
elections he used Facebook he used data

114
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,060
from Facebook

115
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,330
he had data scientists he had big

116
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,669
infrastructure so he was also using all

117
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:24,300
the technology available to try to win

118
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:25,830
now in Trump did basically is the same

119
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,949
thing now it's the problem and now

120
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:31,198
everybody talks about it of course it's

121
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:33,990
something to be discussed and it's

122
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,509
something that's questionable but the

123
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,159
thing is that not only the Trump or

124
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:42,500
brexit are the problem because we don't

125
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:46,589
like it the problem is bigger than that

126
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:49,219
so other example would be for an

127
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:53,149
election interference so

128
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:55,869
on the internet I mean to have access to

129
00:07:53,149 --> 00:08:00,199
some of the data I mentioned in earlier

130
00:07:55,869 --> 00:08:03,800
they'll post us you don't have to have

131
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:06,949
access to ice P providers to be

132
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,909
government to ask big corporations for

133
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:14,929
access because most of the useful data

134
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:17,389
for some of the use cases is already

135
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:19,638
left on the internet you're posting on

136
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:22,849
Twitter you're commenting news portals

137
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,050
use your comic you're liking things on

138
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:26,449
the Internet

139
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,379
you're leaving comments when they're

140
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:32,688
reading or buying things and so on so

141
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:34,969
things are openly telling the wild and

142
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:35,299
whoever wants and have resources to do

143
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:38,240
it

144
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:41,508
can collect that data and cut it can

145
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,560
extract knowledge out of it and if you

146
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:49,100
want use it against you also here is

147
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,680
example with this information which is

148
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:58,699
quite interesting in these times for

149
00:08:51,680 --> 00:09:02,180
example nowadays you can model built

150
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:04,459
built all reality for each person who's

151
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:07,310
an own Internet you can do that through

152
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:10,420
targeting him with special specially

153
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:14,050
crafted ads and you can also do it by

154
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:19,550
modifying sites one project I worked on

155
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:22,639
we used so we were collecting on one

156
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:27,258
ecommerce site a bunch of data on users

157
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:29,769
users were uniquely identified and once

158
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:33,620
we had enough data we were able to

159
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:36,649
modify content user sees before pages

160
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,839
loaded so basically if you or you or

161
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:42,529
someone else access this page we were on

162
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:45,170
the page before everything was from the

163
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:48,649
design from the content was adapted for

164
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:51,019
your preference and that can be done in

165
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:56,019
real time you don't notice anything is

166
00:09:51,019 --> 00:10:00,470
going on so that's pretty creepy and

167
00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:05,120
that that's for example what was

168
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:10,040
extremely abused during Trump political

169
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:12,680
campaign and in past days I've heard

170
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:17,029
everyone is against government that's

171
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:19,609
fine but the government is not the only

172
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:21,560
issue I mean you have big corporations

173
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:25,129
you have different interest groups and

174
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:27,670
pretty much any of them is interested in

175
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:33,529
your data and would like to gain

176
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:35,290
something out of it so thing is not only

177
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:39,740
government is the problem

178
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:42,579
so some say that data is power or toxic

179
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:48,709
waste or new oil it depends again on the

180
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:51,439
viewpoint but the thing is that what

181
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:54,589
people don't understand at least most of

182
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:56,889
them probably you do is that once you

183
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:59,899
have a bunch of data you can get

184
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:00,199
information of valuable knowledge out of

185
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:03,949
it

186
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:06,620
so you may think it's irrelevant if you

187
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:08,660
like some page but it is relevant

188
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:12,850
especially for someone who is for

189
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:17,000
example looking into for example public

190
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:19,279
party public page they're interested in

191
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,029
likes they're interested in sentiment so

192
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,430
how people are reacting to things they

193
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:27,050
are publishing and so on and that's all

194
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,569
valuable information that's valuable

195
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,849
information for PR companies that's

196
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:33,759
valuable information for foreign

197
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,170
governments that that's valuable

198
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:40,189
information probably for some other

199
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:43,849
companies who can get a leverage out of

200
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:45,980
it now all data contains knowledge and

201
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:50,319
knowledge can be used and abused that's

202
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:54,740
how things go and that's something

203
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:59,599
normal we should not run away from the

204
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:02,120
devices we should not be angry about it

205
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:07,759
we simply need to be aware of it and we

206
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:11,270
simply need to I mean once you get aware

207
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:14,600
that how things works

208
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:16,850
for example someone who wants to abuse

209
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,649
you cannot use the same trick so if

210
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,430
people start to ask themselves and they

211
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:26,450
see some for example news is this they

212
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:31,219
start to question things that are listed

213
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:33,320
aspects at that moment fake news and

214
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,990
this information won't be the problem ok

215
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,630
that's not trivial to achieve but that's

216
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:41,980
in if you ask me a solution to this

217
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:45,470
problem so some of the attempts to keep

218
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:48,140
privacy on the internet and to try to

219
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:51,050
avoid being tracked and you'll get that

220
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:55,660
data being used against you are listed

221
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:59,449
here none of them is perfect and

222
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:02,779
honestly I'm not sure if it's worth it

223
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:05,959
even to use it for example one example

224
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:10,630
people people usually prefer to use is

225
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:13,010
VPN and VPN is for far far away from

226
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:16,670
silver bullet sees here are some

227
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,480
examples also guys in previous talk had

228
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:22,910
good points

229
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:25,940
so 99 VPN products are run by same 23

230
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:29,329
companies other interesting thing is

231
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:32,180
that I mean if the VPN servers are in

232
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:35,359
China and Russia or Russia I mean if

233
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,010
they ask you for data you will give it I

234
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,740
mean that goes by default they are

235
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:42,439
sharing data with governments and also

236
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,540
it's in interest of foreign governments

237
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,550
to get people to use VPNs that are

238
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,160
hosted in their their countries

239
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:54,199
here's the example with us where

240
00:13:49,160 --> 00:14:00,260
senators are discussing to put more

241
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:03,110
control into how things will be how they

242
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:06,250
will control their citizens how they use

243
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:09,079
VPN servers because they tend to use

244
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,540
Russian VPN servers and mass traffic is

245
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:14,689
out of United States ok they know they

246
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,579
cannot get to it let's say but foreign

247
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:21,800
governments have that data and they can

248
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:23,040
abuse it and conduct statewide attacks

249
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,609
and so on

250
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:31,889
so whatever you do you can run but you

251
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:35,610
can't hide you can I mean the thing is

252
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:37,740
that okay you will stay anonymous to

253
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:40,230
some point but you'll be uniquely

254
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,779
identified you will be uniquely

255
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:47,160
identified by the data you will generate

256
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:49,649
generate in the process not only that

257
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,380
that's that that's usually data you

258
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:54,779
generate using electronic devices and so

259
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:58,500
on but there's one other thing and

260
00:14:54,779 --> 00:15:03,510
that's behavioral patterns the way I use

261
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:06,779
my mouse the bay the way I the order in

262
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:09,420
which I search for the content on the

263
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:11,459
Internet the way I type that's

264
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:15,120
everything what identifies me and makes

265
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:19,739
me unique and the thing is that you can

266
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:23,910
combine all the data you have and then

267
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:26,910
you are unique for sure and then the and

268
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:31,529
then it's only a matter of time when

269
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:35,779
your anonymous unique ID will be unified

270
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:39,769
with your real name with your real ID I

271
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:42,720
mean people are creatures of habit and

272
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:46,430
sooner or later you will fail

273
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:51,149
I mean if as we saw in yesterday's talk

274
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:53,579
CIA CIA agents fail intelligence agents

275
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:57,810
fail I don't see a reason why wouldn't

276
00:15:53,579 --> 00:16:01,399
normal everyday people fail so the

277
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:05,189
question is should we return to caves or

278
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:09,350
should we fight it what do you think who

279
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,350
thinks that we should return to caves

280
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:18,760
excellent okay so again this is a battle

281
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:22,720
between good and evil and good and evil

282
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:26,350
is in the eye of the viewer again laws

283
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,540
may help but I don't believe in laws in

284
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,300
the way that they can prevent such

285
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:33,699
things and they can prevent abuse so I

286
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:37,109
don't think that's the solution I like I

287
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:39,940
said I think that key are the people and

288
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:43,420
transparency on how we are tracked

289
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:47,200
what's done with our data and raising

290
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:49,930
awareness amongst people on that topic

291
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:53,470
so we should definitely move forward I

292
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:55,839
mean the amount of data we collect and

293
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:59,350
all the knowledge that's generated out

294
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:02,680
of it is also good it's not only abused

295
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:07,870
for bad purposes so we just need to keep

296
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:11,438
that in mind so the main idea of this

297
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:15,790
talk was to give some overview of

298
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:19,660
browser tracking since browsers are

299
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:21,520
basically our home when we are online so

300
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,209
everything starts and everything goes in

301
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,389
browsers as you probably know once you

302
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:31,240
visit some site you're obvious to not

303
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:33,120
just contacted a contacting that site

304
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:37,390
your data is being shared between

305
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:40,679
multiple sites here's example of a light

306
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:45,070
beam project by Mozilla which basically

307
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:48,700
add-on that collects data and presents

308
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:52,120
it to user tracking usually works

309
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:54,600
through JavaScript injected code which

310
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,860
is fine you can try and disable

311
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,040
JavaScript there are some other ways you

312
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,240
can be tracked but the thing is that

313
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:05,110
javascript is not only used for tracking

314
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,390
it's basically used for everything on

315
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:12,520
the internet and nowadays if you disable

316
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:17,809
for example JavaScript you mean webpages

317
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:20,139
and the content is useless so

318
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:23,960
I will just mention and go through

319
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:28,309
details of some of the methods here's

320
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:31,159
the list so the most used one is

321
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:32,928
definitely pixel tags they're pretty

322
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:37,969
much everywhere everywhere

323
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:41,539
most of us use HTML for emails and these

324
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:44,299
pixel tags are basically transparent

325
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:47,809
single pixel links to the images which

326
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:51,469
are embedded into into email content you

327
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:57,289
open email that pixel is loaded and it

328
00:18:51,469 --> 00:19:01,249
reveals a lot of data about you other

329
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:03,919
quite popular method is finger printing

330
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:07,249
and focusing focuses on device

331
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:10,219
fingerprinting you can get again a bunch

332
00:19:07,249 --> 00:19:14,589
of different data especially interesting

333
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:20,269
for me is when I mean you cannot use it

334
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:23,629
in every example but finger printing by

335
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:26,450
the lens dust on camera is pretty

336
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:28,728
interesting approach and it's especially

337
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:31,129
interesting for example if you're using

338
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:33,649
Instagram I'm pretty sure they're using

339
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:35,509
this method to get more information

340
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:37,899
about you

341
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:41,779
one more advanced let's say

342
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:44,928
fingerprinting method is bringing

343
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:47,539
fingerprinting by canvas so basically

344
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:50,629
you generate a canvas image with short

345
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:54,559
text and that's rendering in the

346
00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:56,748
background based on on your hardware

347
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,570
your heart that you have based on a

348
00:19:56,749 --> 00:20:03,830
version of browser based on phones you

349
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:07,059
have and some other things times of a

350
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:10,960
render are different and that basically

351
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:14,178
reveals you and makes you unique

352
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:20,389
behavioral fingerprinting like I said

353
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:23,659
earlier so when tracking system is

354
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:28,549
integrated on the web page among other

355
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:29,670
things pages are collected how long you

356
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:32,340
stay on each

357
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:35,880
how much how long you stay on each page

358
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:38,580
is collected mouse movements heat maps

359
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,340
are made scrolling speed is looked into

360
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:44,820
if you leave any comments that's later

361
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:49,980
on unified with all the data previously

362
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:54,659
connected so with combination of all the

363
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:57,270
methods at some point you are really

364
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,600
really really uniquely identified and

365
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:03,750
then is the matter of time you will log

366
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,540
into some page or you'll do something

367
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:09,179
that will connect you with your

368
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:11,668
personality with your ID the thing is

369
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:15,030
that even if you're uniquely ID that's

370
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:17,330
useful information because you can again

371
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:20,910
be classified in different groups and

372
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:25,379
attackers or whoever wants to use this

373
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:30,660
leverage can target these groups so that

374
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:32,700
information is not user useless so once

375
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:36,179
you're identified you need to be marked

376
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:39,090
somehow and they try to mark you in

377
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:43,410
permanent way to do so the most popular

378
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:45,418
method is cookies so cookies there are

379
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:47,820
different types of cookies you have

380
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:51,720
super cookies several cookies

381
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:54,960
standard cookies and so on but the thing

382
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,470
is conceptually they are the same the

383
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,890
only difference is that some cookies are

384
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:04,049
more persistent than others so this

385
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:08,120
super cookies a never cook is there

386
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:10,679
abusing different types of storages

387
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:15,090
there are some of them are working in

388
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:18,600
combination with back-end there are

389
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:22,470
attempts that each user want once he's

390
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:26,899
identified he gets certificate for

391
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:33,200
himself so that's quite permanent and

392
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:37,410
one let's say normal of normal no way of

393
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:41,480
marking you is abusing DNS cache on your

394
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:45,200
PC regarding this

395
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:47,840
abuse of DNS cache basically you can

396
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,019
create I mean there are different ways

397
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:56,689
how to implement it you can have fixed

398
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:58,940
for example DNS records and then you use

399
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:01,789
different combinations of those

400
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:05,450
available already available DNS records

401
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:09,139
to create unique IDs unique patterns for

402
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:11,750
your users other way is to simply create

403
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:15,639
unique DNS record per user okay there

404
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:18,169
are some downsides for it but today

405
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:19,519
technology technological technological

406
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:22,730
XP

407
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:26,570
this is possible and this is definitely

408
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:31,580
a threat and method which for sure will

409
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:36,320
be used in coming days one thing with

410
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:38,840
DNS cache is that DNS cache don't care

411
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,980
about private browsers different

412
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,590
browsers

413
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:47,419
it's simply on your computer ok there's

414
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:51,889
a difference between how that local

415
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:54,980
cache works but the thing is that it's

416
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:58,428
cached it can be refreshed and so on so

417
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:01,880
it's really hard to get rid of it and of

418
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:05,600
course disabling cache is that doesn't

419
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,789
make sense so you need to live with it

420
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,689
one other thing is that once you're

421
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:14,629
marked with DNS cookie let's call it

422
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:17,690
that way there is no concept of first or

423
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:20,000
third party party cookies so with HTTP

424
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,760
cookies for example a Facebook can't

425
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,730
access other cookies in your storage but

426
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:29,419
with DNS cache if someone knows how to

427
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:32,389
do it he can access that information so

428
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:34,880
basically you can be cross-site tracked

429
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:38,510
once you are marked with this DNS

430
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,389
cooking it can also be used outside

431
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,980
browser environment so whatever you do

432
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:49,639
on the Internet you are sending a bunch

433
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:53,120
of DNS lookups so you you are on the

434
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:54,629
internet you can be marked and you can

435
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,289
get stored this

436
00:24:54,630 --> 00:25:02,760
DNS cookie also this DNS cookies are

437
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:06,600
also as an interesting useful they are

438
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:11,059
usually used in videos mitigation but I

439
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:14,340
think there have more success to be

440
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:18,149
think that's being abused

441
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:20,850
of course limitations are time to live

442
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:23,520
you can set time to live on your DNS

443
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:28,649
cooking and usually it works from my

444
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:31,440
experience so far up to 24 hours but it

445
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:36,950
depends Chrome browser has different

446
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:43,679
internal policy on how long they keep on

447
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:46,409
respecting TTL and DNS cache behavior is

448
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:52,320
different on different operating systems

449
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:55,650
and so on so the method can be used but

450
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:59,100
you cannot rely 100% on it you need to

451
00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:03,360
combine it with other methods and that's

452
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:06,689
usually what checking companies are

453
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,820
doing local networks behave because we

454
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:11,880
are all behind the net

455
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:16,110
you usually complicates things

456
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:19,049
but despite that you can pinpoint

457
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:23,490
different people on the same network and

458
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:28,889
uniquely identify them on this method

459
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:32,070
there are very few public resources so

460
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:34,650
it's interesting ground for work at the

461
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:41,490
moment I've been playing a lot with it

462
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:44,400
but it's still work-in-progress I'm

463
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:47,880
especially trying to hunt down some big

464
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:51,480
company who's already who's already

465
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:55,380
implemented this kind of tracking but so

466
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:59,539
far I didn't find any but I guess they

467
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:02,309
will that will change in near future and

468
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:03,920
more technical details on the

469
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:06,680
implementation

470
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,480
variations of this approach and so on

471
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:13,140
will be saved for some of their upcoming

472
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:17,210
talks well thank you for listening and

473
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,210
if any questions shoot

474
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:31,750
any questions

475
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:57,980
what is the best way to spoof browser

476
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:59,150
fingerprinting every time you use you do

477
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,520
something on the Internet

478
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:10,010
that's probably the best way to do it

479
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:12,920
other way to do it okay but doing that

480
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:16,330
on network level intercepting traffic

481
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:19,760
and modifying you you can prevent

482
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:22,730
memories collecting data on you to not

483
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:26,720
get some amount of data but still they

484
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:28,850
will get enough to pinpoint you I mean

485
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,559
that's done on multiple levels so it's

486
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:35,990
really hard to fight it especially with

487
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:39,760
this DNS think unique DNS cookies can be

488
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:43,850
okay obviously some garbage some hash

489
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:46,010
some hash and they can also be some

490
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,199
meaningful names so if you want to do

491
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:51,799
for example what was what I was trying

492
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,790
to do I was looking into a DNS cache and

493
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:59,480
I was trying to using machine learning

494
00:28:54,790 --> 00:29:01,879
filter out suspicious DNS records but

495
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,730
that's not bulletproof

496
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,740
because whomever is generating them can

497
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,169
use meaningful names especially now when

498
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:14,330
you have a bunch of CD ends you can say

499
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:16,870
okay this this DNS is something with the

500
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:19,850
debt needs content delivery network and

501
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:22,809
whatever you know so it's really hard

502
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,809
okay thanks

503
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:33,210
so if you run your own DNS caching on

504
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,639
your machine just for like resolving

505
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:38,429
everything you do and you set it to be

506
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:40,678
like a long time maybe the 48 hours or

507
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:44,009
so or maybe longer or random for

508
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:46,889
different addresses would that be like a

509
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:49,409
way around this so your DNS queries

510
00:29:46,889 --> 00:29:53,850
don't go out as often or as predictable

511
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:58,169
that would help in a way but also you're

512
00:29:53,850 --> 00:30:02,820
affecting your let's say experience

513
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:05,789
overall experience and again there are

514
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:09,539
different methods that they are used to

515
00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:12,210
pinpoint you so anyone who's trying to

516
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:16,259
track you won't store just one type of

517
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:18,600
cookie so even if you refresh DNS they

518
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:21,480
will check ok if it's in it it's not in

519
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,820
DNS cache let's put it again in it same

520
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:29,249
goes for browsers and so on

521
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:32,149
so again not 100% that you'll run away

522
00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:32,149
from these methods

523
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,199
any other questions

524
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,658
well thank you and see you at the rock

525
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:01,659
Alex

526
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,190
you
