1
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:40,010
next up is max mail with no IT security

2
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:41,470
without free software yeah yeah by Khan

3
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,870
thank you very much for having me here

4
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:47,510
my name is Max Mia I am from the Free

5
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,860
Software Foundation Europe and today I

6
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,070
would like to talk with you a little bit

7
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:55,820
about the interplay between IT security

8
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:58,339
and free software that's an interesting

9
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,559
field because normally if you speak to

10
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:03,170
normal people security is more like

11
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,050
something in the hidden kept secret and

12
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,610
not talking about it ideally but free

13
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:11,210
software is the complete opposite it's

14
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:13,370
it's open its transparent so we will

15
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,460
together take a look at how this works

16
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:20,510
together and how openness can contribute

17
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:23,470
to security after all but first of all I

18
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:26,420
have to give you a little bit of context

19
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:28,490
because this is not an average tech

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,480
conference bachlin is quite a tea

21
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,460
security-related

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,200
so I guess most people of you will

23
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,750
understand I will know the word IT

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,400
security that's something and you will

25
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,830
probably think why should I what will I

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,110
learn about here and about 80 security

27
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,030
why we are already at a conference we

28
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:50,120
have so many exciting talks about

29
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:53,690
specific security related issues take

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:57,080
place well the thing is react the Free

31
00:01:53,690 --> 00:02:01,130
Software Foundation Europe in the last

32
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,890
recent 18 years now

33
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:06,740
we spoke to so many people who are

34
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:10,068
completely out of the hole technology

35
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,480
bubble that we are in year right now so

36
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:13,879
we spoke to people who have no idea

37
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,119
about technology at all who live

38
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:20,030
basically on another planet and well

39
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,670
while this is not a bad thing because

40
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,280
there is also other roads outside of our

41
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,958
technology bubble so we developed some

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,780
kind of different understanding of how

43
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,130
those fields how those different planets

44
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:36,050
work and thing actually so we started to

45
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:38,450
see something like the bigger picture

46
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,220
another picture that those people see

47
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,640
when they speak about technology and

48
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:46,490
about at ISA cuit II specifically so

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,529
what I will cover today is more like IT

50
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:51,050
security and free software on a meter

51
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,480
level on a more bigger picture level

52
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,220
that sounds really great but it might be

53
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,250
just a little bit different than what

54
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,800
you would expect today so today I won't

55
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:04,030
be speaking be speaking about concrete

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,440
measurements about specific security

57
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,970
precautions that you would have to take

58
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,160
or that someone else would have to take

59
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:13,340
so that we all live in the safer world

60
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,810
but I hope I can give you a more general

61
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,380
approach and the more general

62
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:21,200
understanding of how we can in the

63
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:24,440
bigger picture overall improve IT

64
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:28,250
security at least safety in our daily

65
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,800
lives in our six societies so big words

66
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,570
but let's get started with the basics so

67
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,390
first of all a little bit about myself

68
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,670
and the office of e we are a charity

69
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:41,149
that empowers users to control

70
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:42,708
technology so we are user focused we

71
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,130
care about the user's individual

72
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:49,310
freedoms and that we all as a society

73
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:51,590
and as individuals are able to control

74
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,950
technology that we understand technology

75
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:58,820
that we can take an influence taken

76
00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:01,549
stands for for technology and that we

77
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:05,680
can have trust in it that's one of our

78
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:08,840
goals and the big goals and then another

79
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,700
basic information about free software

80
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,470
probably all of you heard about free

81
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:17,779
software at least once but just to be on

82
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:21,820
the safe side so free software is

83
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:24,950
defined by the four essential freedoms

84
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,599
the first freedom that a free software

85
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,490
project that the free software has to

86
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,610
bring here is the freedom to use the

87
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,430
software for any purpose so without any

88
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:37,790
restrictions so you can use it for your

89
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:40,550
personal usage for a business you can

90
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:42,260
lose it even for military purposes free

91
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,150
software gives you all the freedoms to

92
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,000
use the software for any purpose that's

93
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,068
great because so many other non-free

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,770
software restricts the use

95
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:53,659
and it's for example not allowed to be

96
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,969
installed or run in schools or

97
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:57,169
businesses

98
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,710
the second freedom is the freedom to

99
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:02,240
study the software so you or anyone else

100
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:05,270
can take a look at the source code and

101
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,949
understand how it works that's quite

102
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,289
important because well that's the recipe

103
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:13,069
how are free software how a computing

104
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:15,919
mechanism is working the third freedom

105
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:18,620
is to freedom to share a software so if

106
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,799
you have a free software you can give it

107
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:25,580
to anyone to your friends to your school

108
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,800
to the university to someone you don't

109
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,120
even like the good thing is or the

110
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,810
interesting thing is that the price

111
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,569
doesn't matter

112
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:35,210
many people confuse that free software

113
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:38,090
is not about the price you can earn

114
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,948
money with free software the only thing

115
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,780
is that it should not restrict that it

116
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:44,750
must not restrict any of those four

117
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:47,119
freedoms and the fourth freedom is the

118
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,460
freedom to improve the software so you

119
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,949
and anyone else so you can also contract

120
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,198
someone can make modifications on the

121
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:56,690
software for the better or for the worse

122
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:00,680
it doesn't matter and you can share

123
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:04,039
these improvements with everyone else so

124
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,930
that means that that's innovation at a

125
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,630
core because you don't have to reinvent

126
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:11,690
the wheel you can take work from other

127
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,940
people modify it improve it

128
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:18,080
use the freedoms and then give it back

129
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:20,569
to the community any software that is

130
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,628
restricting at least one of those four

131
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:26,690
freedoms is not free software it is

132
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:28,610
proprietary or non free software that's

133
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,699
important so all those four freedoms are

134
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,469
embedded in free software also important

135
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,240
to know is that some people use

136
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:37,430
different terms for free software so

137
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,009
some people say more open-source false

138
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,300
floss Libre software there are many

139
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:43,879
words for that but don't be confused

140
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,800
about the terminology I'm using here

141
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:47,629
free software but open source

142
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,759
essentially is the same it's just

143
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:55,479
another term for free software so let's

144
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:59,149
get to the topic what is IT security

145
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:01,219
well there are many many things about it

146
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:02,060
but first of all does anyone know who

147
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:06,590
this person on

148
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:09,110
on the pictures hands up oh only a few

149
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:12,219
hands interesting okay well this is

150
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,350
Bruce Schneier who Schneider is a quite

151
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:17,770
well-known security researcher

152
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:21,850
journalist and he wrote many books and

153
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:23,510
in one of his early books from 2000

154
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:27,260
secret and lies

155
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:30,380
he says security is not a product itself

156
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:33,020
is a process and it's a small sentence

157
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:38,980
but I find it so important because it

158
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:41,210
boils it down to the very core so often

159
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:44,740
marketing tells you that this and that

160
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:49,130
product doesn't that project is secure

161
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,570
but in fact how can they be sure it's

162
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,490
not a product it's not something that

163
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,349
you put in the shelf and say well now

164
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,810
it's secure and it will be secure

165
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,230
forever security is an ongoing thing and

166
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:02,330
it includes so many other things that

167
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:04,730
you cannot just say this is secure this

168
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,200
is not secure it contains so many other

169
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,980
factors that you have to take into

170
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:12,680
consideration now we're going to have a

171
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:15,080
look at how these processes could look

172
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:20,290
like so what are the factors that are

173
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:22,849
important for IT security now there are

174
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,710
different things for example there's the

175
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,030
more obvious things that if you ask

176
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,750
people on the street brothers IT

177
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,239
security

178
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:34,159
most of them could mention a few of

179
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:37,280
those code flaws so you anyone else as a

180
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,199
developer makes a mistake users makes a

181
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,270
logical mistake and therefore you have a

182
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,750
security flaw in Europe in your software

183
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:46,810
that happens that's quite obvious

184
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:50,540
encryption as well you use a an

185
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:53,150
algorithm a method which is not secure

186
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:56,750
anymore which has been proven to be

187
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:59,560
insecure that does not that harms your

188
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:03,710
security or the security of the users

189
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:06,380
but on the next step if you find those

190
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:09,050
bugs if you find those mistakes who is

191
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,960
taking care of fixing them their

192
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,760
original developer the user the company

193
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:17,400
who just put it in their own product

194
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,590
then we're thinking about other parts of

195
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,930
IT security which are not completely

196
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:24,560
related to code but more about the

197
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:28,439
collaboration between people and uses

198
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,349
scenarios then at second glance if you

199
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,920
look at IT security there are other

200
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,900
things like libraries I don't mean those

201
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,020
buildings with the books in it but

202
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,360
external libraries external elements

203
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:45,930
that developers can put into their own

204
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:49,560
code so for example if you look at a

205
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,310
common website people just use external

206
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,250
stylesheets

207
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:55,349
or external javascript libraries to not

208
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:59,040
have to reinvent the wheel but based on

209
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:01,560
the work that's already out there but do

210
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,420
you as a website operator or software

211
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,839
developer have to take care about the

212
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,880
security of this library well that's

213
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,610
that's an open question you could but

214
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,470
you probably also think that this is an

215
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,150
secure product and you don't have to

216
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,000
take care of it but of course you cannot

217
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:23,579
be sure for sure then there's the human

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,280
factor think of a service by company and

219
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,800
they invest a lot of money into IT

220
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,540
security and the best programmers who

221
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,949
can who can make this code really well

222
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:36,719
and you research a lot but like by

223
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,420
social engineering just one of the

224
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,000
co-workers gives out the whole database

225
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:45,089
of users because they think it's someone

226
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,530
else and well whole security is blown so

227
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,000
you also have to think of the humans

228
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,360
behind and the humans in the whole

229
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,750
supply chain which can somehow have an

230
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,030
influence on security and of course also

231
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,040
customization again imagine here you

232
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:02,550
have a security you have a software

233
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,160
product and then comes the client and

234
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:07,410
said well I like to have your software

235
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,199
it's great but please make this

236
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,699
modification then I will buy it then

237
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,170
comes the second client and the third

238
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,210
client and also want to have

239
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:19,829
modifications now you don't only have

240
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:21,210
one software but three four so you also

241
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,760
have to take that into conservation

242
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,670
whether those modifications that you may

243
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,220
have an influence

244
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:31,089
on your on your software on your

245
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:34,050
security sorry and then come the nasty

246
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:37,390
details for example business strategy

247
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:40,180
there's one quite well-known router

248
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:45,189
manufacturer who supported and quite

249
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:47,829
insecure file-sharing standard for a

250
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:52,840
long time and the standard was known to

251
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:56,260
have at least bugs but probably also

252
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:58,660
security issues but the company decided

253
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,090
to support it because they did not want

254
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:04,990
to lose the customers who depend on this

255
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:08,320
file-sharing has standard so what's the

256
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,730
right decision here I mean if the

257
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,770
company really depends on those

258
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,630
customers you don't want to lose it so

259
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,449
what is your other product that no one

260
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,640
buys in the end so this is an antenna a

261
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,830
part of a process again not part of a

262
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,990
thinking process it has to take place if

263
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,300
you think about that T security also

264
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:28,120
port fragments like take your average

265
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,760
smartphone doesn't even receive receive

266
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,300
security updates anymore

267
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,830
most smartphones often based on Android

268
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:39,430
only offer two or three years security

269
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:42,040
updates as a company that might make

270
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:44,229
sense from the economic perspective but

271
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,020
well you as a user have to think about

272
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:49,600
that if you think about a t security and

273
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,600
of course a company as well it's quite

274
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,010
complicated and if everything goes wrong

275
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,690
and your software who's liable for it

276
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:01,720
can you press legal challenges on that

277
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:04,810
if if a developer made mistakes that's

278
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,850
also in question so you see this is the

279
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:10,060
whole picture of IT security and just a

280
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,740
small extract of it so security is much

281
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,880
more than just secure code and

282
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:18,850
encryption and on the even bigger

283
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:23,410
picture technology and therefore

284
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:27,120
security is everywhere in the 21st

285
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:30,160
century if you think about politics

286
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,240
technology has an influence on really

287
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,469
every single issue that is debated right

288
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,350
now

289
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:42,959
well think about military of course

290
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,000
cyber warfare is everywhere like that

291
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,790
that's a password but think about the

292
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,730
health factor sector digitalization the

293
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,800
health sector is the state or is anyone

294
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,319
else allowed to take all our electronic

295
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,109
health data records to improve our

296
00:13:55,319 --> 00:14:01,050
health or at least like the general the

297
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:05,069
general system think about Social

298
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:08,670
Security what do we do with it with the

299
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:12,029
data how much your own and how much you

300
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:14,670
get by by a job and how's digitalization

301
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:16,439
going on there or think about education

302
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,790
of course there's also a lot of

303
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:20,040
technology involved there

304
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:23,370
how do what do we teach our children in

305
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,930
schools which products and so on so

306
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,579
technology basically is everywhere and

307
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,378
therefore is also a tea security

308
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:32,069
everywhere but the interesting thing is

309
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:34,769
that so many people not only in politics

310
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:36,599
but also in the companies who should

311
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:39,689
know better don't understand that

312
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,910
technology is basically the ground for

313
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:43,800
everything in the 21st century because

314
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,719
we already see it right now what

315
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:50,008
influence technology has enough today

316
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:52,050
but what's in 10 20 30 50 years so we

317
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:54,360
should think about security and

318
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:59,479
technology now and we should have

319
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:02,730
started 30 40 years ago so how can we

320
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:06,870
improve security in technology which is

321
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:09,300
driving our daily lives my thesis is

322
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:12,569
that free software has a big positive

323
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:15,839
influence on this but why does it work

324
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:18,240
like on this picture you take a free

325
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,569
software license the GPL license or any

326
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:25,790
other license approved by OSI or the FSF

327
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:28,740
and automatically the software is secure

328
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:32,579
well obviously not it's it's a little

329
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:35,970
more complicated but there are certain

330
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:39,599
benefits that free software can give to

331
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:42,240
IT security and to Atty safety and this

332
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,319
is I think because free software itself

333
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:49,170
is a process as well it by itself if you

334
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:52,049
do it right brings a lot of

335
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:54,540
to processes into any organization

336
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:57,619
either if you're a single developer or

337
00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:00,899
like a multi-billion company or a state

338
00:15:57,619 --> 00:16:04,949
programming software so I would like to

339
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:07,369
present your few examples of rare thing

340
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:12,329
and where we are sure that they

341
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:14,669
influence positively security so first

342
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:19,079
of all free software means transparency

343
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:22,019
for everyone it allows for independent

344
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:24,329
security audits like you and anyone else

345
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:26,160
you can contract that can issue as

346
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:28,138
security audit on a free software

347
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,169
I think reese's trust because you do not

348
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:33,809
receive a black box anymore by someone

349
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:35,850
else but you can be rather sure that you

350
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:38,549
can inspect it and that you can audit it

351
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:41,160
and that if everything is fine that you

352
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:44,910
have a decent product so this increases

353
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,738
trust also internally like everyone also

354
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,108
working in a company working for a free

355
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:52,429
software project can have some more

356
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:56,369
trust into software and that's important

357
00:16:52,429 --> 00:17:00,089
but there's also some kind of I would

358
00:16:56,369 --> 00:17:02,100
say kind outside pressure I see this a

359
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:05,010
lot when speaking at conferences with

360
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,559
developers no matter from which which

361
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:11,189
size and I asked them why is your

362
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:13,079
software not free software and this

363
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:16,919
kicks off quite interesting debates

364
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:19,289
because many say how well you know free

365
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:22,130
software it's a nice thing but I cannot

366
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:26,039
do that for my product for my project

367
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:27,480
why not yeah well there are those it

368
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,100
would be embarrassing there are still

369
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,840
those parts in the software that I

370
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,019
shouldn't release it with you know that

371
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,689
that's not possible

372
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:39,149
seriously why do you even release your

373
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,760
software in the first place so if you

374
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:44,189
really do the free software path you

375
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,408
will take another look unless you're

376
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:49,559
really crazy I mean most people would do

377
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:52,380
and clean that mess up and then put it

378
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,779
online so this creates some pressure for

379
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,340
everyone who is part of it and which in

380
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:59,250
the end has positive effects for

381
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,320
everyone for yourself and the people who

382
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,040
could use software and the users and the

383
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,889
end

384
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:10,460
then more on the bigger scale there are

385
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:13,250
a lot of sharing synergies we see that a

386
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:16,100
lot when administrations for example

387
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:19,520
cities work together on software that

388
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:23,810
happens surprisingly often and that

389
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:26,389
that's a cool development those cities

390
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:29,480
who work together sometimes across

391
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:33,170
borders and continents on software bring

392
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:37,390
completely different points of view into

393
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:39,920
a common shared software project and

394
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,870
this is this is the the power of

395
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,360
community because they are not only

396
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,250
monolithic and only seeing a narrow way

397
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,959
but they're taking interest in a

398
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,480
software project having their own use

399
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,150
cases having their own perspectives and

400
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,980
contribute to the software and that is a

401
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,110
benefit for security as well because

402
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:00,020
well you think about other paths and

403
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:03,860
what could happen and you make things

404
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:06,200
differently and therefore can also have

405
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:09,649
a look closer look on security and a

406
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,900
more diverse look on security but yes

407
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,760
some might guess this can also have

408
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,390
start downsides and we will take a look

409
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:21,070
at those later and last but not least

410
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:24,530
independence this often happens when

411
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:27,320
there's a security incident of a product

412
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:29,680
and the company who is responsible for

413
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,689
the software takes a long time to

414
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:36,620
release the patch finally with free

415
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:39,410
software is the mitigation to solve this

416
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:42,979
security incident is known everyone

417
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:45,320
users and those who would ask a friend

418
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,870
to do that can patch the software

419
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,820
themselves because it's transparent it

420
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,679
gives you access to it gives you control

421
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,379
over the software that you're actually

422
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,720
running and to fix security issues on

423
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,660
your own and not be dependent on some

424
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,200
third party and if those incidents have

425
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:06,050
more than often well then free software

426
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,930
projects can be formed you can just say

427
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:10,639
well I pick up the work from now and do

428
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,810
it better than the company or the the

429
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,180
project and the commune

430
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:17,000
before this gives a lot of Independence

431
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:19,520
and a lot of yeah sooner geez that

432
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,500
people work together want to work

433
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,440
together because well they cannot lock

434
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,270
in their users they do not have the full

435
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:30,380
control over their users but well it's a

436
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:35,720
shared thing it's a community issue so

437
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:38,720
all of this results in the conclusion

438
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:41,650
that free software isn't necessary but

439
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:46,610
not sufficient component of IT security

440
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:50,750
so what do I mean by that well free

441
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:54,979
software is necessary because if you

442
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:57,170
take IT security IT safety seriously you

443
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,810
should make it free software it's

444
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:03,080
necessary if you want to have a m-- to

445
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:05,389
100% IT security it has to be free

446
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,460
software because of the open processes

447
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,280
that free software give you and does

448
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,800
only free software can give you but it's

449
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,870
not sufficient only making it free

450
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,120
software and creating a nice friendly

451
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,699
community that's not enough for IT

452
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,370
security of course the call code also

453
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:25,040
has to be well written and reviewed and

454
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:27,610
there are so many other parts of the

455
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:30,139
process that we have two slides before

456
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:33,409
so those also have to be taken into

457
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:36,140
consideration so again free software is

458
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:43,460
necessary but not sufficient but it's a

459
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:45,290
big part of IT security now if you go

460
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,090
now the free software path with a

461
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:49,940
software project no matter at which

462
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:52,730
scale as an individual developer or as a

463
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,760
big company or public administration

464
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:58,820
there are some considerations to make

465
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:00,590
first of all responsibilities so if you

466
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:03,290
work together in a community who is

467
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:06,949
responsible for the security of the

468
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:09,230
project and who cares about the security

469
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,990
of external dependencies that you take

470
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:13,550
into your project of some libraries you

471
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,320
have to think about it it's not

472
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:19,280
unsolvable but of course it's an issue

473
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:22,370
and it's a challenge then the decree of

474
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,990
reuse free software is create because we

475
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,889
do not have to reinvent the wheel all

476
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:28,650
the time

477
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:30,960
we can if you take an average rep

478
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,000
application you can take the database

479
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,280
from there and the rep server from there

480
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,980
to serve operating system from somewhere

481
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,710
else and put your own 10 or 20 percent

482
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:43,440
code on top of it and it works and you

483
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:45,720
can ship that that's great it saves you

484
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,170
a lot of time and you can rely on the

485
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,690
competence of other people but on the

486
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:53,520
other hand then this creates a lot of

487
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,080
external dependencies you cannot check

488
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,020
the security of your own product and

489
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,990
those of the databases the reps are so

490
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,070
you cannot do that so this is a risk on

491
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,420
the other hand you could say well I

492
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:07,169
write everything on my own

493
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:09,230
only tailored towards my needs and I

494
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:12,810
know what's inside of the software and

495
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:15,000
that's fine but then this again puts a

496
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,560
lot of responsibility to you so you have

497
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,780
to write everything on your own

498
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,570
so this is a consideration to make that

499
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:23,610
many projects are many people who want

500
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:25,950
to make free software and who do it on

501
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:28,620
their daily basis have to do all the

502
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:31,200
time and this also has an influence on

503
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:34,110
security of course because well it

504
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,390
depends on which path you take then

505
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:38,459
there is this consideration of national

506
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,840
security that's really nice if you speak

507
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,140
to people from politics and they say

508
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,179
well free software that's great but we

509
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,500
cannot make our projects free software

510
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,040
because it would harm our national

511
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,070
security

512
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:52,980
I mean the code in there that's that's

513
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:54,330
our secret of secrecy and it would harm

514
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,330
us it would harm the government if

515
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:59,300
everyone would know how things go within

516
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:02,850
the state

517
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:07,530
yeah well that's that's always an

518
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:09,209
interesting discussion but it's the the

519
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:12,420
core of the questions quite interesting

520
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:15,840
is their software that house believes

521
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:18,810
would be disadvantageous for the society

522
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,610
and I would say well they might there

523
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:23,070
might be a few edge cases where this is

524
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:25,439
actually the case think about any

525
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:29,129
military sector should the software

526
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,980
running drones and exploding bombs be

527
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,960
public

528
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:36,909
and not for sure about that but that's a

529
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:41,230
consideration to take but the essence is

530
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:43,299
that I guess for 99.9 percent of the

531
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,760
software this does not apply it doesn't

532
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:48,100
harm the national security and we will

533
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,700
come back to that later when speaking

534
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:54,100
about critical infrastructure and of

535
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:57,549
course again there are other components

536
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,980
of security so think about free Hardware

537
00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:02,470
what is rather perfectly fine secure

538
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,860
free software if the chips underneath

539
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:07,779
our containing backdoors you think about

540
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,459
reproducible builds that's a great thing

541
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:11,370
that you can prove that the binaries

542
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,389
that the output of the program actually

543
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:16,209
matches the source code that has been

544
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:19,000
audited ideally and of course all those

545
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:21,309
other processes and parts of security

546
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,360
and then there are those common

547
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:25,570
counter-arguments that you have to face

548
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,189
again

549
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,980
often happens when you talk to people

550
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,299
from public administrations well free

551
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,510
software is great but only for

552
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:38,200
non-critical things the exact opposite

553
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:40,210
is the case if you think about critical

554
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,399
infrastructure public infrastructure

555
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:45,480
things that our daily lives are based

556
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:49,510
upon it has to be open and transparent

557
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:51,309
so because we as a society want to trust

558
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,139
in those systems we want to have trust

559
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:55,658
on the roads that we drive our cars on

560
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:59,039
but we also want to have trust in the

561
00:25:55,659 --> 00:26:02,289
software that stores our health records

562
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,389
so the more critical the more public it

563
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:06,039
becomes the more important is that the

564
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:09,158
processes behind it are open and

565
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:13,990
transparent and also with the interest

566
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:16,600
for our security then also public code

567
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:19,570
means risk that's that's also quite nice

568
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:23,230
and often hurt but of course definitely

569
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:25,928
wrong the principle of security by

570
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:29,409
obscurity has been proven wrong for so

571
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:33,760
many times source code can often be

572
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:36,549
reconstructed even from binaries and I

573
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,899
mean also attacks on pure black boxes

574
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:39,940
where attackers don't know anything

575
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:40,780
about the system behind it often more

576
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,480
successful

577
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:45,940
so instead of investing time on keeping

578
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,950
a source code secret we should invest

579
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,200
time and resources to make the software

580
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:52,870
actually secure and free software has

581
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,000
the potential to get more people on

582
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,709
board to make a software secure so we

583
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,040
should the black Perkins principle was

584
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:04,690
said he said that to to encryption

585
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:09,129
mechanisms or algorithms that the the

586
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:11,950
method to keep something secret or to

587
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:14,560
make something encrypted has to be open

588
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:18,160
but of course the secret itself the data

589
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,679
should always be kept secret and kept

590
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,020
hidden and kept secure so we should

591
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,480
separate that and making a software free

592
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:28,750
software doesn't mean that the data and

593
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,450
the sensible privacy related data has to

594
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:34,360
be open and interestingly still don't

595
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:36,520
many actors in like from those other

596
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:40,179
worlds that we speak with still don't

597
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:42,879
understand them then often heard is that

598
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:45,190
free software is only done by and for

599
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,350
hobbyists and therefore they do not have

600
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:49,780
the resources to make it secure that's

601
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:53,649
also wrong if you take a look at the

602
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:56,320
Linux kernel it's the majority of

603
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:59,680
contributors of code contributors are

604
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,450
from big IT corporations which hopefully

605
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,300
do understand something about Atty

606
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:08,770
security look at companies like Red Hat

607
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:11,230
or foundations like Apache Mozilla or

608
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:13,300
even companies like Microsoft ourself to

609
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,830
now embrace free software and say well

610
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,470
that's the basis for our future cloud

611
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:19,260
business so well there must be something

612
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,610
about it or if you look at

613
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,440
virtualization and the sector where

614
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:26,379
almost everything is free software or

615
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,870
custom content management systems the

616
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:31,960
majority of our websites is based on

617
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:35,020
free software and there's the argument

618
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,690
of business secrets that if you speak to

619
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:40,750
owners of companies whom you tell about

620
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:43,360
free software say well yes it's great

621
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:46,090
but I cannot open up the corner of my

622
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,209
software because well it would directly

623
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:51,809
harm my business and to be honest I can

624
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:55,269
sometimes in some cases understand that

625
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:57,250
imagine a company having as a solution

626
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:59,980
the code solution for one pressing issue

627
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:02,019
and they have their really superior in

628
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,419
their solution so opening up the code

629
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:07,179
the mechanism the method to soften a

630
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:09,789
specific issue with source code which

631
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:11,980
harm their business of yesterday so

632
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:14,649
these are the few edge cases but the

633
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:18,899
majority of all businesses and business

634
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:22,779
models is compatible with free software

635
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:27,549
so this is sometimes the reddit argument

636
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:32,769
but in most cases not so to apply this

637
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:36,039
to reality now I would like to make an

638
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:38,740
example or speak about an example namely

639
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:42,519
Huawei has popped up in the February

640
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:45,130
this year where la way a Chinese company

641
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:50,049
which produces mass phones but is also a

642
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:54,100
leading in 5g network equipment so the

643
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:56,559
next generation mobile internet standard

644
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:59,830
they have been accused by the US

645
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,840
government that they are spying on their

646
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:04,480
users that the Chinese government or

647
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,189
Huawei themselves implement backdoors in

648
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,809
the network equivalent of 5g

649
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:12,100
infrastructure and other equipment and

650
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:16,059
that was quite an interesting debate

651
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:18,668
because finally on a large scale people

652
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:21,700
talked about trust issues in critical

653
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:24,850
infrastructure and I can understand them

654
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:28,299
not because Huawei is a Chinese company

655
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:31,269
I also wouldn't trust US companies or

656
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:34,299
Swedish companies but it's a general

657
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:36,970
mistake we're taking or we are basing

658
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:40,059
our daily communication and also in the

659
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:42,789
future perhaps a lot of industry things

660
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:47,408
and public infrastructure on top of

661
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:49,269
black boxes so we at the effort if you

662
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:52,570
thought about how we could solve this

663
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:54,039
puzzle and it turned out that free

664
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:56,260
software could be a really viable

665
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:59,399
solution to solve these trust issues

666
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:02,000
inside of critical infrastructure

667
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:05,899
because free software for

668
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,780
trust you can trust in a in a free

669
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:11,090
software you can trust in a system that

670
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:13,250
has free software in it because it's

671
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:18,260
transparent and because it has those

672
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:21,650
those yet solve this this riddle of of

673
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:25,190
trust you can make independent security

674
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:27,620
audits like not you yourself but also

675
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:30,770
agencies companies you can hire people

676
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:33,409
to do that and those agencies those

677
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:37,790
national agencies who usually check the

678
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:40,340
security of this kind of critical

679
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:42,649
network equipment can share their work

680
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,260
because their budget if you look at

681
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:48,440
agencies in Germany Austria of Serbia

682
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:52,640
probably as well it's much smaller than

683
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:55,280
the budget of huawei for example so but

684
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,960
with free software if the code of such a

685
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,440
critical infrastructure would be free

686
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:04,100
software they could share the work and

687
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:06,010
distribute those security checks another

688
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,560
quite interesting thought is that

689
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:12,470
competition adds another pressure and

690
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:15,560
additional pressure on those companies

691
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:19,100
giving this or creating this critical

692
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:21,710
infrastructure because how nice would it

693
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:27,080
be for huawei to find the backdoor

694
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:29,210
inside of cisco equipment yeah that

695
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:33,439
would be quite nice right then agencies

696
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:37,490
can also turn down a little bit and let

697
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:41,960
them other this but again it's also

698
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:44,990
important that reproducibility is given

699
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:48,530
and that free hardware is available so

700
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:52,520
again what's the best secure most free

701
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:54,710
free software if the chips are on the

702
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,400
bottom of the software are containing

703
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,560
backdoors

704
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:02,060
so this is another factor that we have

705
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:04,419
to take into consideration now you would

706
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:06,889
think that's completely unrealistic

707
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:12,110
Huawei would never open up their source

708
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:14,000
code and well I can say well I think as

709
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:15,990
well I think so too I think we are too

710
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,100
late now for huawei specific

711
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:22,530
but Huawei kicked off or this case

712
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,969
Huawei kicked off a debate inside of

713
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:26,280
ministries and and public

714
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:29,070
administrations and politics about how

715
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:33,178
we can trust our critical infrastructure

716
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:34,860
and interestingly when we summarize

717
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:37,860
those ideas and made a press statement

718
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:40,408
in February this year it has been picked

719
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,990
up surprisingly often and we have been

720
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:45,990
invited to a few meetings also in a

721
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:48,750
German ministry to present those ideas

722
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:51,059
and to discuss it because they see those

723
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:54,510
issue issues as well not everyone but a

724
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:58,020
few so it starts it starts that we think

725
00:33:54,510 --> 00:34:00,150
as a society we start to think about how

726
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:02,400
we can control the technology that

727
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:06,559
drives our communication and our daily

728
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:09,179
lives so I think that in the long term

729
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:13,199
we will see a lot of more discussions of

730
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:15,470
those kinds and hopefully evaluate free

731
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,060
software to be one of the solutions to

732
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:23,759
have more trust in public infrastructure

733
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:25,589
and to increase the IT security so what

734
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,760
I would like to ask you to do is two

735
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:32,339
things first of all if the next security

736
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,339
incidents happens and it will surely

737
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:39,119
happen if you reach broadly then please

738
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:41,790
think about whether free software could

739
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,690
have at least mitigated parts of this

740
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:48,060
issue think about whether a state

741
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:52,560
infrastructure or the next hospital

742
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:54,899
which got miraculously hacked by some

743
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,759
trillions whatever think about it

744
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:59,250
whether software free software could

745
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,150
have had a positive effect on that and

746
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:05,280
could have solved that and second of all

747
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:06,960
please give us feedback if you think

748
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,970
that some of those arguments that are

749
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,160
just presented are wrong or that we

750
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:14,879
should focus on other arguments please

751
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:16,440
let me know even I like after the talk

752
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,599
or write me an email that would be

753
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,369
really nice because we really urgent Lee

754
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:23,130
you have to think about how to solve

755
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:25,230
those issues because yes technology is

756
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:27,609
everywhere and we have to think about IT

757
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:32,650
security and if we don't do it

758
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:35,619
probably no one will so thank you for

759
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:37,420
your attention and at this note also

760
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:41,549
thanks to all the FSB supporters who

761
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:41,549
support our work thank you very much

762
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,620
[Applause]

763
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:59,589
[Music]

764
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,070
[Music]

765
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,829
[Music]

766
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,990
[Laughter]

767
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:56,329
[Music]

768
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:49,700
so yeah finally I have to correct each

769
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,290
shot for that right now so this is an

770
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,689
initiative topic many public code that

771
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:56,359
we are running since two years it's

772
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:57,800
directly aimed at this issue like there

773
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:00,200
are big corporations and they're also

774
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,140
like not only corporations but also like

775
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,089
politicians who do not want to have free

776
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:07,279
software because I do not understand

777
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:09,320
free software probably most probably so

778
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,970
for example Amsterdam is a good example

779
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,950
because they are pushing forward to that

780
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:16,100
but a really good example is Barcelona

781
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:19,189
for example they noticed that they are

782
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:22,069
dependent on proprietary software on

783
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:24,710
external contractors and that they're

784
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:29,660
really kept imprisoned by them basically

785
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:32,240
so they started an initiative a few

786
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:34,580
years ago and it's in a really good

787
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,750
shape because they set up policies how

788
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:42,380
to make tenders for free software so

789
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:44,510
this happens with a few steps so first

790
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:47,210
of all they say well 70% of the IT

791
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:49,520
budget that we are spending has to go

792
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:51,800
especially for creating new software not

793
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,130
only buying new stuff about creating has

794
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,360
to be

795
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:56,510
spend for free and open source software

796
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,970
so they set a set of licenses that are

797
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:03,070
required and it's put in the contracts

798
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:06,859
that's the first good step but they also

799
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:10,760
included local economy in this process

800
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:12,940
they said well we have to enable smaller

801
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:16,970
and medium-sized companies to

802
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:19,550
participate in those tenders because if

803
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:21,529
you look at tenders for example on au

804
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,690
level it's so complicated and there are

805
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:27,290
so many requirements that only big

806
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:29,030
corporations can ever make but free and

807
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,800
open-source software I think is it's

808
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:33,170
really strong in small and medium sized

809
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,950
enterprises and their art has its roots

810
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:38,770
so they enabled or they lower the

811
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:41,569
requirements I made it possible for

812
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:43,640
smaller companies for local companies to

813
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:45,890
participate in tenders so that was

814
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,319
another good step and they did not only

815
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:53,600
speak about it and made abstract laws

816
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:58,310
but put policies in place so policies

817
00:39:53,600 --> 00:40:00,920
for public servants to open tenders for

818
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:02,390
free software so that they understand on

819
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,370
the ground to do the actual work

820
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:06,740
whatwhy free software is important in

821
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:09,020
how to cook your free software because

822
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:11,149
we see that for example Italy there's

823
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:14,500
they have I don't know how many years

824
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:17,150
ago they implemented a law or they

825
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,160
published the law which basically is

826
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:22,880
public money public code they say well

827
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:24,920
all software funded by the state by the

828
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,130
government by the public has to be free

829
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,160
software what happened unfortunately not

830
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:34,310
much they are currently in the good

831
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:36,200
implementation process but they also had

832
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:40,340
to learn that just writing laws is not

833
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:42,710
enough you have to convince the the

834
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:45,200
middle and the lower crowns about the

835
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:48,050
benefits of free software as well so

836
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,759
it's a long path and we're at the FS of

837
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:51,770
VR providing resources for that for

838
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,210
example you look by come by the booth

839
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:55,910
that that I have over there

840
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:58,000
we created a brochure summarizing free

841
00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:01,118
software the benefits

842
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,369
in their language because right now or

843
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,560
before that if you researched as a

844
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:08,730
public servant as a politician who those

845
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:11,109
doesn't know much about technology

846
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:13,119
you didn't really find resources that

847
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:15,549
explain it to you and and give you good

848
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,070
examples for that so we compiled that

849
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:21,670
and this enables also other people not

850
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:24,910
only us at the fsfe but also other NGOs

851
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:26,440
other individual individuals activists

852
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:28,629
on the ground and smaller and

853
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,910
medium-sized cities to get active as

854
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:35,740
well so what we need really is to think

855
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:37,569
about the strategy how we can how we can

856
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:40,569
make it decentralized so not only

857
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:42,580
convince one state and then say we will

858
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:46,300
create and then the government changes

859
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:49,630
and everything is destroyed again every

860
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,520
effort but to to start on the lower

861
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:54,670
ground and another strategy that we

862
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:58,990
learned if I may say is that we do not

863
00:41:54,670 --> 00:42:02,099
start for example in cities with moving

864
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:04,779
to for example Linux based desktops

865
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:06,670
where then all the applications that

866
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,920
existed are not running any more on

867
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:10,810
those desktops and then you have to

868
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,730
start to referring up the desktops and

869
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:14,170
then everyone complains so what we

870
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:16,660
should rather do is concentrate on

871
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:19,990
software at first that is newly created

872
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:21,848
on this application level that and this

873
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:24,000
happens quite often like I mean it

874
00:42:21,849 --> 00:42:27,160
starts from with the easy things like a

875
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,290
small town wants to create a tourist app

876
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,720
like the tourist can download and with

877
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:35,200
some coupons and whatever some benefits

878
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:37,598
and so often this is proprietary

879
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,450
software and extremely expensive so

880
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,790
every small town in a touristic region

881
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:44,560
needs such an app or may need such an

882
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:47,020
app so that's what would be a great

883
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,900
example for a free software thing so if

884
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:53,830
we start in the small steps we can in

885
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:55,480
the end be in a position where we can

886
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:59,049
basically switch the operating without

887
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:02,109
anyone noticing so that was also turn of

888
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:05,589
strategy but I completely agree it's

889
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:07,569
it's a long way definitely and so we

890
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:09,630
have to take into consideration so many

891
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:11,610
different aspects of research

892
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:16,110
so not only saying well it's cheaper and

893
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:17,730
that's only the case and long term but

894
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,740
also like that the general things that

895
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:22,230
we as a public pay for the software so

896
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:24,509
we should own it or also the security

897
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:26,190
things so that's what I'm what I was

898
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:27,960
doing today it's saying well if you want

899
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:30,930
to have secure software make it free

900
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:34,940
software write it in your tenders I hope

901
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:34,940
that long thing answered your question

902
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:57,330
not directly no so many companies like

903
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:00,750
what we do especially free software

904
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:02,790
companies because well they might get

905
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:05,130
into a better at a position of that but

906
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:06,450
we do not have direct cooperation with

907
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:08,790
them because we also want to stay

908
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:10,410
independent and do not want to be seen

909
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:12,450
as a lobbying organization just for

910
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:15,359
those few free software organizations

911
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:18,569
free software companies so ideally also

912
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:20,430
now proprietary companies could also

913
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:22,530
create free software why not you don't

914
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:25,200
have to be a free software company to to

915
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:27,840
write free software so it also well be

916
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,790
that if in a tender for example there's

917
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,370
a requirement to make it just a free

918
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:34,350
software product in the end that could

919
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:38,180
also easily publish that and create that

920
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:38,180
so that would be possible why not

921
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:51,840
other feedback and questions it doesn't

922
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,950
see so so please come by the booth and

923
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:58,620
talk with me and give me personal

924
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:58,620
feedback or by email thank you very much

925
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,730
you
