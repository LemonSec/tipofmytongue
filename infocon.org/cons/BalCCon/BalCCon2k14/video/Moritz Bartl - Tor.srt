1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,420
that

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,030
the

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:21,020
well West

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:28,020
air whatever care to hide

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,870
say um and some weird way

6
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,430
I this is part of the material that some

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,910
plans are but Snowden came to light solo
on

8
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:46,160
it is not known if it's just a certain
Department of the NSA or

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,449
like this summer intern who wrote some
slides or

10
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:53,489
if it's like the it represents the whole
state of knowledge by the NSA

11
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,559
about four um so

12
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,940
a in in this presentation that was shown

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:06,789
I am the AA they they said it will never
be able to be unwise also use this

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,880
all the time I'm but that they can

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,630
with manual analysis the anonymous a
small question of Toyota's

16
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,750
and I will come back to that later when
we look at some other problems for the

17
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,640
technology

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,180
solve the issues and maybe how to
address them

19
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,280
I'm and and and

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,710
what what is likely the way they're
doing on minimizing

21
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,470
currently up this is a separate

22
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,700
a said so a home besides the world's
also released

23
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,950
um and this is this is the kind of a
nice testimonials to say

24
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,470
other tower is the king of my secure
low-latency and another on a meaty

25
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,330
and there are no contenders for the
phone waiting I'm

26
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,960
the sort of reflects also my thinking
when people

27
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,630
say oh I have heard store hours this and
that flaw and

28
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,798
these and other problems is that that
might be

29
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,450
the truth but there's no alternative to
its I'm

30
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,920
and when the money comes to anonymity
online um

31
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,339
at these for all I'm Sol

32
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,780
first of all of the a biggest problems
the

33
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,129
I have when when when I talk to
journalists are

34
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:24,518
or even ordinary people they
misunderstand the term

35
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,510
anonymous communication in the context
of tort

36
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,099
anonymous communication is not up about
communication where you

37
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,750
trying to be anonymous that's what I it
what I called in this life anonymous

38
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,390
speech

39
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,869
I so it's not about some like shuttle
that's

40
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,120
kind of thing where you meets a random

41
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,730
anonymous stranger because even
anonymous is a very awkward

42
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,189
if you're talking to someone on line did
you meet them regularly if you don't

43
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:53,138
know the name you don't know much about
the

44
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,590
entity usually have a persistent
identifiers of that person

45
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,659
and that's pseudonymous soul

46
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:03,328
II guess there is very little a

47
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:07,879
interests and in communication that is
really anonymous in that sense that

48
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,899
you're talking

49
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,010
that you don't have any persistent
identifiers for the person you're

50
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,659
talking to

51
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,730
um but even then

52
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,298
Tori isn't really about that I so to
resolve

53
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,609
to people want to communicate yeah in
this life can be very wonderful

54
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:25,480
visualizations I made it myself

55
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,700
a

56
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,250
I'm and and these people that they know
each other

57
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,269
or its a website that you know and
you're willing to offer to identify to

58
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:35,870
that website it doesn't matter

59
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,709
so at one 11 example would be

60
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:44,260
you want access to Facebook and Facebook
you your with your real name on facebook

61
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,890
and you all your friends on Facebook and

62
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,950
and he's still want to reach the web
site anonymously

63
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,708
I so or is about protecting the late

64
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,160
the communication path between
communication partners.

65
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,190
it's about a making sure that from the
outside

66
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,280
it's very hard to see who is
communicating with whom

67
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,390
and when they're communicating so

68
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,779
and the in the first half of today and
been talked about

69
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,070
post on some trips all and and hello how
you know how we can

70
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,418
secure communication link but still

71
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:26,450
by up by just by being able to see
traffic flowing between communication

72
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,010
hartness and we had a lot of a news
about the

73
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,900
meter data correlation and nurses
network analysis

74
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,400
up people the I mean if you can

75
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,099
you can probably imagine that there's a
lot of stuff

76
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,310
you can derive just from knowing he was
talking to me

77
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,450
fall on their talking and when they're
talking any such a setup

78
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,840
and and that isn't addressed by

79
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,688
by

80
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:55,949
some by any photography on

81
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:00,049
that is what war is about torrez about
additional

82
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,318
Lee to securing the communication

83
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:07,269
by end-to-end encryption you also want
to make sure that nobody sees the

84
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:10,110
connection in the first place between
communication partners.

85
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,489
I'm I like this site because

86
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:16,589
I'll well as about human rights and the
like human rights

87
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:20,699
I'm and and I i

88
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,179
a especially like the wordy and

89
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:27,609
army I want to little always when

90
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,499
especially when I talk to journalists
and a confront me with the

91
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:35,759
negative if that's all securing
communication making sure that all the

92
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,479
others can

93
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,399
10 sort of money to or we are
communicating with and miss high price

94
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,009
of

95
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:44,069
that it's clearly stated here that

96
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:48,459
human rights is to seek receive and
impart information and ideas

97
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:52,309
to any media and regardless of frontiers
and

98
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:56,039
this i think is the main thing that or
is about and

99
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,659
and I I wanted to lose it so usually I
i'm too

100
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,580
article twenty up because I believe in
anything

101
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,840
in the thats when your meeting online
and communicating online

102
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,289
it's really about the right assembly and
association

103
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,979
I am so I think that's also very
important human rights

104
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:20,150
but we we don't we'll have to give up
when we enter

105
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,870
the digital world I so

106
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,069
um just

107
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:30,699
as a reminder for most if you like this
post if you have heard about or

108
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,699
unlike the dinner consulate some you may
not sell

109
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:38,690
the idea is that you have a notice he
would call that the clouds

110
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,219
so this is at war clouds this is a so
the

111
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:47,180
network love torn olds a as they're
called in the side

112
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,389
um thats providing

113
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:55,039
a infrastructure that heat or user can
use

114
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,139
to reroute their communications across
the internet so it's an overlay network

115
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:03,969
over the Internet and the tower climb
the tower user

116
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:07,229
son s 2010 this 10 the sets of

117
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:10,840
ultra-religious a which is called the
Enfield

118
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,888
and then makes a certain makes another
connection to the middle lol

119
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,229
and then to the external than the exit
notes actually executed

120
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,479
the requests and for what's the answer

121
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,680
I back to the back to the user

122
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,839
um and as you can see if there is a

123
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,009
you cannot see any better clearly here
bus obviously there's a person between

124
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:34,759
these

125
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,810
and there's a you not very good

126
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,240
visualizations that was one of the few
earliest visualizations

127
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,520
of the concept behind for which is
called long and all 10

128
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,539
which is that you as a client

129
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:52,360
you know you know all public keys all
the participating relays

130
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,490
so you can you can set up what they all
the all the calls

131
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,550
telescope tell us the whole to the axes

132
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,620
read a so you include the traffic that
you want to send the data

133
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,620
um with but was was

134
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,840
color blue year up and only the exit we
like in the practice

135
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,909
and the new that again with the key from
the Middle relay

136
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,330
and then you put it again for the
entryway so if you take the telescope

137
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,580
and turned 90 degrees you can see it's

138
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,700
it's like shells rounds the the real
traffic

139
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,000
so this is what what what is on in is
about so it's like on the in

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,390
I'm gauntlets like an onion %uh

141
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,280
around the traffic and and that makes it
possible so

142
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,699
and yet we know you receive a connection
from some

143
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,750
and use you know who you're talking to
so you see the IP address

144
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,390
over user but you don't know all the
content of

145
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,250
a.m. all the data and you don't see

146
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,260
the destination address you don't see
the exit

147
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,800
address all you see is when you rule
your

148
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,209
and clergy lay a at the entry read a
UCAR

149
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,700
the address of the middle of the day and
the traffic going to happen to the

150
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,350
middle of the day

151
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,680
um so the new house the traffic to the
middle relay

152
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,050
and they've removed there are layer of
encryption and then pass it on to the

153
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,760
exit lane

154
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,480
and then the exit relay um

155
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,530
so the late in the day sees only put the
content right

156
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,689
they see a connection coming from some
relay I'm

157
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,510
they see but they have to poll what it
to another relay

158
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,510
but it's all in fact that with the with
that said we lay

159
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,680
key um so they can really see

160
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,939
they they don't see the user side and
they don't don't see the destination

161
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,810
other content

162
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,319
and the accident today um they see the
initial

163
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,020
past because that's what you once the
actual relate to see because they will

164
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,660
executed on your behalf

165
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,810
and

166
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,000
and make the requests for sent your data
to some destination

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,960
and get the return um content and I will
come back to that because

168
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,500
because thats I mean that's one of the
things that people always confront

169
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,839
front for people with this that the exit
related

170
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,279
can see the original content that the
usual

171
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,810
Wilson I

172
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,380
to the practical part I'm what you have
to do when you want to use tor

173
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,520
is you um you just fire up the Toros a
bottle

174
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,510
you can download it from the website
this is a nice Windows been shot

175
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:36,170
'em it works cross-platform so there's a
there's a Linux bill

176
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,290
there's a I'm when those bills

177
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,910
and lot built and you can build it on
your own

178
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,279
obscure platform shown to I'll

179
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,400
him I'll there's there's no reason for
Android

180
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,470
the though its call or both um

181
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,839
and yes um

182
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,880
soul what happens when you fire up the
torch browser it's a modified Firefox

183
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,490
because

184
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,690
up today all one of the problems that
you have on top of

185
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,110
um Heidi the communication path

186
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,540
is that usually your applications that
you want to use

187
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,310
they also and that a lot of or make it
possible to

188
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,709
access a lot of information from your
local that from that you don't want to

189
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,200
leak

190
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,480
for example the screen size or up to all
sorts of fingerprinting

191
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,860
there's a nice website open up to click
from the if

192
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,700
where you can way with a show you what
kind of attributes

193
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,520
they can get from your local machine via
javascript and some other methods

194
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,750
up to to finger printing machine so even
across sessions

195
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,970
I no matter where you're coming from
they can

196
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,300
they can I re identify you subtract you
across sessions

197
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,030
and so

198
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,400
one point a tor decided that they
because one of the main applications of

199
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,010
Tor

200
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:00,280
is obviously the housing they had to
provide its even more application level

201
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,030
support

202
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,410
a to protect against this ranking
methods a

203
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,990
saw at the beginning um we we

204
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,610
a tried to do it by the by an extension
so we will just

205
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,610
insolvent or Publix tension in your
browser

206
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,550
and then switched all the told and

207
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,209
it turned out that there's a lot of
fingerprinting methods that you can't

208
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,700
really access as an extension that you
would have to label would want to

209
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,480
disable

210
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,710
a so we're actively working with us a
lot to all push

211
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,410
all the changes we made into of some
kind of interface

212
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,089
so we can enable its the there's even
the process of

213
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,100
of integrating tore completely in
Firefox

214
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,760
they're very interested and and and have
a like a better

215
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,270
private law because the current private
more doesn't really protects

216
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:52,730
what the user expects to protect I

217
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,490
so the current state is that it's not
exactly a for

218
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,660
it's a set of patches that are applied
to the fire forceful

219
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,390
base and where using the extended the

220
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,819
Service Release so we're not using that
over

221
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,260
you lose in five spitz over missiles
that's all that week

222
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,160
a bus they have an extended service
released mentor

223
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,010
I'm large companies that have to
redeploy and

224
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,450
depending on on still more stable base
soul

225
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,140
they do backport the security fixes but
they don't

226
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,319
come with the latests features that

227
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,060
nobody really needs anyway and and then
we apply I think at the moment it's

228
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,349
around $40 purchase to the cove base to
further protect

229
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,390
users from fingerprinting and Tess own

230
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,430
and this is how it looks like you can
enter your destination address

231
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,620
and use it as an all-new Rosa and

232
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,170
the the second approach other the second
um

233
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,500
most popular use it or is to use tells

234
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,520
details the life distribution based on
Debian

235
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,550
and it comes pre-configured

236
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,420
saw any indication that comes with it it
with this traffic

237
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,510
through 24 and you can't start anything

238
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,800
and make the connections like

239
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,630
without or from your machine so protects
from

240
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,260
from all sorts of attacks the against

241
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,750
against like you running something that
the anonymous issue because

242
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,510
it runs on your local machine and it
doesn't do a store and makes an outgoing

243
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,810
connection to something

244
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,540
I and also like being alive distribution

245
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,689
you can put it on a read-only a medium
and then

246
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,990
an attacker cannot modify your local

247
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,180
your local system and obvious is again
since it's the

248
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,800
life distribution I'm it doesn't leave
traces on your machine

249
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,250
so you just alluded to do whatever and
and and it doesn't

250
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,080
affect any of your just sore whatever
you have in your machine

251
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,590
um

252
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,510
there's a lot of I'll interesting
material that I want to show you

253
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,240
below it thought would start with the
number of users from serving

254
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,270
there's a website of metrics that has a
lot of interesting statistics on both

255
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,449
the network size

256
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,650
and the user side and um

257
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,410
as you can see them number of
connections coming from serbia

258
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,910
this pretty stable a has been pretty
stable over the last month

259
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:35,870
I didn't go back in time because there
were some incidents affecting the

260
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,040
calculation the estimation a of

261
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,459
of users but um this is

262
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,710
what we have at the moment I'm

263
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,830
um

264
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,020
I then in the

265
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,329
even even I'm when I arrived and and and
and

266
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,370
in the course of today there was

267
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,860
like have really even like frequently
asked questions people coming up

268
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,550
and asking from mostly the same
questions about for

269
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,030
I soul II thoughts

270
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,050
to address these these comments I'm

271
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,060
so one of the things people always
repeat this

272
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,500
since you're making connections while
relays and anyone can speed up the relay

273
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,270
and

274
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,689
basically forwards traffic for other
people what happens

275
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,120
if I'm militias actor and I run real es

276
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,830
a so

277
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,370
there's a remember that there is

278
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,930
the like to the overview and related to
the network

279
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,150
and the Middle relay and I certainly
think so we have to look at all three

280
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,170
positions

281
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,959
for up the the problems with maliciously
lace

282
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,420
and so militias axes relay

283
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,069
I'll I already mentioned earlier this is
actually a

284
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,110
concede the user traffic and the
destination

285
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,140
us but not the source I P and

286
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,569
it can modify obviously it can modify
all the content

287
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:09,730
that it sees can modify the request
you're sending a little life I it then

288
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,180
the answer coming back um

289
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,800
the most important thing is our DNS
requests

290
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,020
that the industry for so you DP and
toward doesn't handle you TP

291
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,349
but for DNS there's subset of DNS
requests the

292
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:29,370
come most common DNS requests that or
forwards to the exits

293
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,540
and the exit is supposed to all to
execute the DNS requests and for what

294
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,350
the answer back and

295
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,990
so and it can modify the Indus

296
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,050
a answers on it can look at

297
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,470
it should be traffic modify the answer
and

298
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:51,310
take a look into SMTP I'm out the usual
layer protocols and all the other only

299
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,510
for the particles

300
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,890
there was some studies where people ran
its and money toward it

301
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,210
and and looked at the DataTables
following through and i think im still

302
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,630
um II don't know about any recent

303
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,960
studies like that because the its

304
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,610
it's problematic issue

305
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,689
if you look at its traffic for that form
other people

306
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,960
you you usually lose your legal
protection a

307
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,130
because you're not supposed to look at

308
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,530
use a traffic I'm and also ethically

309
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:29,200
um its its a dangerous tool to the

310
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,340
due to melt too many statistics and to
look into packets from

311
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,480
from other people but somehow it's I
would guess that there are still a lot

312
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,890
of plaintext traffic on the toilet paper

313
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,500
so this is a real problem and the the

314
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,110
there there is no good way for poor to
address this because its

315
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,909
the it's a user's responsibility up to
decide what kind of applications they

316
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,320
want a tunnel that or

317
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,320
um tales used to tell everything you run

318
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,280
on the tails operating system buy it for
they stop doing that

319
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,750
so no a when you fire up in the run-up
occasional

320
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,890
on tales it just fails I because

321
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,670
because you really want to have the sort
of

322
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,490
control over what kind of occasions and
can even

323
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,960
can even used for in the first place and
me

324
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,290
this is why I that ok browser comes with

325
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,800
extension like its EPS overran to make
sure that

326
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,290
at least for the web sites that are no
need to support its GPS

327
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,379
I you're making its the best 120

328
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,850
with the connections um

329
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:41,360
I'm I like certificate patrol its
notification that

330
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,310
on money tours the certificates overtime

331
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,889
so when you see a certificate change the
website

332
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,430
displays the change soul while

333
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,940
certificates expire at some point so the
levels

334
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,900
changes that are near to the expiration
date and only displays a small

335
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,050
information when no

336
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,210
I like a bar on top of the

337
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:08,650
the problem but if those changes in the
certificate authority or changes the

338
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:13,970
don't match with the expiration date you
gotta of the chills the changes in the

339
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,820
certificates and that's very helpful

340
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,460
I because even we think that the
connections

341
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,210
if if the exit relay is trying to
actively

342
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,570
on play will mess with your with your

343
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,939
data and you can you can still hopefully
detect that

344
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,390
and I mean that's a big problem for the
whole internet that

345
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,510
it's the best says basically I'll

346
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:43,080
know me to have its big problems for the
whole certificate authority

347
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,889
mmm my issues and

348
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,710
we also run scanners across the network

349
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,110
um so they run all the time constantly
looking

350
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,389
thats to apply in certain tests all

351
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,220
you can obviously you can't detect some
was sniffing the traffic but to

352
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,430
you're able to tool on hopefully find

353
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,590
a.m. realize that modify and it turns
out that

354
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,620
most at the relays that mess with use
the traffic that we fouled

355
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,989
and we're for example were configured to
use Open DNS

356
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,180
and Open DNS as a filter list and they
don't allow certain destinations so

357
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,190
that's one problem

358
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,760
and I'm a lot of times it turns out to
be a misconfigured system and you

359
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,810
rights to the relay operator and you
tell them about problem in the fixes

360
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,200
I'm there's a set so real estate up from
time to time that

361
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,140
%uh trying like primitive man in the
middle attacks that even the

362
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,630
tower also without certificate but all
up will show you

363
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,210
because the was so sensitive because I'm

364
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,400
but I mean most users will politely just

365
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,590
click and say continue so

366
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,840
it is a big issue I'm then

367
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,590
when you have the relay it

368
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,899
at the at the entry position where the
middle position

369
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:06,070
as you've seen it only season but the
content

370
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,570
soul the only thing that could do is
denial of service basically

371
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,689
because they can just stop and and I'm
not for what the traffic

372
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,009
I'm but if they fall with the traffic
I'm

373
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:21,499
and and there's not much date they can
do as a malicious

374
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:27,989
relay I'm the

375
00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:31,210
the bigger problem and what people

376
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:35,330
here from time to time with with or the
issue with four

377
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,710
an animal is a Chinook users is a big

378
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,519
research question basically the the the
question is

379
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:45,909
how can you have a low latency anonymity
network

380
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:49,789
where you expect announcer to be

381
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:54,158
to be given back to you in new
reasonable amount of time

382
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,289
you want to be browsing the web for
example so you expect its

383
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:01,859
to return the AT&T the the website um

384
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:05,590
me in a in a reasonable time Sun

385
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,809
soul that the current way the Tor
network works

386
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:12,039
is that relay races the traffic and it

387
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:15,940
either has a connection to the next
related already opens

388
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,929
a connection to the root for the next
three days immediately I

389
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:23,879
and then it forwards the traffic and
then you keep using that

390
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:26,978
path on your your client

391
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:30,679
for the the folders for 10 minutes if
the

392
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:33,789
if the exit really allows your
destination connection

393
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:36,889
so as a nice and really I can specify
what kind of

394
00:23:36,889 --> 00:23:40,149
destinations I'll based on IP addresses

395
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:45,758
Armando port points so I can lot certain
ports I can only allow certain ports

396
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,540
%uh

397
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,600
a so we have a circuit

398
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,449
and to an exit relay and its that stable
across the network

399
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,520
so they aren't really in this connection
to the middle with a middle related

400
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,540
to the axes and now you're sending data
across the

401
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,000
torn apart and you're receiving an
answer back I am so when I have a view

402
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,410
of the network but I can see the traffic

403
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:10,430
both entering to an anti and revealing

404
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,940
and exiting at some point I'm

405
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,230
I can I can do a statistical analysis
just by seeing

406
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,690
there's this area studies where they you
with various

407
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:26,170
a amount of knowledge I'm for example if
you just have the packet sizes

408
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,620
the that's that's already enough to the
anonymous users

409
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,850
um saw an attacker at that house a
you'll

410
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:39,320
over certain set of tall religious can
do that statistical analysis

411
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,649
just because for account really delay
and

412
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,820
the packets because you expect from the
low latency network

413
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,790
that you get an answer back and in a
reasonable amount of time

414
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,420
I'm so

415
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,960
if you're interested those the

416
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,930
quite old blog posts on the talkative
website

417
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,360
and this is a quote from other recent
study

418
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,520
has been made about a correlation and

419
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,000
it's quite scary um so let me just read
the

420
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,510
highlight its section and a anniversary

421
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,500
that provides no more bandwidth that
some volunteers today and the anonymized

422
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,650
any given users

423
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:25,610
within three months regulatory genes
with over 50 percent probability and

424
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,320
within six months that over eighty
percent probability

425
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,929
I so this study looked at various

426
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,210
actors only or having control or

427
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:39,560
being able to monitor or a certain
factions of the Internet

428
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,929
so the attackers that own 1as

429
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,410
or 2 S's on internet exchange point a

430
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,050
or even a larger fractions of the
networks

431
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:54,030
so this is very interesting paper and I
didn't put the address of the DART

432
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:58,399
paper because I want to also on tell you
about on on bit

433
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,990
a it's a very good and large library of
papers

434
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:05,880
around and innovation I so

435
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,930
if you're interested in the topic you
should look at that website

436
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:12,030
and it has highlighted papers like the

437
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,270
most relevant papers in the field the

438
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,800
so coming back to both problems

439
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,240
%uh maliciously lace and that I think
correlation effects

440
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,930
these are problems of any low-latency
network that you could imagine

441
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:32,040
to ever exist right because if if your
goal is

442
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,190
to being able to connects all ordinary

443
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,690
destinations that don't speak you'll

444
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,960
wonderful particle the annual will

445
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,309
house so long

446
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:47,080
will want to have someone on a network
execute your request on your behalf

447
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,189
saw in in some sense its outside of this
goal

448
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:57,440
alt or I'm but as you can see with the
Toros it was starting to address these

449
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,370
so for application-level problems and
with its TV has ever been

450
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,639
and things like that I but um

451
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:07,649
I mean we're all a for a

452
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:11,219
and two ends them encrypt the traffic to
increase

453
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,419
and soulfully maliciously lace won't

454
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,490
affect on the the usage of Tor

455
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:21,960
that much in the future and it's really
its

456
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,059
it sounds now songs like tor like every
time you use issue hits and misses with

457
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,389
any that's not the case

458
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:31,668
so our scanners find one

459
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:35,860
like every two or three weeks so it's
not really that big of an issue

460
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,908
and the traffic to the coalition tax as
you can imagine

461
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:43,749
any kind of technology that just
forwards

462
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:47,600
he was a trustee and and and sends back
um

463
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,740
the replies is affected by this problem

464
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,610
I'm the naive solution will be

465
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,049
20 send try constant traffic right

466
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:02,600
so you will you don't disclose

467
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,658
when you're executing with us or how
much data you get back but the new

468
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,710
Eurotunnel has a saturates the line

469
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:12,919
the at all time limits limit the

470
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:16,200
dummy traffic and then you can't really
use all

471
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,350
all your traffic soul domain traffic in
helping

472
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:24,230
in certain applications but to deploy on
the whole tone at work did

473
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,929
what but just generate too much traffic
because the user would expect some kind

474
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:29,519
of

475
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,799
fraction of his band with to be
available for

476
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,869
for requests and at the same time story
less

477
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:41,590
um have to receive all that dummy
traffic constantly from all the users

478
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,860
and with around 1.5 wood

479
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:48,010
up to two million users stately I'm you
can imagine that

480
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:52,480
up the current network meeting will be
able to handle

481
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,590
land let traffic and then and

482
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:59,120
there's a lot of interesting studies
that the that this

483
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,590
and and it's not even the

484
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,750
its its dummy generating dummy traffic
and making sure

485
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:11,450
that home but the line is still this is
not not a trivial problem

486
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:16,820
I another thing that you hear regularly
is that

487
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,280
some entity up some government entity or

488
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,720
whatever runs like a large fraction or
some fraction of the network

489
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,790
and that this is the reason why people
are not using it

490
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,860
um those variants of this

491
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,559
the this statement and

492
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,690
and for for for %uh the question is what
they've gained by running relays

493
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:43,340
and torture of the correlation attack
that's a passive attack

494
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:47,360
as long as I can see the traffic flowing
into that really

495
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,969
and the traffic exiting the three-day I
don't really need to run

496
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,790
any part of the and research in um

497
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,980
and then the other thing is a personal
thing I'm

498
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:03,179
I'm I'm me and and many other people at
or

499
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:07,540
um they they build relationships with
real ale courageous they know love

500
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,639
really operators

501
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,809
and we keep a close watch on who is
running what fraction open up for

502
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:16,480
was behind a who was the guy behind that
um

503
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,950
and then the third thing I usually say
is

504
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:24,770
it would actually be nice because then
we wouldn't rely on people like me to

505
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,020
to run

506
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,240
relays will be nice to have competing
agencies

507
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,800
I'm run relays for us because even if
you if you run

508
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,899
like a fraction of the religious there's
still the traffic coalition attack but

509
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,140
a you can do that without running real
es and

510
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:47,090
boats um if you issue

511
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:51,300
issue just run like the the entry level
that connection

512
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:55,280
then you don't really get anything other
than providing free band with two also

513
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,970
uses

514
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,080
and this year on Nexus related um

515
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,960
you you also strengthened enough for
fall so it was

516
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,920
because even when you run an exit really
all you can see

517
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,190
is is the destination and the cons and
you can dance

518
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,750
to see the the user IP address onto

519
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,980
soul coming back to to

520
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,920
that this is a general problem um I
always ask

521
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,560
what do you trust and then a lot of
people say I have the CPN provider

522
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,110
that I trust and even some people that
know the people that

523
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,790
to run the VPN provider but in the end
um

524
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,610
the VPN provider is it can be can be
much more

525
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:41,590
dangerous mandatory thing because they
see both the was a connection

526
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,199
and they see the content and the so both
problems

527
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,710
apply very hard also tool to be can or
any

528
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,740
any proxy I'm and if you're worried
about the traffic relations are

529
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,380
obviously

530
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,780
pippen it's not going to help you and

531
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,960
well as me we've seen from some NSA
slights

532
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,020
they kind of seem to have some more or
less automated way

533
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,629
love

534
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,040
the analyzing the cans and boxes

535
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,290
I'm I don't know too much about the
sides didn't really say

536
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:16,020
but from some slides into two words that

537
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,770
capability so

538
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,830
let's look at the tone at work because
on the one side door

539
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:26,830
is a soft one it's even more than one
software

540
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,600
its 80 browser it's that or clients

541
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,189
own relay program and then as a lot of
all the tools

542
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:38,100
and on the other hand others the network
and

543
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,149
when you when you see it like this
picture all

544
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:44,690
all stable relays running would say this
is a

545
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:49,350
but healthy not looks okay there's some
centralization

546
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:53,260
as: quiets dispute is

547
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:57,400
um but arm that

548
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,100
if you if you look deeper into its and
if you look at the

549
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:05,090
fast if you if you remove all the slow
very slow release that are not really

550
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:05,870
helping

551
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,360
much to the network um then you end up

552
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,969
at some point you end up looking at this
number and this is exit relays

553
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,370
that pump more than $1 megabytes per
second

554
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,290
so these attract the majority of the
user's um

555
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,480
and and and UCAS you know

556
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,530
miss mmm that's not a very Happy network
I'm

557
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:34,100
so that and that's that's mostly my area
I love

558
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,810
is a interests and well I'm active is
trying to teach people about how to

559
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,580
setup religious and non-religious

560
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,580
strengthen the network help others for
people on both and

561
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,919
like cult will actually run the relay
and also in

562
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,299
on

563
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:52,539
and and trying to make people aware it's

564
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:57,009
obviously and on so what I start its

565
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:00,120
the I'm well thats

566
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,360
and its that's a look at some other
tools that are interesting

567
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,060
because I'm as I said I'm

568
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,589
I'm advocating for people to learn more
about foreign people

569
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:16,659
always come and say how can I help and
in the case of a non-technical person

570
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:17,230
and that

571
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,369
don't know a two-run relay or they don't
want to our

572
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:24,339
really do with up those stairs also
other wasteful

573
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:28,649
just exploding at work and learn about
its and what we

574
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,739
at this point can use also for for

575
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:35,270
advocacy and and journalists with for
example be

576
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:39,599
visualizations of the data so that's why
I want to

577
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,629
present the current state of the both
the data and some other visualizations

578
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:44,098
we have

579
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:48,190
I so you can learn I'll from the data

580
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,429
but you can also learn that our
visualization ce

581
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:54,889
can can be vastly improved and

582
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:59,050
I'm soul if you're interested in program
this will be a fun area

583
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:03,110
are you so was just so look at this is
Asian

584
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:08,230
um methods and and take our data it's
all publicly available

585
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,470
and and play around with it um

586
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:16,350
call this is a less noam I'll tool in
the talk community that's why I

587
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:20,310
have it here home it allows you to
filter

588
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,690
all the Tory lace and the network and
only look at

589
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,970
certain I religious but the interesting
thing is

590
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:31,930
the realized by country and the rule is
my ass

591
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,620
and then you can look at the
distribution of total is based on the

592
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,400
fractional

593
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,160
of traffic that a certain country
provides for the torn-up

594
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,230
I'm and and and her life

595
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,890
Serbia and look at all really is in
service um

596
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:50,960
and this is this is so the the answer to
a request

597
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,640
the last summer total summerall the
country's

598
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,029
and and soul each country and the total

599
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,880
probability I so those

600
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,090
though some columns here and I'm like
the

601
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:09,160
exit probability so this is the
probability of a client

602
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,600
to exit in that country right I and

603
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:17,370
as you can see um it's not very evenly
distributed across countries

604
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:22,279
and more so the traffic at the point of
the screenshots

605
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:22,970
um

606
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,689
30 percent of it exit in the US and this

607
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,810
11 percent meeting 11 percent and
Nolan's

608
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:34,160
um so and this is just the top

609
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,040
no the top seven screenshots so as you
can imagine

610
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,340
one of the things we're looking into is
how can we

611
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:45,110
how how can we attract a really
operators in other countries how can we

612
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,280
find eyes peas

613
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,010
in other countries I'm and

614
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:54,060
the same for the Gotham City I didn't
talk about though it's much that you can

615
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,270
you can roughly say that's the and
rebuild probabilities

616
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:02,340
sold when you when you fire up your
clients and 27 percent of the cases that

617
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,810
you using it will connect

618
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:07,270
again to some relay the US I'm

619
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:11,480
and 22 percent other cases you will end
up in Germany

620
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,680
and when we go back to the to the major

621
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,580
known attack against for that and
adversity that can see

622
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,819
the traffic for at the entry point level

623
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,260
and at the exit point level can the
anonymous users

624
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,360
you can imagine that's the the
straightener

625
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,870
work is really important because because

626
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,970
obviously if you're very evenly
distribute its

627
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:40,529
an attacker has to be very powerful to
see if the

628
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,640
this traffic and this is not the case as
you can see from the size

629
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,580
um this assessment of the metrics
website

630
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:55,110
moment to show its on hopefully if my
connections still of life

631
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:58,650
I'm I mentioned this before

632
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,440
home so here is a look at the state of
the network

633
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,050
its I will won't go into detail but you
can you can pick from his soul

634
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,780
and the lined with

635
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,870
and the and this does a nice

636
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:18,029
I'll the whole crowd of boats

637
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:23,500
on you I'm the distribution of
relentless

638
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,530
the country more loath to this first

639
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:31,700
so as you can see this as Germany's as
just another

640
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,859
representation of the data that I sure
do in in text form into the lines

641
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,640
fans not just say it's and

642
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,670
now that's not very evenly distribute as

643
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,770
them and

644
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:49,610
the the the major reason I'm showing you
this in a bit more detail

645
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:53,010
is that on metrics

646
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:57,630
and calm her ass all use the data
provided by

647
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,740
on in on it was failing you

648
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:05,620
and it's an obstruction away from from
just using the raw data that all users

649
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:09,750
to generates some visualizations so it
sits between

650
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,970
the raw data I'm and and the

651
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:18,299
visualization the metrics and compass
and it's a it's a it's a simple

652
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,490
Jason API you can create and

653
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:24,709
it has a lot of stuff that you can
simply query

654
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:31,710
mmm I can show you one

655
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:37,560
p

656
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,759
so yeah know that I'm using life
insurance

657
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,690
it's always danger but you can see that

658
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,730
for example for the relays you can you
can get

659
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,410
nureyev the flax that are assigned to
the Rideau the country

660
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:55,009
country name reason name city name if
it's available

661
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:58,580
um the as- number so

662
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,990
the network it is located in a

663
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:05,259
so there's a lot of interesting data
available and that's why I want to show

664
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:05,830
this

665
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:09,430
because people are really aware of this
they only look at the outcome

666
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:13,350
and 80 metres and rally at the the back
end

667
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:18,750
so when you're if you're capable of
programming and such a simple interface

668
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,490
you can you can just look for
interesting data and analyze its

669
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:26,100
I'm there's a

670
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,220
this is a from the block

671
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:33,209
soul a call for for funnel web
developers

672
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,620
for Atlas and global um that wasn't
lowell

673
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:40,200
I can show you I'm

674
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,910
that suit let's use compass for example
to look at that serbia

675
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:48,520
and a on select any of the other options
so I'm

676
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,400
on selecting all relays here I I'm not
grouping them

677
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,770
so I went to see all the real issue and
this is a state-of-the-art for

678
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:57,660
conserving up

679
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:03,000
um

680
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,660
um so

681
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,430
no probably can imagine why we love it
Milos is

682
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:15,230
is strongly trying to find more people
in serbia to run relays

683
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,340
there's not much fun with the

684
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:23,310
here this those on this current that
work there is no exits

685
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:26,799
the in serbia I'm his

686
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,670
that's the current state of the network

687
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,230
I'll this the or and

688
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,050
this by

689
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,930
yes so

690
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:44,020
yeah that's what I want to show you what
this is I'll here

691
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:49,890
yes select him them

692
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:53,720
okay so this is at first this is one of
the implications that

693
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,140
we're looking for people to work on
globe is there a similar

694
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,670
at displays I information a diff

695
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:04,970
the more detailed information about
single religious so you see the exit

696
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:05,640
policy

697
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,730
and as you can see here this relay

698
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:11,730
this relay allows exiting

699
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:15,590
on certain parts I like 25 11 10

700
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,970
so this is a plant s traffic this is it
but the traffic

701
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:22,459
this is such BS I but toward doesn't

702
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:26,390
qualified it doesn't do the this really
doesn't qualify as

703
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,410
being called an exit because the exit
status and the network

704
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,740
is tights that was certain ports that
you have to allow all

705
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,879
and one other ports port 80 I

706
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,080
and I if you don't have the exit flag

707
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,069
that clients will by the bar very
unlikely to use you

708
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,940
for any exiting a so in some sense both

709
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,970
a art room there are some exits

710
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,740
and there are no excess because because
they're not really

711
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,620
very helpful unless they get the access
like a

712
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,620
like year

713
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,848
a

714
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,440
mean the resold

715
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,470
rule he's still local yeah

716
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:16,700
the enable

717
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,379
or the the because it's a like you do

718
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,670
who is the

719
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:29,240
his this to dole's yep that's them

720
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,950
yeah but by disabling port 80 I mean it
is just the

721
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:39,368
just a cheapy traffic but by that you
remove the excess like so you don't get

722
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:42,520
the traffic and offices and the rest to
postpone of

723
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,220
tool to be be a relay um but

724
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:51,410
Italy the middle no its fine like I do
believe it I don't

725
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:56,109
me it's just the rest through I is not
really suitable tool to

726
00:43:56,109 --> 00:44:00,279
conduit much it's nice it's a nice
experiment and

727
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,670
a nice little box I so

728
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:10,450
um all this data is available from only
in the

729
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:13,540
from the jQuery the today's interface

730
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:17,240
and I'm global

731
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:23,160
goes very similar if it loads

732
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:30,160
the like me

733
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,050
only

734
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:36,700
anyway so if you're interested in

735
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,910
in helping and miss Eliza as a spectator

736
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:43,270
on this is what you want to look at um

737
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:48,180
there's another reasons homie call to
arms

738
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,049
it's about the fellowship program that
is available at the moment

739
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:55,290
so you can apply for for home

740
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:59,370
working on a specific aspect of the
problem with having

741
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:04,200
and namely the problem that a lot of web
sites start using third-party

742
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,569
um block lists on or services like
culture

743
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:12,750
and Dez the services they just take any
IP address

744
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:16,930
that when they see it a abuse coming
from that IP address they block that IP

745
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:17,680
address

746
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,899
saw love exit relays are blocked

747
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,140
from certain web sites I'm and

748
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,420
there's interesting research there's a
lot of proposals

749
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,880
on how to help operate as a web sites
the

750
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,960
avoids having two blocked or users

751
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,700
completely and so this is a very sense

752
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:43,770
August 29 was released too low to me

753
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:49,340
doesn't matter it's looks like an it
should take the

754
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:52,760
the same crew strains wanted to show the
difference

755
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:59,760
32 this

756
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:00,890
so this is global

757
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:05,170
before we saw at us but the its post-its
it's basically the same

758
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:09,980
it shows the information about the relay
mmm and the exit policy in the blacks it

759
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:10,450
has

760
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:15,180
and cans home

761
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,500
so this might be very interesting for so
long cool

762
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,500
understand enough about technology but
it's it's less a technology problem it's

763
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,230
more about

764
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:27,450
providing the right information or maybe
for example one could imagine

765
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:32,000
that up for popular content management
systems that

766
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,710
we've we would develop plugins that help
you categorize you do this and say okay

767
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,710
it or user

768
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:41,240
a all comments coming from tell users
are going to moderation

769
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,459
because that will help against people
trying to

770
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,410
fill your blog with stupid comments
stuff like that so

771
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:51,680
a me it's not all on us nothing decision

772
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,720
usually you can you can you can classify
users into certain

773
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:01,129
like danger group and that's also
interesting outside its 2004

774
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:05,260
because I'm just using the IP address
and blocking all users from that IP

775
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:05,980
address

776
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,579
all this you can imagine that this is a
larger problem the

777
00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:14,599
just just that or only saw in general

778
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:17,950
the block is a very interesting website
so

779
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:21,680
have in mind and and to stay up to date

780
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,930
me you might want to subscribe to that
here I have opened the

781
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:30,149
want the and on that select the papers
anonymity that I mentioned earlier

782
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:35,300
on so does back to 1977 and has a love

783
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,339
papers soul if you have some free time

784
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:41,490
like just dedicated to this website

785
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:44,598
and he will know everything and as you
can see there's some highlights the

786
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:45,319
papers here

787
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:49,259
um that you might want to look at.

788
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:56,260
home okay

789
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:04,020
him

790
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,820
so I already mentioned that

791
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,850
apply it my my focus tour

792
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:12,319
is to look at the network and

793
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:18,140
tried to help diversify and strengthen
the network both by providing more than

794
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:18,700
both

795
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,500
so it gets faster and by providing more
divers

796
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,820
network so it gets the it strengthens

797
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:29,080
the anonymity arm so this is

798
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:33,540
this is a project I so did its part also
a statement and it's all about

799
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:37,540
operating realize London 2010 I started
doing this

800
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,259
and I I started a call for like let's
that's

801
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,730
let look let's rum and I said we lay
together

802
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:48,160
soul if you want to chip in and and give
me some money

803
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,270
I will run a large tree day and after
half a year

804
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:57,520
I had like a almost eighty percent of
the exit capability of the whole network

805
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,060
that wasn't a good thing because one
person should wield

806
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,380
responsible for for a large fraction of
the network and

807
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,530
back in 2010 it wasn't as popular as now
also

808
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:12,850
leave we managed to also find more and
more people I started to call it like

809
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:16,410
franchising and because I was

810
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:19,720
was speaking at a lot of confidence as
the with a lot of people so

811
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:24,200
i'll know where 13 organizations because
you will also want to have legal and

812
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,049
operational

813
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:29,790
diversity you don't want me to be able
to lead to access all these wheels

814
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:35,400
I'm and benefits was very helpful they
belong on this is very helpful

815
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,870
on and now we got a grant from the evil
says the Dutch foundation

816
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:43,130
on 2002 further strengthen the network

817
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:46,600
I'm and this is

818
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,720
on like a summary all whatever

819
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,330
home interesting things that I I could
imagine be interesting for you:

820
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:57,119
there's a very good email newsletter
it's called the toll we can use

821
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,330
you can just a side to I are you

822
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,960
you subscribe to the RSS feed on that
will

823
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,720
help you keep up to date loan new things
about or

824
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,149
just by reading an email every week it's
very good

825
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:15,740
I'm than the analyst I mentioned the
block altogether the block has the whole

826
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,250
week deals and more

827
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:20,380
soul if the toll weekly news is too
little information

828
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:23,980
for you subscribe to the whole blog and
then

829
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:27,020
the real way to get involved in TOR is
too low

830
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:30,590
be in IC I'll everything is happening on
IRC

831
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:34,359
and these are the the major channels
that we're using

832
00:50:34,359 --> 00:50:38,340
so that the torso the standoff early
operation it's the channel for

833
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:41,530
called development it's the telling you

834
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:44,630
or told this project is a fairly new
channel

835
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:48,849
and it's for for everything around the
project the left-sided

836
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:52,910
whatever a except for for cold in parts

837
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:56,960
so this is a very interesting channel
also if you just want to all

838
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,690
understand the community more get to
know the people

839
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,599
this is where you want to be I

840
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:06,359
me and then there's form it's it's the

841
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:09,869
the regular that channel that is know
mostly for

842
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:13,079
will like it wasn't actually was a
questions and a very

843
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:16,359
fun channel to be in sometimes it is not
for

844
00:51:16,359 --> 00:51:19,930
because there you are allowed to talk
about everything

845
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:23,879
I but it's still it's still somewhat
close to war-torn

846
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,200
so people post random things running
advantages

847
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,549
a whatever sometimes you can't read it
for days because those some

848
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:35,160
up yeah some people on there you don't
want to

849
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,759
really waste your time but it can also
be very interesting

850
00:51:38,759 --> 00:51:42,220
so um I invite everyone to

851
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,819
if you want to stay in contact to use
IRC

852
00:51:45,819 --> 00:51:49,279
I'm then there's all all made in this
the

853
00:51:49,279 --> 00:51:52,549
I guess you can find them and then

854
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:56,640
um at the end and this is my another
person mighty opens

855
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,640
and you can really read it but only as a
reference

856
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,890
some love you took pictures so no yeah

857
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:10,890
this is my tall tickets

858
00:52:18,299 --> 00:52:23,089
where a question here the for you to
enjoy

859
00:52:23,089 --> 00:52:26,499
by means I'm is world

860
00:52:26,499 --> 00:52:30,729
with the church but I'm by what

861
00:52:30,729 --> 00:52:34,678
but what if you sign its lemme

862
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:39,410
well what do you mean by being tracked
by his

863
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:44,489
me us um

864
00:52:44,489 --> 00:52:50,349
soul

865
00:52:50,349 --> 00:52:54,259
what you see at all what's that say your
website operator

866
00:52:54,259 --> 00:52:57,839
and you want to identify user all you
see is the exit

867
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:02,179
IP address so there's no way to see the
real IP address that's the that's the

868
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:02,839
purpose

869
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:06,038
home and I'm and then

870
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:09,420
you would have to go back the whole
chain all

871
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:14,249
all the network to be able to find out
what

872
00:53:14,249 --> 00:53:21,249
who was who was the using the

873
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:25,390
the yes sure yes

874
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:29,950
the lawyers please yeah where the show

875
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:33,290
the rather use use sorry

876
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:38,350
I'll says rather same

877
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:42,029
forward here is on time song he

878
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:45,760
libeled called the world

879
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,960
the up the result is

880
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,340
thrown show you this I mean it's all
online it's not I'm not

881
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:58,100
I'm in censoring will be to lemme to
stop you from

882
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,410
on getting that info isomers yes yes

883
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:04,670
other users he went with his

884
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:07,780
a good you I'll

885
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:13,890
youth correlation and in the mail

886
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:17,560
yeah so this is directly connected users
in all countries

887
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,940
so this is not only affecting serbia a

888
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:24,160
this was a botnet jumping on tour

889
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,890
so do you store as a backup plan for
communicating with the command and

890
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,940
control so

891
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,860
so it doesn't it doesn't look like they
actually use dots

892
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:37,610
backup channel to communicate with the
botnet I

893
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:40,680
but they added soul day

894
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,330
their old alt's at or clients who all
botnets

895
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:49,290
other clients to all all all clients
infected by the botnet

896
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:53,200
so every every other computer that was

897
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,109
part of the but not start its to run at
our clients

898
00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:00,750
and tore mates makes connections

899
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:04,680
even if you're not using it preparing
connections soul

900
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,990
arm it's faster if you start using it
and this is what you can see here

901
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:10,660
I was I was more

902
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,200
or my question

903
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:16,348
more other races through a certain
political

904
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:21,430
Serbia and relations I don't know I mean
I'm not an expert

905
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:25,529
a lot sorry I do our so the maybe some
of you are

906
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:31,010
so I'm we're always interested in
learning up but you can see

907
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:34,540
the the graph from serbia's very much
though

908
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,920
was very similar to the graph overall
users

909
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,250
so I can't really see it that much the
spike

910
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,369
we can maybe look beacons will go into
detail here

911
00:55:44,369 --> 00:55:50,339
but we can whose to lose world

912
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:53,359
little so

913
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:57,749
it that's a about that point is that we
don't know how many

914
00:55:57,749 --> 00:56:02,470
boats are still out there so Microsoft
was leading an effort because it was all

915
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:05,598
when dole's Microsoft was leading an
effort to kill

916
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,749
the whole botnet and they released the

917
00:56:08,749 --> 00:56:11,779
statement whether as said they they mall
this

918
00:56:11,779 --> 00:56:15,119
kill the whole thing but you're right it
doesn't

919
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,759
even from the overall he was this is
very hard nowadays when people ask us

920
00:56:18,759 --> 00:56:19,380
how much

921
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:23,759
users do you have on your network
because we lost the ability

922
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:27,180
thanks to that the stupid but thats I

923
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,220
so K and

924
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,089
the the Road he's

925
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:36,840
the lead or and or

926
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,850
line the lead but it shouldn't be

927
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:42,990
started Asia yes yeah

928
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:46,109
me that he is very interesting maybe
starting

929
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:49,230
every day because the

930
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:53,250
the rules they managed to remove lots of
the

931
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:57,560
low the mall 31

932
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,880
disposable believe their

933
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,650
his buddies low Liz

934
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:08,650
still yes because

935
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:11,690
your define what kind of trusted his
sentence will the

936
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:15,350
network but you also Knoll what

937
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:19,470
house you're taking soul as a user you
know all

938
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:24,029
already the path you taking you don't
there's no necessity tool to really

939
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:27,040
do really trace anything because you'll
build about

940
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,420
as it or use a and then you can inject
traffic obviously

941
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:34,330
and yes you can sort of trace it but you
already know the exit

942
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:38,489
cuidate the service

943
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:39,470
as is

944
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:44,450
on poland although yeah

945
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:48,020
the the the

946
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:51,440
this the go

947
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,589
collected all and or or

948
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:58,940
who I didn't talk at all about so

949
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:02,789
dote on you nor the hidden services that
or support so there was a

950
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:05,819
research arm that had there was a

951
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:09,270
the funny idea that you could also hide
the destination

952
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:12,880
by just the toy user

953
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,530
makes this connection right so the to
another its overall outside of the tone

954
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,069
at work

955
00:58:17,069 --> 00:58:20,890
but you can also use this backwards and

956
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:23,960
that the simple approach to this

957
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,750
will be to just use a only one point

958
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:32,160
a point where you meet you use this so

959
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:37,609
you'll you can imagine like it like you
couldn't think of a over in service

960
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:41,000
as the same a like a user

961
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,690
but it keeps asking some some point

962
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:48,180
in the network for for users and then
they connect

963
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:51,190
soul the other user protectors

964
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:54,220
by three months and you have a hidden
service

965
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:57,899
that more or less also uses three of us
and they meet in the middle that's a

966
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,559
very

967
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,740
rock and and and its ally it's not the
real explanation

968
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:06,759
but that's that's hidden services so it
is so this is trying to hide the

969
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,089
destination address so you can run both
sides

970
00:59:09,089 --> 00:59:12,430
anonymously by using the same strategy

971
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:15,799
and putting the server behind the three
hots

972
00:59:15,799 --> 00:59:20,140
you have you have in the middle you you
have a point to you when you meet

973
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,940
and exchange information I

974
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:27,329
wasn't enough time to all to all talk
about this whole darknet

975
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:31,770
think that's a lot of people are
interested in

976
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:35,000
well-known rumors close more

977
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,730
I'm you can configure it is

978
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:41,800
for more false I but

979
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,869
its this it's very much to start the
scorched

980
00:59:44,869 --> 00:59:48,820
and as a real operator up the

981
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:52,300
the new default is to reject this I'm

982
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:57,090
soul the the problem is that it puts the
slow to the network and it doesn't

983
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:57,690
really

984
00:59:57,690 --> 01:00:01,950
provide any benefit anonymity because
the only real attack

985
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:06,189
in this is if you're seeing the entry
connection and the exit for the actual

986
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,760
you don't care about the middle

987
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,730
you can put in a lot of stops in the
middle because you're just doing a

988
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:13,260
statistical analysis

989
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:17,640
at the entry point and yes it's so it
doesn't really have anything other than

990
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:24,640
the the chills the to network with water
I have 0

991
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:27,580
to

992
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,490
love I

993
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:33,390

994
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:37,549

I'll to 0

999
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:54,590
ish say all the way home

1000
01:00:54,590 --> 01:01:00,130
all yes soul the biggest problem is if
people who

1001
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:04,000
like you you you shouldn't last

1002
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,700
only your question and not why you want
to do it

1003
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:11,609
because I'm not allow also tell you will
how you can

1004
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:15,070
is infringe copyrights or lawyers a

we have to leave we have lawyers
presence its on the well release

1006
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,440

and of law are whom

1008

it but

1009
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:42,480
the middle of the fourth

1010
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,720
