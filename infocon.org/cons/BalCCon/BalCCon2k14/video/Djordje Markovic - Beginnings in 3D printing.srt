1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,420
that

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,030
the

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:21,020
well West

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:28,020
air whatever care to hide

5
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,449
lesson ladies adjustments many thanks to
come and

6
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,820
follow this presentation about stir the
printing my name is

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,840
Jersey my courage I'm serving I I'm

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,210
living and working it is on them working
for 3d Systems

9
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,460
the company for his overall leave their
of 3d printing solution

10
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,420
I am I

11
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,100
on the head of engineering it isn't and
I'm working

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,480
on our material production on resin

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,510
and the printer development on testing
and all the stuff

14
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,940
so I will expand a little bit about 3d
printing

15
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,039
because actually it becomes are big boom

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,320
everybody talk about sturdy printers and
they're eating bout a

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,809
the result is the 3d printing
technologies eric's

18
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,820
exists for more than 30 years and we'll
start from the beginning

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,449
with two of the cation all stuff well so
today

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,350
we'll speak if my presentation work

21
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,360
okay will speak about

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,490
beginnings about print six

23
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,039
hollow reprints what kind of

24
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,759
technologists are using what kind of
materials

25
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,570
I type of renters price apprentice

26
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,839
and all applications developed it's true
the printers and uses the

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,849
use wit to reprint this that pretty
differences are you a list

28
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:00,539
well about the beginnings the first
serial beginning this

29
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:03,679
for in the 1986

30
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:08,300
by one-man called the truck call quote
discovered

31
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,750
that 310 polarize the secrets

32
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,099
fought a mess the liquid plastics and

33
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:19,329
weekend put a layer a on the layer and

34
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,060
give I receive and have some tree the
object so

35
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,190
charcoal starts at REIT a small company

36
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,470
called through the system's and a

37
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,910
she worked on his first to the printer
printing machine

38
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,069
and should be launched process

39
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:41,230
called pastor the roughly a starter Russ
is a process

40
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,880
for us. liquid plastics in the

41
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,930
be tracked and the real polarize it

42
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,370
on trial I ultraviolet a

43
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,319
laser where per layer and when you I

44
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,260
do this the Jets true the model I will

45
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,429
for sure your summitville whole real

46
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,180
book wrote this and

47
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,780
before dis through the printing is
what's

48
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,780
from Mike jet model for visual model to
the

49
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,190
real model as you can see true the
printing pots

50
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,870
are used in automotive industry I'll

51
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,160
more presses Lee Irish ever Formula One
teams

52
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,250
or design their pots who bring their
pots to make the

53
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,650
physical tests before a

54
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,760
make your the real parts there they will
put on the

55
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,560
I

56
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,630
for Milan our car industry share also

57
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,790
manufacture so far a

58
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,670
all Toyota Motor Inn man vector squeal
designed the new prototypes

59
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,409
using 30 apprenticed to print all other
design parts

60
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:55,649
a dashboard though all plastic parts in
the car

61
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,230
for first car army interesting 3d
printing before

62
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,010
politician the concept you agree that
before we start to manufacture

63
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,970
one car and $20 million examples we have
to make a first prototype 2 validated

64
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,879
ants to see a hard to behave to correct
to the faults

65
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,738
and after that we continue its I and
utterly

66
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:22,830
and Australia reproduction have soft

67
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,060
I like 6am electronics

68
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,740
all devices shaft today simple mouse is

69
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,410
iPhone ce I mixers

70
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,280
average do a lecture a Calexico electron
device the framework this

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,630
are a scream first

72
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,650
the designed in the tree the actually

73
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,260
and after that gonna Prince them to
validate to the concepts to see if

74
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,880
be made some errors because if you made
some arabs

75
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,990
and Nicole on them all to injection
production

76
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,539
and your realize thats be made an error

77
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:04,400
lost a lot of mine and actually I

78
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,400
the tree the printing savors the money
here

79
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,039
we'll see if the process your of through
the printing with

80
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,780
liquid residents so we have Claire pull
air

81
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,349
polarized by lazem and that once

82
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:25,550
it's finished which have are pocked the
advantage over to the printing

83
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,120
to other or manufacturing technologies

84
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,360
is that we can really prints

85
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,230
manufacturer in the real everyting

86
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,430
I mean every shape a reform I it's
doable with straight if

87
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,420
printing that weekend that may be
manufactured by either investor

88
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,280
procedures

89
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,359
so you can even prints some

90
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,730
appearing quiz in plastic were works

91
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:57,550
I no like one parked and you don't have
to a sample or something just

92
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,860
or summer

93
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,110
GRC gearbox you can also print it

94
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,240
month sparked and it works its Torrance

95
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,500
and a its says a lot of time

96
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,620
to the manufacturer's for the
development of

97
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,199
new equipments and other I one of

98
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,340
procedures also Houston industry

99
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,810
is a SLs or selective a laser printing

100
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,300
that a means the TV chef of polyamines

101
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,840
plastic ball other in a vat and they
have one

102
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,369
infrared laser will melt layer for a
layup this is

103
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,479
in the industrial overall the cheapest
three different Inc

104
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,300
and parts are very similar

105
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,020
there is a so the bar so the group and
is very similar to the

106
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,039
mold injection production that's means

107
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,068
that it cannot manufacture some finished
parts

108
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:55,120
that mitch Daniels in our %uh sound
listen all the stuff

109
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,120
we'll see how it works a cat is i'd is
transferred to the Center station

110
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,679
are all the deposits a precise amount of
powder over the builder

111
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,190
the Laser centers are almost melts the
powder to form a single layer the

112
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:10,870
prototype

113
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,430
the build a rapist and lowers and the
roller deposits another layer

114
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,650
material to be centered this process
continues in a matter of hours the

115
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,440
entire part

116
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,840
has been built so that means that the
real

117
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,270
a melt long layer to that will bring a
new

118
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,490
all their father will melt it and a real

119
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,059
degrees this opt or

120
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:38,029
our part the manufacturing time in three
different Inc

121
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:41,719
the main I

122
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,580
the manner Parmenter for manufacturing
time to everything is the

123
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,219
hi to the fact I is the boxes a higher

124
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,860
that means it has more or less ants bit
more layers it brings more the time

125
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,180
but actually VR a working with its

126
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,350
some I manufacture times

127
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,960
area correct i mean weekend

128
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,570
design I dash for the fuck are

129
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,490
for in 20 days after that you have was
far are cleaning up the operation but

130
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:12,870
its

131
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:18,350
other subject other three different
source

132
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,860
we have it Inc the most other people
hurt only about

133
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,040
a rockman or open source printers for a
few hundred euros

134
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,770
that he can now order on the Internet by
by our self

135
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,490
but I

136
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,020
in the relative the picture to Pinterest
Sox from

137
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,120
thousand up euros

138
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,470
up to or 1,000,000 as you see on the
slide

139
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,000
the show personals professional and
production princess

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,120
personal princess s the name says

141
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,680
are 40 schools are for

142
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,739
the people who are non just stocked

143
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,750
it's true the printing and the college
or the pots its nots

144
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,890
something I expect the exceptional the

145
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,910
lehrer thicknesses are onto

146
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,280
0.1 millimeter and the chef to the pots

147
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,930
but to the finish in all those parts is
just to show them

148
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,500
nothing more than this after that will
go to a professional printers

149
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,240
where we should have printers that will
bring

150
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,440
old lot of kinds of plastics began print

151
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,220
also metal weekend actually and as a
maid also through the printer

152
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,740
for us routes to bring the Ford so we
can print

153
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,110
everything ought to me you can imagine
even the ceramics

154
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,380
and all the stuff after that it depends
also

155
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,430
in New what's field of

156
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,209
in the city you are and you look fine
you're a solution it's treated

157
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:54,309
printing

158
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:57,559
when the hammer is only solution think
about 3d printing

159
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:00,738
trip in tech stocks at Studio

160
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:04,049
I'll first stepped

161
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:09,639
in rapid prototyping and it's finished
like our solution for our industrial

162
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,779
production if

163
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,910
voir cans make some parts

164
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,980
on other way than if you don't if it
dont

165
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,360
make that some parts return
congressional of my linger and

166
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,559
drilling processors real started
sturdivant Inc

167
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,569
and we can find the source even it metal
parts

168
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:33,488
and it will save us some money in the
costs because in the industry

169
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:36,589
many have some I

170
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:39,829
productions of because of something bro

171
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,479
broke to end the shaft repair its less
time spent

172
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,889
to make the system running again lets
the money lost

173
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:50,069
that's why you have shows the 3d
printers

174
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:53,248
even for metal one example is a

175
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:56,339
parts I don't know do generalize what is

176
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:02,160
I injection plastic mould an injection
ingestion

177
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,299
plastic small the share price lot of the
times

178
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:08,869
some shapes cox-2 gets

179
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,360
it my lingo

180
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,890
I

181
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,660
question my link and it's Jen takes up
to five days

182
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,660
so and many if if bring the box in metal

183
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,750
we can do it in lesson Monday so we

184
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,050
saved for days of production that site
maybe the park's

185
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,189
will be a more expensive and the stock
but

186
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,420
edge and detail Dr cost-effective
solution because

187
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:37,550
a the Jets for more days for production
about

188
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,819
people

189
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,670
companies call for its 3d printers

190
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,790
entered the printing solutions we have
people like Airbus

191
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,790
Nissan BMW g6

192
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,040
for a you're hearing a

193
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,670
devices cements

194
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,520
and the list is much bigger than what
you can see here

195
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,829
I mean I didn't have enough a slight
stores so you're all clients shape

196
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,040
I i think that the car industry

197
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,199
is 10 the and medical industry on the
put the biggest clients

198
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:25,200
also its airbus is Mike about

199
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,449
materials

200
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,610
while I say a salts 310

201
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,610
print in every material rematch

202
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:38,520
the camp in the small and technical
parts rich and bills also

203
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,350
beak big big parts obvious can

204
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,970
Sheva materials resistance at them
temperature up to 100 degrees

205
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,510
so the

206
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,170
material properties are even better than
what

207
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:59,170
jewels like a plastic in the production
I

208
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,770
chef also by a comp but we can't have
also

209
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,560
materials that are convertible it's

210
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,599
human body and we can use our tree the
printer parts

211
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,870
your own in the during the operations of
patience

212
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,090
we can validate to distract us

213
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,260
for molding industry it's very important
to have a

214
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,200
a through the box it through the
printing for jury

215
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,510
for custom made ruler also I because

216
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,670
imagine

217
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,050
some Prince of Dubai corner have his
exclusive

218
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,560
by then going for his lady we gonna
design it in the

219
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,140
get softer controller cats alter after
that you gonna print

220
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,620
boxed Innovex his ring in the wax

221
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,070
once the Rings is sprinted we gonna make
%ah send malt

222
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,290
we gonna hear this we will melt

223
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,349
our shape of our muster are printed bot

224
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,520
and you keep the shape then you'll

225
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,650
comet a melted gold and have the

226
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,130
perfect the design bring and about a
resolution of renting

227
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,439
your around zero point 02 millimeters

228
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,700
that means to hundreds of one millimeter
so we can really do

229
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,810
everything with the to the pink okay the
prices

230
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,979
still are the biggest problem after the
printing but

231
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,010
weekend a lot of 6 our show

232
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,200
let's start its personal printers

233
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,910
src Perseus printers stocked

234
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,380
it's a small price Asus they're very
simple

235
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,060
and how it works it's too

236
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,750
whichever just ABS plastic extrusion hat

237
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,980
will hit the melt the plastic and put
that

238
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,750
on their plates layer by layer you can
see kind of

239
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,230
Doris thats region printed them

240
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,780
it can also have tree call ourself ABS
and communism a combination of callers

241
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:09,160
and it can be nice but those parts are
not for some technical issues

242
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,900
or degree cannot a law use them in the

243
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:19,790
any serious project

244
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,550
the bigger that the Charter the printing
is that helps

245
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,859
a lot of people in school in education

246
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,030
I mean even though doctors are printing

247
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:35,220
actually the bones and the parts of the
human body to show to the students

248
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,050
the miss you read any sprint all you
entered the caller sit on the caller's

249
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,560
so we can print what ever imagine and

250
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,449
credentialed is to the people who can
make the people understand how it works

251
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,590
if you wanna a share a cock to text you
can print

252
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,960
the whole quarter redesigns and the 1i

253
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,390
I

254
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,839
%ah constructs so than tips are short

255
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,589
Regency the people though final plan can
see heart or star talks like

256
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,740
and then we can make some correction
because corrections are

257
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,570
easier to do during the during the

258
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,900
get the design process process than once
then

259
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:21,900
when it's finished and built right

260
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,740
what the fuck of our

261
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,350
the show some technical problems but
they're gonna solve them

262
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:39,520
I hope yes

263
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,600
during the crash tests

264
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,000
one good example is I to the printer
parts

265
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,180
and cereal production in effect for
parts during a crash test

266
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,609
the have similar results

267
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,970
and that a a loss to us to design

268
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,830
up for example our kids see it to make
the tests

269
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,949
and after that when are earth tests

270
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:08,230
are such as when they are satisfied with
our

271
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,220
best shock absorption and the rest we'll
put this on

272
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,500
10 production so

273
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,809
you can see here that through the
printing weekend test

274
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:25,428
a lot of things in safety so that means

275
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:29,780
thats by tourists technology other INS

276
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,510
share these one example the team

277
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,090
on congressional made parked and 13 the
printer part on your

278
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,280
right side you will see it through the
printer part all left

279
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,549
a

280
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,700
a South Park as you can see or

281
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,360
units for normal part you need for tools

282
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,729
kept for lost on that positive have to
manufacture

283
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,480
trial standard pots your calf assembling
workers have a glow

284
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,799
ants time and the money it costs I think

285
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:06,139
I ish your prints your design box with
sturdy printing

286
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:09,498
you have the same packed same
characteristics

287
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:12,840
but it's only one parts you don't need
any tools

288
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,199
your part is ready to US one more
advantage about this

289
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,269
about

290
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:24,289
a shield equipment restarted to use the

291
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:29,340
to the printing also in for shelter
Creek meant I

292
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,129
for Omaha the air or

293
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:37,070
the earplugs to or

294
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,369
that the lining the streets all saw your
list for

295
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,490
elect proteases also for supports

296
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,860
I had the question from I'll on a
hospital

297
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,570
in sizzle on West me about some
materials because they wanted to make

298
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,408
the guides

299
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:57,860
for bones when they have to go to some
operations and

300
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,158
they wanna drill the ball other a
certain angle

301
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:02,990
they wanna I

302
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,610
prints those positioning parts in 3d
printing because

303
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,479
Ari born on every human is different so
here we can really adopt

304
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,660
a everything to the patients

305
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,000
final plant ants it did

306
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,840
it's in progress otherwise I going
through the systems are also in the

307
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,030
of on broker on project of I line of

308
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,470
cellphone smartphone a sampling where
you can online

309
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:35,240
configure our cell phone and the kind
there is a production line a tribute to

310
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,600
the pin this on everything and

311
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,620
the automatic him an effective though

312
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,669
a smart also a Swiss by your
specification if you own a small big

313
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,210
screen

314
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:48,110
call or a shape and all the stuff a

315
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,719
while

316
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,270
it's true the printing there was a lot
of technologists deal of their aunt

317
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,670
that made the improvements in my

318
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,970
for the industry because now we can even
prints

319
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:08,360
the sugar pots that's very interesting
for example for all of

320
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,500
some custom made the by the cakes

321
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,030
the 10 prints the bright and a

322
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,269
gotcha

323
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:19,720
in sugar by the Fort this weekend's can
demonstrate the writ

324
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,580
only one iPad and small trees can a
after that

325
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,370
I'll reporter a design tossed her around

326
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,010
is developing also sold don't

327
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:34,100
do anymore support Terry by our can see
designed to softer

328
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,189
and after that idk printed in ceramics
so if I wanna have a some

329
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,240
are custom-made dish plate I'll

330
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,230
I'll just design it export might get
file to the printer print

331
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,600
ants it is on it's really too

332
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,719
make I the match between the VXL

333
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,220
and Concord real early on pots I'll
votes through this can assist

334
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,539
chef actually the trees can this that
you can use it

335
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:08,389
mean I pet Rita price of the scanners
are on track on the jurors

336
00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:12,740
and we can really a scan everything even
the call you in college so for example

337
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,009
ish

338
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:17,169
if you take your I can scan your
completely shave your tradition ape

339
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:21,690
and they 10 a print of your of your it's
our eyes itch or

340
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:26,549
shaped to your computer diverting so we
can do really are treated photography to

341
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:28,350
have a physical photography this

342
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,218
I mean I

343
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:34,439
the people says there's no limit there
are the limits but

344
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:38,799
there are limits are higher and higher
as I told before if you start to

345
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,119
manufacture the food with two different
s

346
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,509
pornos a that's me that's make some
improvements in progress in the science

347
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:49,299
and technologists otherwise I can show
your hero

348
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:54,229
on the next flight this is for example
bring 2 cups

349
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:58,099
ceramic bring 2 cups on the right
picture

350
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:01,579
on the left picture I just some sugar

351
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:06,158
troops also 3d printed and

352
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,419
the the press for those a

353
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,940
machines that's all hi its really

354
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,110
affordable to the people who is
concerned

355
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:21,269
bakeries and pottery or are people who'd
like to the butter it's around 10,000

356
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:21,690
euros

357
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:26,029
so those missions are really not very
expensive and their democratic democrat

358
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:27,240
the

359
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,240
the room boarded the prices lower just
to make them affordable to everybody

360
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,370
so I actually here before he sheds

361
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,248
to the present to the to the princess
and now we can buy for all homes

362
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:43,799
alter the printer made the parts the
toys for the kids

363
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,889
I'll let them design and going

364
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:50,428
to reduce them im 3d printing and
through the world

365
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:54,820
from when they're young I don't know if
it's good or not

366
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,450
but it's what's actually happens and

367
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,360
yes 3d printing is a very very big

368
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,899
a some too big science British

369
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:09,530
it's her a

370
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,750
there's let the kitties into the system
so I into the printing soul

371
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,790
I think that we need more than fourteen
forty-five minutes

372
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:22,560
door check everyting but this year have
any questions about 3d printing

373
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:29,560
I'm sure to ask her for them agreement
to beat on repeat it

374
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:37,310
tools

375
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,790
well there is I'll hubert

376
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,460
purse sitters parts procedures are
differ on

377
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,640
banks mean Prince if state the same

378
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,100
its I

379
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,449
my tricks time vector that stinks that
means

380
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,750
layer per layer and up-to-date jet I

381
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,890
part if the sheriff X materials

382
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,300
all of our meters are not the same if
they have

383
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,470
I actually materials Saroj or use your
chef Paul demain dès

384
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,770
I mean there is a shoe kinds of three
different just so

385
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:16,610
air but the printed his lair per lei ESO
that's not change

386
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,679
for even if you wanna print it on parts
or plastic parts

387
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:26,810
we'll do it later for Leah well

388
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:30,669
about some ceramics this is a technology
I came out

389
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,980
two months ago it's not officially
presented anymore

390
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,150
and unfortunately I cannot give you more
details

391
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:41,220
about this still final really is on your
a mold in Frankfurt

392
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,610
this year and if your day are you can
see you will see me probably

393
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:51,610
on the true this is a sign

394
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:56,370
a while for every printer your share for
more or less

395
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,529
want for plastic a bring a

396
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:03,320
materials for sure one can a printer for
apollo for ceramics

397
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,200
ceramic printer forearm metal powder

398
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,600
metal printer it's really every material
has

399
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,260
on para meter sprint to permit us and

400
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,760
I'll core configurator printer sites

401
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,408
I its it's similar but

402
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:24,880
it's very different I mean venue if
you're by some professional printer

403
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,720
your contacts the and if you have a a
range of 5 a.m.

404
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,049
printing materials you can't really a

405
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:37,340
even if he is it supports 50 printing
materials of 6th

406
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,570
if you decide for one printing material
you can't really change a

407
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:45,649
with every bottle of new material to
their order use this

408
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:49,149
after that I wanna do with this and
actually show ever

409
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:53,518
made a lot of improvements and the shaft
for online the material mixing

410
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,779
so that's means a chef arquette file
assembly

411
00:25:56,779 --> 00:25:59,590
I mean some I

412
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,750
I even arm small car assembly

413
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,429
and via the we will customize the
materials for a wheels

414
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:10,169
for the ball the other car for
everything and

415
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:14,519
during the printing process are the
materials will be created for despite a

416
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,080
pox on the car or despite

417
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,860
despite other the car share weekend
optimize and even its rubber

418
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,840
weekend print the robber a harder
obverse of two rubber

419
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,449
a and sherry can optimize but you talk
about mission so

420
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,490
that costs are on style 250,000 euros
more or less

421
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,460
with a small up personal princess

422
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,669
for cheaper printers to share for

423
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:44,289
ABS material like material or plat

424
00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:47,850
and only thing Rio what you can

425
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,340
I'll modified so layer thickness

426
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,459
that's all to go faster and have a

427
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,389
first a resolution of to go slower and
have some

428
00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:01,428
nicer a resolution otherwise

429
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:05,340
it's really a for professionals and they
decide on material that

430
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,529
they know why did I did it and we can't
really change

431
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:13,669
this weekend but its two days of work to
adjust machine for

432
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:17,149
spring new type of material because
somethings

433
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:22,258
are not for the automatic yet and other
questions

434
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:29,259
yes

435
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,930
well I yes for sure

436
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,700
the two different Inc issue lists true
to the grease

437
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,710
the costs to not spend too much money

438
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:55,180
for validation to validate some call
such for some parts

439
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,760
a it's cheaper to bring them then tore

440
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,970
start a

441
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,760
production on them there deal with them
there are there is a

442
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,160
lotto calculation so you have graphics I
how many

443
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,440
if you make five thousand parts with
three different Inc it cops cheaper

444
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,470
then to make all investor processed for
does five-thousand parts

445
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,740
because those five thousand partial
gonna manufactured am

446
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,300
apocalypse like a a unique pots it will
cost you a lot of money and time many in

447
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,050
the industry

448
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:29,780
I everybody on our I lose less of mine
and the hatch

449
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:33,500
so hard that site for example a boss

450
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,230
I

451
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,549
true machines you have the shells left
and right shall

452
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:42,150
right I imagine a its 3d printing card
tricks real designed the

453
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,559
Oct ok you're gonna print it both parts

454
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:49,149
we'll see them real assemble them we
will put the electronics

455
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,530
mechanics and the chefs prototype ultra
machine

456
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:56,240
and a its four

457
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,480
the halls for schools if they are
dislocated its

458
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,730
left in the right side for one
millimeter and if you didn't see this

459
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,809
during a validation of our concept and
the

460
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:13,120
made to the malts for a serial
production for stuff always thought that

461
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,659
the money factor some think

462
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,299
we need to do it chef to repair the mall
and other operations for this kind of

463
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:18,780
molds

464
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,700
it's very expensive and we are talking
about thats a

465
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,540
thousands and thousands of dollars euros
whatever

466
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:30,220
whatever currents you want so that's why
we're

467
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:37,220
now bro

468
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,189
well at three different s are using I'll

469
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:47,210
STL files Serota graphic files and

470
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,550
I that's me but the sheva our cad the

471
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:54,080
softer retreat retreat run we will
design our pots

472
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,340
convert it into STL and after that

473
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:03,080
because to STL it some did the basis of
3d printing files

474
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,980
and that's it rich with every to the
printer comes a softer

475
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,660
for processing very real just put our or

476
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,080
parked on the

477
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,500
country different assimilate struck a
rating and then restock British

478
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,950
till converting she's on protocol on
every company CAS

479
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,559
or no processing protocols because

480
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:26,940
this is a test some industrial parks
still

481
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,750
going very very fast developing very
very fast

482
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,539
and everybody was have their money and
they give to a charity for themself

483
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:41,539
I mean nitsa

484
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,440
the parts ordered s for sure there is
lot tougher

485
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,809
I lost service bureaus a you worldwide

486
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:58,490
you send them and they can make your
quotation all online

487
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,559
you send your STL file I

488
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,760
because they tell your delivery dates
heart cost you every ticket they will

489
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,690
manufacture it

490
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:10,460
I mean I am door

491
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,650
I started to treat printing girl

492
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:16,950
my itouch first-timer twelve years ago
to the printer

493
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,970
for a couple of years ago working in the
company common factors to the princess

494
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,820
and since I stock to its true now this
kind of manufacturing

495
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,790
a

496
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:31,790
workshops for to the printing I just
exporter the quantity of them

497
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:36,210
there's a lot of 4 I think that even in
Hungary there is

498
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,220
two of them in Russia be over light it
really provides

499
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,080
never country there is a true depicting
the arm

500
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,879
workshops so

501
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,570
to send the rest he'll file to say I
wanna this

502
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,570
iron a 5

503
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,939
parts how many costs to go sure you
receive a Lassus

504
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,620
and I can tell that it's really not

505
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,639
the cheapest off from manufacturing
process it got something

506
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:09,860
if you go over on the prices assists
materials are going to okay for personal

507
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,590
princess

508
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,040
killer of material of this cubic the

509
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,629
estimate of material costs around a
70-80

510
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,680
100 euros I mean this is a selling price

511
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,770
the ABS is very the it's very cheap back
to S

512
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,940
the protection on them make the more
more money they wont

513
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:33,280
the protected summer chips inside the
new cannot you cannot put other

514
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,420
ABS a because again you get to catch a
cheater

515
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:40,470
small printed everything is inside and
even if you didn't finish completely

516
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,870
but the after 50 meters it has to stop

517
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,689
it stops and even if you are not at all
you can to in this model and the

518
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,580
use the you're on the

519
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,439
um materials because our tix protected
by our

520
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,149
I'll RFID labels aloft and

521
00:32:58,149 --> 00:33:01,590
yeah I mean the Saluda like it to the
printing

522
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:05,490
like like a glorified they sell you the
printer and after that

523
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:09,919
okay real says material and for
professional Anderson industrial

524
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,649
printers materials are going to throw
momma

525
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:17,408
300 euros per kilo up to 1000 euros per
kill

526
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:20,600
defense of the defense of their
characteristics

527
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,870
properties of the materials operate
sample some

528
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,350
our formal on many factors like a solid
petronas

529
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,969
Ferrari and others are you using as he
lay machines

530
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:36,610
me to talk to residents those the
residents are charged with a

531
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,510
some granules of four I cannot

532
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:44,610
deal of you what's exactly bucks and
it's very strong

533
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,418
and it's very light a shell

534
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:49,840
one this image turkey with the senator
ash

535
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,639
rates 1.5 kilos its even less than that
it got him

536
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,350
it's very resistant but a kilogram of
this material costs are on the one

537
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,539
thousand euros

538
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:05,620
and they buy something like tuhan there
to trick on the text on the kill us

539
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,118
in every 2-3 months so yes

540
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,349
day defense or the car accident
properties of

541
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:15,440
a what's wrong with it sorry expressed
this

542
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:22,030
this is a

543
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:27,270
more no no this is classic material a
some things like the

544
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:30,530
see a yes they are aged

545
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,990
but dawn breaks or usually lighter
carbon fiber its return calorie and

546
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:38,178
Karen fiber something clinton ants

547
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:41,609
the use them for for us for development

548
00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:45,418
and after that informal on their issue
box through the printer but the most of

549
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,569
them is carbon fiber

550
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:52,050
just because of the weight because every
gram informal hand is important so

551
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:59,050
yes express them

552
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,040
for a lot of I'll

553
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,680
parts in the industry not

554
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,649
especially for Milan yes use the parts
directly after the printer

555
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,430
I mean I am one had offered by

556
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,770
production site of material since its on
and

557
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:27,079
I share in the Indian leaders from the
machines

558
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:30,510
to the printer parts with the machines
the supports a lot of things

559
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,750
even things for regulation be 10 a.m.

560
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,839
again even though make there is are you
gonna

561
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:41,328
the website of true this is some serious
even instruments three different that

562
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:45,540
the trance the all structural rounds
through the printer that the

563
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,079
the guitar also three different and all
and the can

564
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,460
prints though on print although

565
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,430
parts we will do mechanically and after
that with all electronics electrics and

566
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:56,990
Kev

567
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,520
I functional prototypes yes

568
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,150
the show ever before this I was working
in the company cause manufacturing gotta

569
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:09,309
first among the factors links for our
security inks and liver

570
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:12,480
I'm making hours designing and making
the

571
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,300
that the detectors and there was just
putting optical party tight

572
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,410
and the rest was truly printed or a
rapid prototype

573
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,490
made so weekend all over a lot of things
and we approach to really

574
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:27,700
a up prototype to in national parks to
use

575
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,629
and the the distance was before a review
very very big because twenty years ago

576
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:37,650
a true difference that part you look at
it breaks now share a fax from things

577
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:42,359
and a lot of people by small print us to
make a

578
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:46,348
parts for their coop terse I mean I

579
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:49,470
my one of my heart is a skydiving and
they made some

580
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:53,069
supports for my GoPro cameras into the
printing and

581
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:57,640
heaters is 200 kilometers south our
offer free fall in all the stuff so it

582
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,129
the turks other as a otherwise I would
never say that's works it for his

583
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,530
identity turks really a

584
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:10,530
yes

585
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:20,100
its applied during the printing and it's
applied on the

586
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,420
first two millimeters although

587
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,970
box your print and the

588
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,100
liver creates 396 call us

589
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,420
and its makes very very realistic

590
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,450
figures parts

591
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:40,990
puppets I don't Dolce call it all you
want because it's

592
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:45,259
still quite strange to see somebody to
make the through this channel the person

593
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,790
to bring this in to see the same

594
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:50,100
a blasted but realistically it's a small
so

595
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:55,200
dad its its priests during the printing
and that there is few procedures for

596
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,609
this

597
00:37:55,610 --> 00:38:00,290
on oh this is so read some cherry costs
of the material change the caller

598
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:01,640
reports not to the caller

599
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,250
but to some saw once and it kills just
ring the call our own

600
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,630
Dez the defense com any a solid support
yep a

601
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:13,330
next question yes

602
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,480
while

603
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,260
it depends for what if it somehow I A

604
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:27,700
eat some things that foster but
deficiency if you if you have some holes

605
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,930
for some blocks that you can't make
retard room a shame because it's a deep

606
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,879
inside Indonesia tomahawk

607
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,790
curve and something like this then they
only solution is a 3d printing

608
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:43,940
or like a short on the slide before are
you need the

609
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:47,350
five days a tent it also fifties close
to make something

610
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:52,259
look like but sometimes we need only one
block every two specific all

611
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:57,220
I'll structure inside and shapes inside
sold only two different agence

612
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:01,700
helps us yep so it depends what you need
for some

613
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,910
simple pots it's cheaper to delete but
for some very very complicated parts

614
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:13,910
only way to do it isn't really printing

615
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:34,170
while the probability is a smart idea to
invest in them

616
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,660
but otherwise I don't think that will
change the

617
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,810
Malden gained big productions I've been
in China deal still

618
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:45,720
a do are more production and that's 3d
printing

619
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,700
for our ya they will still the
production but

620
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,129
three different things for us to fulfill
Behringer some another way of thinking

621
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,290
of creation and design it will develop
all

622
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,560
a techniques around the printing

623
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,580
like a treaty designed with the 3d
glasses

624
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:08,490
and apana the to the pan envy your dress
designer I in front like a heater

625
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:11,549
it will bring your YouTube yeah it'll
bring us in some love you till the

626
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,800
relative and for some

627
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,830
really specific parts stay right there

628
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:21,600

629
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:26,180
it overheats it is very interesting so
shoot and otherwise

630
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,460
the applications of the reprinting are
did

631
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,510
address are developed after 3d printing

632
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:36,930
be stocked with 3d printing twenty years
ago two or 230 is a go

633
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,270
because the to such to

634
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:43,509
make the life easier for mechanical
engineers more or less

635
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,090
actually the show ever

636
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:49,020
a everything is printed in 3d and the
thought of what else even

637
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,670
I'm you can't bring the cord Europe your

640
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:04,500
also and the it's really are

641
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,530
wide range of publications after the
printer not sure a specific a 3d printer

642
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,220
stores

643
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:14,020
for specific applications but it real or
call or a lot of things

644
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:18,480
lot of a few of your spots beer mall the
production will still continue

645
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,670
that's for sure because the car don't
have enough of printers to manufacture

646
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:26,220
so many pots any other questions

647
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:30,609
while

648
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,450
then thank you to listen I hope it was
not so in awe and wonderment

649
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:41,450
discover any questions like your truth
is you can just ask

650
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:49,790
