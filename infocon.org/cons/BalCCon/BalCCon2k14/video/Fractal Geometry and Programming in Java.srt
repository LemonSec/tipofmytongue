00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:20,900
well West

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:27,900
the care to hide

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,840
dollar done the word Osman now

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,850
balk on opened on CBT vision was our
frontal argument do you program your in

6
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,710
your 'we're

7
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,750
are tilted on him with it in English
community could

8
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,480
our home fractal geometry

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,730
and programming in Java today just for
you

10
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,319
are we are going to

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,320
are begin in a second monkey

12
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:09,378
mmm-hmm

13
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,690
home once again a good afternoon
everybody and welcome to fractal

14
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,030
geometry and programming in Java

15
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,230
I'm going to give you an introduction to
chaos theory

16
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,150
and complexity a new kind of science

17
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,550
are there has been ruling the world
scenes

18
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,679
seventies of 220 century

19
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,990
are then we'll move on to the
exploration

20
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,020
video feedback fractal and the program
that I'm currently developing

21
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:53,020
arm so

22
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,780
art chaos chaos his

23
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,910
mixture more randomness irregularity

24
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,570
and regularity nature is chaotic

25
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,649
it is both ordered and disordered in

26
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,150
time in space chaos alongside

27
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,430
symmetry is the key to its beauty

28
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,800
novelty and wonder chaos

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,610
is produced in deterministic processes
of nature

30
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,640
such as the calculation

31
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,380
on the logistic map are here EC

32
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,140
the logistic map order logistic equation

33
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,570
it's an iterative equation that begins
with a

34
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,359
fixed valuables parameter arm and X

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,600
0 arm logistic map is deterministic

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,000
because it always produces the same
result for the given

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,150
input if we repeatedly calculate

38
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,700
the new results by using the previous
results we can obtain

39
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,170
ordered or overall chaotic behavior

40
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,230
so here we can see

41
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,970
a plot updates are met or equation

42
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:16,580
overtime enough one aspect is ordered
because already

43
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,670
all the values output values form on to
despair bolick curve

44
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,010
however if we are

45
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,290
if you consider its time series

46
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,450
or the signal that it is outputting we
conceded

47
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,299
it is unpredictable

48
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,010
or random so for certain parameter

49
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,910
are and initial value of exit 0 the
logistic map produces

50
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,030
chaotic results the signature

51
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:53,090
deep I'm so sorry

52
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,230
you for certain parameter are

53
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,720
and initial value x0 the logistic map
produces chaotic results

54
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,490
the signal that you see plotted below
never repeat itself

55
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,490
and yet it to give

56
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:13,700
exhibits some degree of order since all
the values fall onto disparate Balika

57
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,179
curve

58
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,530
at the high school they teach us to
analyze this social equation

59
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:23,179
as a parabolic arm curve in

60
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,290
analytic sense it is a quadratic
equation but

61
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,040
when we use it as a nutritive equation
it sexually

62
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,190
the source endless novelty

63
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,840
and chaos um

64
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,479
hmm well is there any rule to it or any

65
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,720
arm and you or law well yes armed the
mathematicians

66
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,460
brew that any infinite loop I such as
this one the

67
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,280
iteration that calculates a map in
discrete-time steps or

68
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,750
a system of continues differential
equations in three dimensions

69
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,820
can exhibit chaos hear in the background
which we can see the

70
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,340
themes flame fractal their fantastic for
simulating

71
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,919
to be loans and they're very quick fast

72
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,880
to draw all arm

73
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,719
basically

74
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,120
are I want to go back just for a second

75
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,610
and try to explain to you one small
thing so

76
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,950
if we interrupt this calculation and
restarted

77
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,120
it will produce the same result again

78
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,640
so is it too chaotic or not just it is

79
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,090
chaotic you need is a random it's just
that it repeats itself if we restarted

80
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,299
but if we interrupted and attempt to
restart it by

81
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,410
reinserted the value of axe

82
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,620
it will not continue

83
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,670
as before because it is very sensitive

84
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:00,200
to all the number decimals contained
within

85
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,830
the parameter acts I'm so very relaxed
so

86
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,130
in essence it is sensitive

87
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,130
to all the decimals did you reuse

88
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,540
to calculate this logistic map and due
to the sensitivity

89
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,330
it cannot continue as before this is
called called

90
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,750
the are sensitivity to initial
conditions

91
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,970
and teaches source all I care to city

92
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,270
or randomness armen

93
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:36,799
let's continue arm

94
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,250
normal definitions system are necessary

95
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,120
arm kim's theory can give us

96
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,430
new perspective on nature what seems
like

97
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,820
exchange of input/output information
between

98
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,680
living organisms in nature becomes

99
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,720
a single equation we may view living
organisms

100
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,520
and nature as a single equation or a
single system

101
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,030
organisms acquire information respond in
non-linear fashion

102
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:12,380
and attain unity with the natural world
in the background here

103
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,229
are we see I a metabolic map of human
organism that shown different pathways

104
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,630
between genes and dimes and metabolites

105
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,740
demonstrating that the drug used to
target one gene may have several

106
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,389
different

107
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:27,820
fact and consequences on other pathways

108
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,039
mom

109
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,820
emergence emergence is

110
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,969
how complex things develop overtime

111
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,370
by starting from only the fundamental
law of nature

112
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,000
depicted here as a particle process
diagram

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,180
chaotic signal could be the source of
ideas

114
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,400
that evolution can refine some

115
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,479
Armon

116
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,240
we're not going to are

117
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,340
mmm to another lecture

118
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:11,340
somebody else's lecture at the TED
Conference and see the famous physicist

119
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:14,159
mareeg alman nobel-winning physicist

120
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:21,159
speak about emergence

121
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,969
they follow from the fundamental theory
they are what we call

122
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,430
emergent properties you don't need

123
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,659
you don't need something more to get
something more

124
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,970
that's what emergence mean life can
emerge

125
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,100
from physics and chemistry

126
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:55,510
plus a lot of accidents the human mind
can arise from neurobiology

127
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,839
and a lot of accidents a

128
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,610
the way the the chemical bond arises
from physics

129
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,850
and certain accident heart is so what
was the

130
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,589
margolin trying to say he's a his a
physicist

131
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:13,300
you know and are his view on nature is
that

132
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,979
the nature is in essence
quantum-mechanical

133
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,980
which means that eat a it rests

134
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,000
on our bro bill is stick nature

135
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,350
all are elementary particle interactions

136
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,649
but we know that even are

137
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:34,700
microscopic systems there deterministic

138
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,050
are capable of producing randomness

139
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,699
and chaos and nature is in fact

140
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,459
unpredictable and he's capable of
producing

141
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:50,689
are very interesting behavior and very
rich landscapes

142
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,740
so let's see we were really

143
00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:00,740
arm

144
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:10,540
this is a complicated

145
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:22,060
in how home this is

146
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:36,459
so let us return now to the maps

147
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:41,118
or equations that we saw are in
particular the logistic map

148
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:44,629
different parameters and variables can
be visualized

149
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:48,499
and did these visualizations represent
the origin

150
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:52,029
all very very interesting images

151
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:55,199
and graphs the that have that possess
great

152
00:10:55,199 --> 00:11:02,199
artistic value arm

153
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,360
I'm just like to mention that to briefly
as mara gal

154
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,670
under businesses that use or is the fuck
the founder of Santa Fe Institute

155
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,110
for complexity research now

156
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,150
are we contest how many iterations

157
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,120
are required to reach a limit of some
kind

158
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,140
collars shown here represent

159
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:37,439
these numbers the most famous chaotic
landscapes that you see here

160
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,010
are Julie up for doctor hall's they

161
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,319
arise from testing each individual point
on the plane

162
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,510
retest accordance as input parameter in
a math equation

163
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,160
and its rigid to see how fast the given
many bridges

164
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,420
limit we have set the caller's are
assigned to the cordon

165
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,229
according to the number of cycles that
it takes

166
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,100
to reach that limit so

167
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:09,400
are in a few simple steps or perhaps I
should say in a single

168
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:15,050
equation we generates complex landscapes

169
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:20,680
that reminds that remind us all are
lands landscapes that we can see

170
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,449
on the planet Earth so here's our
forests data

171
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,670
has surgeon wraxall properties

172
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:34,290
or certain coolness intricacy of details

173
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,550
complexity as well as self-similarity

174
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:42,010
where self lied to me is that the
branches surgeon biting into smaller

175
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,890
branches

176
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,970
hence open so forth are all

177
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,080
forests can be conceptualized through a
single simple model

178
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:57,180
using fractal geometry arm

179
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,400
met

180
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,400
maps are essentially equations thats
input

181
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,439
accordance and the

182
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,150
map it to somewhere else

183
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,640
or shall we say more words 22 another
location

184
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,230
so there morphing the plane in which we
find

185
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,490
some perhaps image and resupplied

186
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,400
which refraction through the water are
are

187
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,270
arm a good example alva mapping

188
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,870
perhaps it's too complicated arm

189
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,050
sometimes it's simpler to demonstrate

190
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,469
the mapping with a lance simple lands

191
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,440
bout so here are an example will do with
water as well

192
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,930
arm so

193
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,770
are want to see what it means to map
something here we have

194
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:56,770
a complex function at at all

195
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,460
Zad equals said where's that is a
complex

196
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:05,330
number which denotes the core didn't and
if we take this image

197
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:09,040
as a plane and map it onto itself

198
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,300
we'd get the same exact image

199
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,640
as the original however if we map it

200
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,170
with the Met minuses ed we get something
dads

201
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,510
that seem to have a lot of lip sides or

202
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,030
are reversed sides so if reply

203
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,480
another map to a gym dramatic image the

204
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,990
in rivers of sad we obtain a very

205
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,650
complicated and interesting image arm

206
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,510
since this is a course in computer
programming you should be aware that

207
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,020
there are far too many

208
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,670
arm balcom Flyers around

209
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,040
this image which indicate the that the
computer

210
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,260
is reusing the same balcom flyer to feel

211
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,430
the plane up to infinity because a
single poster or flyer

212
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,930
as we call it is not sufficient to cover
the whole plane into

213
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,839
are engage the viewer in

214
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,410
these the visual transformation

215
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:16,800
or beauty as we say

216
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,599
while no let us briefly jumped to

217
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:27,600
are are other interface on

218
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:44,638
let's take a look hats my program which

219
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,290
are uses this social transformations

220
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,860
to generated fractal

221
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,290
so we shall story here

222
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,868
one

223
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:04,129
geometric transformations

224
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,149
are are applied here

225
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:11,639
some call them image morphing some call
them

226
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:17,679
conformal transformations when we repeat
any chance for mission

227
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,170
several times to the same image

228
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,939
reproduce very interesting fractal
images

229
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:28,139
and repeating the transformation

230
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,569
geometric transformation is also known
as recursion

231
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:35,949
in this video receive more than one
transformation more than

232
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:39,329
one met equation whose

233
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:45,378
parameters are continuously changing and
he re

234
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:49,529
we have some artworks from a
photographer Mohammed immunity desert

235
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:50,369
the mosques

236
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:53,610
in now Iran arm

237
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,250
they are also transformed are

238
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,470
con formally with special lenses kind
lenses that we cannot afford

239
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,069
except if we do programming

240
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,500
arm very similar to

241
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,900
fractal world's perhaps it's an art form
that

242
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,540
has a been present for centuries of
positive years

243
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:24,540
in around here

244
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,899
so arm

245
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:35,168
these image transformations that I been
mentioning

246
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:39,259
are are discussed in a variety of ways
and this variety

247
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:43,690
is preventing us from learning and
finding information online

248
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,399
because mathematicians are using
different

249
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,918
kinds of phrases to denotes are

250
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,049
geometric transformations so their
conformal image mapping projections

251
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:58,418
projection maps

252
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:02,389
image morphing and you can't even
discuss it with mathematicians unless

253
00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:02,809
you

254
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:06,408
peak commitment mathematician who
studied it in

255
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:10,529
a certain way arm well now we'll move on

256
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:13,869
are in we have a little bit

257
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:17,889
I'll all of from home

258
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:21,719
well I'm not sure how she's def
described have

259
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,940
really complicated presentation mode
here

260
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:31,030
in Ono

261
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,780
but no yes Michelle

262
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,810
have a look death here are 20 so

263
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,620
are I'm going to no move on to the
classical video feedback our Twitter

264
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,629
feed back arched

265
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,950
has been present for on Hot 100 years
and

266
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,110
its the source or fractal as well

267
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,919
are there are are the other

268
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,320
occurring when we point the camera at
the TV screen

269
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,780
arm and this is a situation in which

270
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,220
arm in which are

271
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,700
the images transformed

272
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,580
many times recursively so

273
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,689
are let's look at some of the works from
the

274
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,160
local artists use this technique

275
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:25,010
today the following is a brief
demonstration my specific explorations

276
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,460
in video feedback

277
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,370
it starts with a video projector and a
white wall this karen is wired

278
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:37,370
the projector and pointed at the same
services the projector

279
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:41,929
result is a video feedback little every
changing the angle zoom

280
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:45,450
or other settings on the camera is
replicated in the image many

281
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,889
40 because it affects were discovered
soon after video became

282
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:55,889
readily available

283
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,200
now here's a group

284
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,070
from my Europe whom I met few years ago

285
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,870
this very place they had their
performance they hired

286
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,870
the graphics adapter backed itself and
used Open GL

287
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,989
are

288
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,610
to transform

289
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,909
visual image in this video feedback long

290
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:28,670
in a different kind way home the one
that does not really include a camera

291
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,940
or the strange other graphics adapter in

292
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,900
telco systems performed DVD amid a a

293
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:42,809
festival and this is an art form

294
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,809
that uses conventional

295
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:48,660
Cameroon stream and the mir what you see

296
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:55,660
right here is the mirror image

297
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,350
you can test these things using are

298
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:05,610
separate rigid a webcam and your
computer screen

299
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,928
soul for all those who are interested in
are learning more about these linear

300
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:11,159
transformations

301
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:14,370
the so-called lynyrd geometric
transformations

302
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,449
they can visit this sole web link down
below

303
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,669
and what you see on this image is a TV
set

304
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:24,169
position in the corner made to mirrors

305
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:28,080
and it is quite difficult to draw
swatches watchin dis image but

306
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,600
a are its its its the case

307
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,750
it is what would be your are producing

308
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,950
is a kind of a fractal tree it has this

309
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,029
a blue she look because of the

310
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:44,850
light amplification repeated light
amplification

311
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:50,889
through the video feedback loop arm

312
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:54,350
arcade I want real straight you

313
00:21:54,350 --> 00:22:00,789
more arm bollards

314
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:07,789
these linear transformations I'll see if
I can

315
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,550
home linear transformations

316
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,629
no hooker when we are for example

317
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,940
are

318
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,910
mirror and image so this axis here

319
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:29,480
servers as are as

320
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,990
as the source over geometric
transformation in this tax is here also

321
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,160
serves to produce more

322
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,290
fractal did the

323
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:45,110
linear transformations are really easy
to define in here

324
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,520
it only takes 3 are

325
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,330
3 pieces of data the position of this
three points

326
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,409
alright

327
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,520
so

328
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,440
let's move on to my program perceptron

329
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,520
from

330
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,840
you will notice that its it s some

331
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,550
degree of similarity to other video
feedback programs

332
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,610
and the here

333
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,350
is the his

334
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,669
how it looks in in NYS collar ok collars

335
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,780
yes it's black and white this is the
default setting

336
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,090
it is the source a video feedback
fractions in its current

337
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,340
the unique in the whole while

338
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:42,340
wide world so

339
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,310
I'm going to show you a little bit

340
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:54,310
of what I recorded units before coming
here

341
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,060
so here we have a arm

342
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,540
persistence arm

343
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,940
banner or a title more in the world

344
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,770
than meets the eye and

345
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,920
the geometric transformations in
question

346
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,700
he's simply the mapping said combined
with some other

347
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,910
maps for special fact this

348
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,710
the series or different videos

349
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:44,190
George connected it can inputs alive
while

350
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,930
video stream from the internet or from a
webcam

351
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:54,290
and the only stream as I can input right
now is the CNN International

352
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,930
are which is because I'd do not really
have any

353
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,820
internets televisions description so

354
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:06,070
you will forgive me for presenting you
the CNN news

355
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:12,418
cause I'll Ste

356
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:15,380
this is all all live in June in a sense
that

357
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,750
are these animations were created in
real time

358
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,750
this is real time a graphics

359
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,780
and the it is

360
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,990
the the program itself is designed in
Java

361
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,169
the latest version has been compiled

362
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:39,169
Java version taste

363
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,620
mmm here you see that perception can

364
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,209
inputs are the Facebook stream

365
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:37,020
and displayed for me home the recording
is perhaps not so

366
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,720
good because it is compressed highly
compressed this is a

367
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,000
the development I'm inteligente idea

368
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,650
Community Edition so how does perception
work

369
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:51,150
well we're going to are hurry up with

370
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:56,799
Heath explanations so it's a program
written in Java language for Java

371
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,590
platform

372
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,699
it's a virtual computer that runs on all
operating systems

373
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,630
right now each has been tested in three
operating systems

374
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,929
it began in 2007 as a saldovar

375
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:12,520
a student college work by Michael rule
and

376
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,010
I continued some four years ago are
there of

377
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:21,540
arm I've been starting its for two years
and writing it for another two years

378
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,010
it's currently hosted at sourceforge.net
dotnet

379
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:31,340
arm perception is a

380
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:36,030
Java Swing applications which means that
is using library to display windows

381
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:40,480
are right now are job i fix will

382
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,840
probably replace swing but we will
continue to be

383
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,010
updated are it's it's a new kind of work
you way to display windows and stuff

384
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:53,520
perception runners buffered images isn't
graphics 2d object

385
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,340
directly into J frame but with graphics
translation methods to fit d-mich

386
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,570
inside the window and it is possible to
use

387
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:05,600
are Open GL alternatives for graphics

388
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,168
and above them all NJ monkey is amazing

389
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:13,330
written health is are silly

390
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,350
and G monkeys absolutely phenomenal

391
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:22,918
arm

392
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:23,650
dick

393
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:24,570
are

394
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:28,139
on

395
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:28,869
so

396
00:28:28,869 --> 00:28:33,978
she liked to position this slide

397
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:37,029
in here are

398
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:41,489
okay so arm perception uses graphics 2d

399
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:47,229
object and its inactive rendering
application

400
00:28:47,229 --> 00:28:52,859
that is similar to the this is similar
to the game

401
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:56,899
engines or game games as programs

402
00:28:56,899 --> 00:29:02,839
and the as such it has an infinite loop
this runs in a separate

403
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:06,089
processing thread apart from the swings

404
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:10,059
event dispatch thread which updates the
window contents

405
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:13,809
so are you need to run all the even a
components

406
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:17,399
using the evil invoke later methods but

407
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:20,768
the active rendering hope is run
separately and

408
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:24,849
that does not always work perfectly so
we use a small hack to prevent our

409
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:27,779
problems in Windows by making the main
class 6-10

410
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:31,019
J frame class for the whole problem
begins with this

411
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,119
social with would do statement

412
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:41,119
arm and the

413
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,159
throughout the years the only difference
between Windows and Linux

414
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,840
was in the backslashes in the way you do
know its

415
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,408
paths to files but now there is a

416
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:57,470
but there are more differences this year
are so open job for Linux

417
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:00,980
is more resilient to code it breaks the
conventions

418
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,090
how you run different threats and stop
its resilient

419
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:09,220
and faster are open Java exhibits
unexpected behavior when taking

420
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,919
screen snapshots and gets it works
faster than the time it takes grab a

421
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:14,330
renewed to hide itself

422
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:19,059
a mysterious property thats is probably
some kind of the park

423
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:26,059
from open jar for Linux is faster than
Oracle jobs for

424
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:33,320
reno's perhaps you too OS response to
high-quality graphics settings such as

425
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,120
these

426
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,739
those are so-called run drinkin see if
anyone is you're interested in

427
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,610
programming Java Java original

428
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,649
are Oracle Java Windows has

429
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:47,959
terrible barging into it runs at lowest
Cebu Chews Asian level with summers

430
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,880
way ATI Radeon graphics driver so there
could be companies around the world

431
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,240
there's a running the application said
like 1.4 gigahertz

432
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,830
instead of for gigahertz because

433
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,949
are someone is updating their drivers

434
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:07,690
like graphics drivers or up our options
in Windows

435
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:12,299
and it's it's open to to really low
performance in Java

436
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,960
are and it's been going on for a long
time

437
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,370
are right now I don't have diz problems
in my desk

438
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:23,070
you computer but it exists it's about
the

439
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:26,158
a CBS show jeweler and power to choose a
shin

440
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,669
of Windows he its it doesn't happen in

441
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:33,049
Linux perception doesn't use
synchronization which means that

442
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:37,760
its the we we do not use the
synchronized keyword

443
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,020
to synchronize any elements of most the
camp calculation

444
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:46,560
in this way we accomplished 30 percent
are greater speed

445
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:51,360
so harm how does perception work

446
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,760
arm perception

447
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,500
are operates a which into gym dahmer's

448
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,800
arranged in Tables all the tables
possess the same format

449
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,750
but this is the table 1 in essence it's
a cord used system

450
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,820
ish elements is a number pair ora Coren
or according to NAR

451
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,960
number also known as a complex number

452
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,090
so are if you're a mathematician you
will know

453
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:23,929
are that are that you can write it down
like this

454
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:28,520
this is the matrix notation and notice
the D in

455
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:33,720
indexes are are designed for
mathematicians while programmers

456
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,620
years use different indexes sapir would
be 00

457
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,870
not said 11 so

458
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:45,219
arm the table 2 is of fundamental
importance

459
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,880
it is a table that contains be
calculated values

460
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,030
most complex function past all

461
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,440
Zad wears Ed is taken from the

462
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,090
table 1

463
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,459
d which contains the coordinate system
the we wish to

464
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,470
use to drawl

465
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:09,500
fractures and other things soul for
example

466
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,380
if their officer is the universe is add
which means

467
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,080
this ban we take your each point from
table1

468
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,199
and calculates and desert you once
storage and a lookup table

469
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,890
never calculated again until we change
the map or equation

470
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:29,110
table 3 E's the gradient

471
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,110
it is a simplified image with reduced

472
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:37,100
data content its just black and white
from 0 to 255

473
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,310
shades of grey from black to white

474
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,899
arm

475
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,120
and the table for which is about

476
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,590
to he year is the bailout many chicks

477
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:53,310
the notation seems complicated but it is
a essentially a table that stores

478
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:57,590
information whether the given value

479
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,939
in the lookup table is very big a very
small if it's bigger than

480
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,750
the limits circle that fits within the
screen then we say

481
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,810
all this bigger but if it's smaller than
its a always smaller

482
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:14,190
so we know for each value that from the
lookup table whether it is

483
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:18,070
beyond the limits over circle that we

484
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:22,720
arm define tables that contain pixels

485
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,409
are images and we have to have those the
screen and a temporary screen or the bar

486
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:27,819
for

487
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,170
past so all that they all tables that
contain pixels

488
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,430
are images by pixel we mean collar

489
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:37,600
and collar is stored as integer number
for example

490
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,159
if this is the intrusion number the

491
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,629
it is divided into three sections each
section denotes devalue of the

492
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:50,070
collar red green blue

493
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:53,870
I think so are you need to know these
things

494
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:57,330
are if you want to program graphics you
need to use

495
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,779
into numbers because it's fast and its

496
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,270
it's a built-in to the Java language

497
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:08,380
all tables possess the same format their
squares

498
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,230
okay there there the simplest to work
with but for Speed purposes

499
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,260
each table is stored as a single longer
a

500
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,300
so you cannot have a two-dimensional
table you need to have our

501
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,520
up all very longer a need for speed:
purposes

502
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,710
and then work everything like that so
this is the most

503
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:29,120
are intriguing and most complex are

504
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,710
slide as you'll see today art this is
the

505
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:37,200
perceptron algorithm are it it stems
from the

506
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,350
video feedback cycle as we have seen

507
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,450
examples

508
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:44,450
that use a camera and

509
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:49,290
TV screen so we have the screen here and
we have the bar for

510
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:53,420
or tempers screen in all the visual flow
goes from the screen to the bar from

511
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,390
and back and in between there's a
transformation going

512
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:01,118
so if we start are by opening

513
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,079
the opening the first pic solved by
offers cream Reiss a

514
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:09,000
all what are we going to put here we're
going to put the collar

515
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,200
that we find at discreet but we're

516
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,118
at the location denoted by

517
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,040
our values that new which is stored

518
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,460
im the lookup table at the same

519
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,490
index location has the bar for

520
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,049
index that we're trying to feelings

521
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,400
so are we read the same index position

522
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,440
lookup table bailout matrix and radiant

523
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,990
so all these tables are

524
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,109
read and written in coordination

525
00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:47,230
we apply a single index and the single
index

526
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,550
is where were in the same index

527
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,670
is where we find the

528
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,920
value that goes into the equation are

529
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,510
and then we read the column from the
screens so we write

530
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:06,460
to the same index position in the
bathroom as let's see how it goes

531
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,700
at two locations that you at the screen

532
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,589
we read the pixel from the screen and we

533
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:18,339
really read this values that you use a
fixed value are from lookup table

534
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:21,759
if the said new location is within the
limits circle

535
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,380
week oliver pixel found there

536
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,160
which means berch re switch from red to
blue

537
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,598
or perhaps from whites to blacker from
black to white

538
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:35,950
otherwise you've said use outside of

539
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:39,859
the limit circle remix its collar with a
collar love the grey jeans

540
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:43,619
indeed becomes mixed redress the

541
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:47,130
image found at the screen in the image

542
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,690
the gradient

543
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:53,340
and color inverted if their new location
is beyond the screens edge

544
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,650
we use linear transformation to contract
said new location

545
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,370
and read pixel data nonetheless

546
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:04,839
are so the linear transformation refers
to this here

547
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,130
if does a new location refers to

548
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,870
or something that is beyond our memory
size

549
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:17,180
the size of the screen we you some see
the transformation

550
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,609
to reduce jus Corp contract that number

551
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:26,230
and read information from the screen on
the last so we get a lot of crop is

552
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:30,480
ridin call peace ridin copies or
everything found at the screen

553
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,450
it become so complicated that it is
silly once I went to college to discuss

554
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,160
this with the

555
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,020
with an expert in differential equations
and chaos theory and we could not

556
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,140
discuss it

557
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,720
even though he's an expert and I made
the program so

558
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,709
are it's not like I'm invented really
these shapes

559
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,770
the simply appear naturally

560
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:57,790
arm all the complex shapes and fractal

561
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:02,180
that we seein perceptron arm

562
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:06,020
so let's move on to some more

563
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,759
analysis are

564
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,140
this is the similarity between
perception on

565
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,250
and the classical video feedback

566
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,570
it's basically classical video feed
feedback has this sort have

567
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,950
image within image with an image
appearance

568
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:28,600
and perception has consumers reading
consumers within contused other

569
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,140
circular arm

570
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,140
and the reason why they're interchanging
collars

571
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,730
is because in each iteration the
coloring virgin everything that was

572
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,510
found

573
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,570
at discrete so its flickering all the
time

574
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:47,890
and also are this is the generation one
decision Russian

575
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:53,310
to this generation 3 45 so depending
from the frame rate you have distorted

576
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:59,308
each a fractal as you go in Ridley

577
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:02,490
the it's more aged here EC are

578
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,959
different presence addition
transformation this is the map sad

579
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,039
in the first row this is the No

580
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:13,329
DD transmissions that and deserve been

581
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:16,369
linear transformations emphasized

582
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:20,980
that shown the contraction of the
off-screen point back to D

583
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,670
screen surface but a

584
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,680
which generates be sort of a fractal
structure in Hue

585
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,440
in here in the second row we have the
met said squared which is nonlinear

586
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,660
it is the source of Julia fractions our
dessert square

587
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:42,109
this is Ed on the 4th degree and this is
again that squared

588
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:45,500
arm so these are the type of

589
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,250
graph that perception is generating

590
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,569
you can you insert collar but

591
00:40:52,569 --> 00:40:56,799
these black-and-white images are
important from artistic standpoint

592
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:59,880
and are for analysis and

593
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,380
these this is our slightly different
case study he re

594
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:09,349
load a fixed image and transform its

595
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:13,160
weed out adding be arm

596
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,970
into changing come to urs in to opponent

597
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,259
collars and we apply different are

598
00:41:20,259 --> 00:41:24,339
bailout or bondra conditions so here we
have to limit circle

599
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:27,990
but in here but hear him limit to
rectangle

600
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:31,899
and a limit something else unlimited you
know again something else or some other

601
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,200
shapes are used as

602
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,740
limiter arm conditions are 22 generator

603
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:45,740
a the bailout matrix table

604
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,420
my comfort has been

605
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:53,510
slightly reduced here are home or

606
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,970
bid introduces Saudi arm

607
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:00,500
presentation so optimization
possibilities

608
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,050
are always look for experience people or
otherwise you will die

609
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:08,260
arm die alone

610
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,730
and you will never realize your our
dreams arm

611
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,950
look for program examples are go to
college

612
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:18,020
are take somebody else's homework

613
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,790
because if their room for the Michael
rule who was a student somewhere in the

614
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,590
USA

615
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:27,730
who had homework I would never learn are

616
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:31,280
about this sort of programming it gave
me

617
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,200
a reason to begin to work and the game
really meaning of life because I've been

618
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,270
our developer for a number reviews and I
know how to build

619
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:44,740
really interesting graphics applications
now because I started working

620
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:48,350
I began my work from with somebody's
homework

621
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:51,770
one better programming I have maybe are

622
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,900
100 gigabytes books and they're all

623
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,870
are mostly poor quality we cannot afford
them

624
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:03,450
so beware maybe you won't have enough
books this one is pretty good

625
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,609
our heritage shield it is available
first

626
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:11,420
sale in serbian Novi Sad arm use be
twice operations

627
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:15,740
RC hacker's delight it's a famous book
that uses the

628
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,640
exemplifies in C language how are you
optimizer

629
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,900
calculations such as multiplications
divisions

630
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,260
and such things it is extremely
complicated but

631
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,810
are so you have to use it as a reference
constantly and it

632
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:33,860
it is the same language used in CC plus
plus

633
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,450
and job on open CL

634
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,609
not Open GL but open CL is a new

635
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:43,890
technology for AMD graphics acceleration
so

636
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:46,970
harder acceleration is available in Java

637
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:50,410
Google for opera peep the

annual are and eat me a law or it may
not allow for

640
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:03,300
are speedups because basic yar is still
very fast but

641
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,240
if it does optimize something you may
get for example five times

642
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,810
greater our frame rate are job eight
long does

643
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:15,680
parallel processing are now available
and their home

644
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,990
I'm not so sure that they are on good
thing

645
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:23,390
and the new work stealing pool are
executors service the two bronze

646
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,940
different processes

647
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,740
and threads on CPU is available

648
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,859
are which I uses utilizes multi core
CPU's

649
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:37,100
are I will shoot two more things

650
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,600
I'll have to hurry up so you forgive me
how

651
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,500
will you learn to chaos theory are

652
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:48,400
well first of all complexity explore is
our

653
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,580
website it offers free courses from the

654
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:55,160
Santa Fe Institute you shoulda make sure
that you

655
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,750
apply for those courses their are

656
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,360
outs now you should the

657
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,260
perhaps try Kirsten fractal are

658
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:08,640
a book are there Chisholm berry berry

659
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,450
to very suitable for all ages are you
should the

660
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:18,040
look for some pirated books or else
there will be no books to read

661
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:22,440
book finder .org is the largest
underground

662
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,520
library arm for these purposes

663
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,430
so while they exist you should try to

664
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:33,720
study from them graphics programming
language processing

665
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,799
is very interesting in that law was
simulation environment so

666
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,290
are these lies will be made available to
you as later

667
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:45,020
are date our souls you will be able to

668
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,880
check all these things slowly are

669
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,900
I'm not going to leave this a four
screen

670
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,890
and I'm going to go back here been

671
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:03,890
going to try to explain to you what is
going on here

672
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:08,570
I have a direct connection to my desktop
computer

673
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:13,530
arm I cannot bring my desktop computer
it does not have a box

674
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:16,550
heats a source of really weird

675
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:21,040
and this is the development version of
perception on

676
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,110
are e-tron songs are a tinge are
eighties not available

677
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:29,500
on this desktop computer so we have to
run it on some more

678
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,690
advanced modern system otherwise its
looks exactly the same

679
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:38,190
in Linux barter my home latex would be
necessary

680
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:43,580
arm this is again I will repeat little
bit slow and

681
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,600
partly because its are its

682
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,150
through internets are broadcasting
system

683
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:53,630
called TeamViewer moms

684
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:57,460
so White Sea Doo be here here's some
kind

685
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:02,510
she Laura this thing Mike Fergus really
how to use

686
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,610
just kidding okay so this is the

687
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,770
deep the default perception

688
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:11,950
are this is the to the

689
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:16,330
the left side is the driver window which
can read live streams

690
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:20,080
and here we have options there are
perhaps a

691
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,370
I don't know how many options we we
spent

692
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:26,480
all the all the keys on the keyboard

693
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,060
and we're still adding all options so
they're really

694
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:34,450
are 10 so different options maybe maybe
up to 500 options

695
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:41,040
or more arm and

696
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,509
this this is the DDD dis signal that

697
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:49,190
as it is traveling through the internet
with some delays

698
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:52,740
it's preventing me to perhaps establish
the full control

699
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:56,229
but so arm anyhow you will have to

700
00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:00,830
download the release candidate version
from the source for Asian right on your

701
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:02,400
computer you you will need

702
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,210
the job aids are

703
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:11,200
Runtime Environment are

704
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,299
so I just want to make a brief resume

705
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,630
are what I told you today is that

706
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:23,290
we live in a new age people do not
believe anymore did

707
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:28,880
signs is deterministic ordered nature's
deterministic

708
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,140
nature is unpredictable and chaotic

709
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:36,999
chaos theory is going to be our presence
and future

710
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:41,069
you can try to study at the complexity
Explorer .org

711
00:48:41,069 --> 00:48:44,769
arm and deterministic systems

712
00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:48,249
are capable of producing your endless
variety

713
00:48:48,249 --> 00:48:53,069
novelty beauty and other amazing

714
00:48:53,069 --> 00:48:56,089
things that we see around

715
00:48:56,089 --> 00:48:59,430
its come chaos is the source

716
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:04,058
or novelty in beauty nature are here he
had the

717
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:07,430
program called perceptrons are

718
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:11,720
the which to displays video feedback

719
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:15,509
fractal they are both ordered and
disordered

720
00:49:15,509 --> 00:49:19,430
chaotic and beautiful so

721
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:23,368
if I may take your questions if any now

722
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:30,369
any questions

723
00:49:35,859 --> 00:49:42,859
in demand

724
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:47,540
yes

725
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:54,540
yes

726
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,140
are well you see

727
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,368
arm be RGB

728
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:07,829
art collar space

729
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:10,930
or collar strategy is in

730
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,328
in invention all are old

731
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:18,299
are intelligent brilliant in engineers

732
00:50:18,299 --> 00:50:21,690
Creuset machine programming assembler

733
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:24,950
see language and they knew

734
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:28,269
that the CPU works best when it's

735
00:50:28,269 --> 00:50:31,279
when it works with into june numbers

736
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:34,279
as are written

737
00:50:34,279 --> 00:50:37,740
in phnom binary format so

738
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,569
it's a bunch of zeros and ones 32

739
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:44,839
digits in total and the CPU

740
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:48,769
works best if it manipulates beats

741
00:50:48,769 --> 00:50:52,258
tell its to change a bit or two beats

742
00:50:52,259 --> 00:50:58,130
first beat last beach ten beats change
one's 20 stores ears to one's

743
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:02,049
it's meaningless you don't get anything
intelligent in that way

744
00:51:02,049 --> 00:51:05,440
but these aren't did technically
speaking

745
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,099
fastest operations that you can perform
on a computer

746
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:12,869
so in their best interest was

747
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:17,700
to define all mathematical operations
such as

748
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:22,269
meant no harm such as multiplication
division red ink

749
00:51:22,269 --> 00:51:25,549
thing else arm by using are

750
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:30,519
beats wise operations be because
operations and you need

751
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:34,269
those operations as well too are 22

752
00:51:34,269 --> 00:51:37,788
isolate de miedo third of an integer

753
00:51:37,789 --> 00:51:41,220
dole lost portion of the integer differs

754
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:44,459
portion of the engine 2g and bill on GYC

755
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:47,460
in the program are did d

756
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,690
the program itself the part of the
problem that works with

757
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,900
collars is completely unreadable

758
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,900
it is unspeakably complicated you naked
eye

759
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,210
are eat it basically has to come from
are

760
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:04,839
re experts so those basic graphics

761
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:06,330
operations

762
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:10,880
on collar using column and pixel
interpolation

763
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,310
pixels month Inc because pixels or
square

764
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:17,650
and if you have a chaos you have

765
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:21,660
squares that explodes into consequences

766
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:25,180
everything would be terrible if we can
add

767
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:28,839
square pixels so you have to use
interpolation

768
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,130
rounding soft tuning movie made you need
to

769
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:35,900
be an expert with the column and color
filters

770
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,460
or else you get explosion of chaos

771
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:44,050
are who look like a noise are

772
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:50,750
so arm a date they are fosston near
integers if using floating-point

773
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:54,480
our numbers they don't really exist

774
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,760
in a computer their concepts

775
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,730
dates needs to be are improved
algorithmically

776
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:06,790
so if you conceptualize all let's have
some gigantic numbers

777
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:10,070
no you don't have a room for gigantic
number you have a room for

778
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:14,550
64 digits in a 64 bits

779
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:19,540
process processor so it's a little bit
are different with the

780
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:22,680
other the integer numbers and you

781
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:26,930
are cannot use really the arm

782
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:30,919
the slow man in any way if you use

783
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:36,470
floating point numbers or anything else
I love this scenario

784
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:41,270
it becomes too slow but if you use this
scenario it is as fast as

785
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:44,600
C or C plus plus program so it's worth

786
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,610
while programming in jar

787
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:54,510
any anyone else something about

788
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:59,099
chaos about programming

789
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:02,980
something about been those

790
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:09,980
you drove a huge readers yes

791
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:33,730
kick you hear how do I handle what

792
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,669
are well here's the deal are in Java

793
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:40,110
there is no need for garbage collection
basically

794
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,490
garbage collector is some are kind of
our

795
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:46,709
process that runs on its own and you
never

796
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:50,860
use it we have for example Gras graphics
2d

797
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:55,300
object arm method called

798
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,950
dispose so if you have a graphics 2d
object

799
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:02,410
called object I

800
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:06,700
you type point dispose and you can

801
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,009
evoke it and use it and if you don't use
it

802
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:13,410
it still works so I'm not using it

803
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:17,879
I'm are sheeting you know I don't want
to execute

804
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,160
any are anything good that would slow it
down but

805
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,379
it does not slow it down you can call
this method

806
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:27,720
dispose on almost any object when you
need

807
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,230
it's disposed but no need to dispose of
anything

808
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:35,760
the anything during operation

809
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:42,760
it's all pretty pretty efficient

810
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:47,130
are yeah it's a very good question I

811
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:51,940
went to a job conversation where they
ask me this question

812
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:55,480
I was refused and perhaps I don't know

813
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:00,340
the answer to that question but I are
the only time I had problem

814
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:03,780
wooden the memory was when I designed
the

815
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,960
our preview the preview the image
preview

816
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,740
our method what is it when reloads

817
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:15,279
an external image I want is to bring up

818
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:21,050
a to bring up my heart disorder love
from

819
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:24,980
menu and to give me small icons
thumbnails

820
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:28,910
I are wrote my own thumbnail generator

821
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:32,759
and when it loads like a hundred images

822
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,350
their gigantic then

823
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:42,589
it would run into a memory problem but I
solved this by choosing the proper

824
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,650
kind of Q that are

825
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:49,020
doesn't allow a it

826
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:53,310
simulate a noose loading many image just
so you cannot

827
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:56,630
affords to load many hundreds

828
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:00,010
of images where each images

829
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:03,060
10 megabytes or more then

830
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:06,710
it will create a memory problem you have
to use

831
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:10,580
cues it's a topic are

832
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:13,830
of farm powerhouse how some images

833
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:17,020
sits and waits to be loaded instead of
being loaded

834
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:20,310
at at once so you record their names

835
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:24,580
or something in which foreign with 20
them

836
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:29,759
at the very last second when you need
them but otherwise all other images

837
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,160
on displays are very

838
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:37,930
very conservative are he we have plenty
of memory more

839
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:44,040
arm

840
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:51,040
yes anyone else

841
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:54,710
to do to them be

842
00:57:54,710 --> 00:58:00,910
record the

843
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:04,339
this

844
00:58:04,339 --> 00:58:05,150
time

845
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,200
the
