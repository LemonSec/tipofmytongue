1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:13,750
that

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:21,020
well West

3
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:28,020
air whatever care to hide

4
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,410
a hello I am cool from Zach herbs and

Gracia community

6
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,720
closer so here

7
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,720
up here said okay

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,839
a so I'm fiddler from croatia friends
are gonna

9
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,280
a member of a statement community for
cratia member of

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,140
Gration Linux so use a group and the for
a year now a member of focusing upon the

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,579
haitian

12
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,379
I am here to talk about all anti a
geographic information

13
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,539
and opposite map I'll well

14
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:08,320
redevelopment the development of more
than technologists like a

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,119
chip GPS devices a cheap some stuff like
that

16
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,240
the with high quality digital cameras so

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,259
I and the mobile phones we have a

18
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,050
only one device that can you the that
you can use the

19
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:28,380
to collected the geographic a few a
geographical information system and of

20
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,960
course

21
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,889
with the development the with the
development of mobile mobile broadband

22
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,340
you can do it a is continuously well

23
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,550
examples there are we cannot be up
opposite map Google Map Maker

24
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,020
a Nokia Maps a maker and stuff like that

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,509
are all in the efforts to the or getting
information

26
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:54,020
to create better maps well

27
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,190
one of my first a Milan have you can say
it wanted

28
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:03,770
a the GI shorten it a project was
supported participation in Panoramio

29
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,770
on the time you're I'll I guess

30
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,410
a lot of you know about Panoramio Google
service you take both the photos upload

31
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,160
them and that

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,890
the appear on the position so from that
you can collect

33
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,559
geographical information about that
position I

34
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,849
I is there are all these their house and
stuff like that I

35
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:27,140
and its I'll heath bar to Google
services so it's

36
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,569
a restricted the you its uses restricted

37
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,410
I it's reasonable Ian Holm browser
Sangam

38
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,980
and Google Art but the ap it looks like
this

39
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,200
this is the part what the love my
grandmother's religion

40
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,458
i'd took some pictures of I'll

41
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,010
well there is a open source outsource

42
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,798
alternative I'm up to are they started
the in general this year

43
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:56,090
and inmate their heads

44
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,200
about 500,000 pictures in

45
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,298
June they had a million pictures and now
they are

46
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:07,940
at the free in the quarter million
pictures so they got their exponentially

47
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,190
as

48
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,640
a their growth he says exponential I'll

49
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,200
when the didst when did it start to grow
exponentially

50
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,630
are indeed changed a license to up

51
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,930
a to the SEC bias BY SA

52
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,690
license then the opposite is my
community said okay

53
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,739
your license lol allows us to use those
both photos for our purposes

54
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:33,739
we'll start mapping ger a and the

55
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:38,660
I started also use my old phone I put
the CNN logo on it so I can use it

56
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,400
because a

57
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,340
they need Android four points something
and I

58
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,500
route to date the a flashed it and it
started working

59
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,900
nice in and in wild weekend I traveled
700 kilometres

60
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,519
and collected the 17 the Gigabyte the
photos

61
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,140
it's about 20,000 photos uploaded it

62
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,279
and the you can see the the region's

63
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,900
you can use the picture for for for free

64
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,070
and the and freely I'll

65
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,739
so I'm as I mentioned that the growth
was exponential

66
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,579
because of the opposite my purse and
they participate in opposite Matt

67
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,190
movement

68
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,500
because they have and a direct a options
to edited the date I'll

69
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,740
from there rip age I'll

70
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,620
what I want to do to say the nice thing
is that

71
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,200
that they have algorithms to major focus
or annual

72
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,700
travel a few times the same route

73
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,969
they match the the photos so you have a
wider area to see

74
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,390
wants you to go with the camera straight
to second

75
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,680
read the camera to the right 30 with the
camera to their left

76
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,500
and then when you zoom out you hell
something like bennett like panorama

77
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:51,910
view

78
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,510
it's not Google Street View rather have
a treat the free

79
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,330
360 degrees but it's moving along and
it's

80
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:04,580
a free this is the map it's not decided

81
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,810
I as you can see there are few routes

82
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,190
I mostly a from me and Milos

83
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,450
though you place it

84
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,450
you can do it you can do it if a if you
modes you can you

85
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,700
use it on the bike you can use by hence
on YouTube or you can use it

86
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,849
in the car a their I here's the

87
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,810
the naughty side university campus I did
at the by walking

88
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,250
and the rest this done by up sticking on
a cell phone

89
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:39,620
on other call it

90
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,880
that suck up got a couch then you place
a forty-two unit

91
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,490
I forgot the a do you have for holder on
the on the windshield

92
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,449
start to court city to 160 or 26 seconds
interval and

93
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:56,900
take pictures and drive I this is what
the what they said

94
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,969
I there are few Center photos 01

95
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,940
photo to the right and one foot to the
left and his own out you have something

96
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,760
like panorama

97
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,409
and when you have more photos you have
amorphous panorama and

98
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,310
it's free to use I the other stuff

99
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,820
a wreaking law get together on tiered
information

100
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,479
the social networks for squares Twitter
Facebook Google+

101
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,930
et cetera et cetera our allies location
sharing

102
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,400
people visit some places and take I was
here

103
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,840
REITs them and take a picture later

104
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,070
you can put it brought as those pictures
and get information

105
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,030
deformation about those location from
those photos are

106
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,650
so YouTube tag location and you take
photo RAM

107
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,409
there's an information i'm talking here
about

108
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,810
volunteered information that too that
the

109
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,380
the stuff that an essay and cool in my
other stuff people though

110
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,330
i gather I

111
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,340
or information without your permission
that's

112
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,409
other stuff this is clearly all freely

113
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:03,169
submit that information there's also

114
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:06,229
there was also talk about the automatic
bar sink

115
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:09,770
of for location-based this content I'll

116
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,080
when your cash take something on Twitter
and said the foetal

117
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,900
and also photos go tagged you can
process although all the cash thanks and

118
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,090
gather all the photos

119
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,400
all the location in full and the a
creator hot spots and the

120
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,000
stuff like that still know what's going
on on the negative side

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,280
as you can see I this is

122
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,409
photo from suffers from some other
enough to come I'll read it

123
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:39,229
back to people not stupid geotech their
photos because

124
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:42,530
over the poachers I you take a photo

125
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,090
its get tagged somebody you upload it on
the net

126
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,830
somebody who is interested in black
rhino and elephant or something like

127
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,289
that

128
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:53,310
they know there's ru their the

129
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,740
photos were taken the me great migration
the

130
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,080
that serve the animals which are in
danger and they

131
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,130
comes with them Sol there's the negative
side of of

132
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,409
this one of the negative side the butts
but I have these pictures are used

133
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,560
I there's another principal there's
another

134
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,810
stuff you can do this is supersede

135
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,150
translated a stone by Wall I

136
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,370
this is a project for my colleague in
the University of Zagreb

137
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,530
I'll the use its to collect all the data
about

138
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,609
old a walls old buildings

139
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,219
anything that is done with stone drywall
a

140
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,990
and it looks like this you can collect
the data you can submit the data

141
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,940
and gets the information about cultural
heritage a

142
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,990
wheat the old stone mason techniques

143
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,130
and you can also be to apply pictures
and stuff like that

144
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,089
I okay this is %uh partners for

145
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:57,370
presentation a

146
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,290
their is either berries a portal called
my eyes are grabbed

147
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,980
do it the most talkative the it is so

148
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,589
from how the Colts

149
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,820
public services created it so they can
gather information about

150
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,709
where are the Kohls on on the road so
where is the

151
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:19,800
a broken fire hydrant the anything like
that

152
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,069
but there was a discussion on the net to
be about the price of the project

153
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:29,979
and the techniques used on its it was so
closed source and use the

154
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,749
mmm the from say that night or something
like that

155
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:38,149
but a it's also requires

156
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:41,779
a herridge say registration that is
necessary

157
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:44,779
and their public services that

158
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:47,800
reply on those reports so you're you
reap

159
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,069
you reported there is a hole in in the
rolled

160
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:56,459
public service rolled the maintainance
they goal check it out fill it up and

161
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:00,989
reported this affixed in what time

162
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,499
I don't know they are not so I'll Ste

163
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:07,569
past a and it looks like this

164
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:10,819
not so a pretty sight I'll

165
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,969
also there is a open source alternative
that uses

166
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,860
a was a kid deployment digits anonymous
reports

167
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,059
and it'd the diplomat informant open Fri
11 standards

168
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:26,279
I heard about it I didn't explore about
me

169
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,930
so much about it but public services are
not

170
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,378
a obligated to reports to those

171
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:37,970
reports and this is how the site looks
you can click report

172
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,129
the him I'll complete copy of might with
the street

173
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:45,209
a mile it's a about it there is the

174
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:49,250
for now there is no corporation as far
as I know

175
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,569
I there is also fix my street project

176
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:57,920
and the organization test mice I i mean
organization is my society I met the guy

177
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,740
means October Chris part of the team and
she talked to

178
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,939
about that it's a similar pic principal

179
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:08,519
you report to the something that is
wrong in your neighborhood the European

180
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,670
your state annual

181
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:15,209
get people to Google to react there is
also

182
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:16,589
one other stuff

183
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,830
to one of the other things this a green
cleanup the lease on the cheese Cup

184
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:25,880
I it was a part of the world cleanup
2013 efforts

185
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,070
value rock I went out and searched for

186
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,150
illegal garbage dumps so

187
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,840
you have a map you have a I

188
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,440
types of got pretty disposals

189
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,450
a and your report everything that these
that you're trying to find a tiring the

190
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,100
wards

191
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,880
you report it to find up place where a
garbage that the Trump

192
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,820
garbage truck illegally dumped its waste
to report that so

193
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,880
in the efforts there as you can see in
as you can see in the background

194
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,100
there are a lot of reports I of

195
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,590
I can fuck I can't find the site anymore

196
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,620
I think they switched the the

197
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,920
open maybe I didn't try too much but
maybe they switched it will reflect the

198
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,319
or it

199
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,460
or it was offline but when I look for it
but it was a into data ©2013

200
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,260
but it it used disc the it made its
purpose

201
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,480
I'll happen this is a nice stuff

202
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,620
our colleague of mine started project

203
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,220
a record the comment ily

204
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,420
a was like a comedy I'll

205
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,120
the there is a a growing number of
security surveillance camera

206
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,170
traffic cameras and stuff like that but
there is no database to collect them all

207
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,900
so hit he came to the a let's stick

208
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,040
all the photos of all the comatose and
ski started

209
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,699
the I don't have a web

210
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,840
I the screenshots because

211
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,010
I didn't have time to go to contact him
to the

212
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,069
tools sending the link but because
divorce

213
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:11,300
are other stuff it was a project in
start-up but you know he is

214
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,689
got a lot of comatose on the record and
these days her recording us all as the

215
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,470
record them

216
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:22,060
I'll you I'll try to get more
information for the

217
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,829
later for the later times but it's a

218
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,710
a nice effort let's return to measure a

219
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:34,110
let's return with the same measure I'll
one of the main things

220
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,100
I the GI is good for is humanitarian
response

221
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,680
I'll maybe I don't know it

222
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,910
most of you know about the floods that
happen and Southeast Europe though

223
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,010
dismay it was I in serbia

224
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:53,939
bosnia creche up and it was I'll

225
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,120
large I'll there're

226
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,680
sure platforms I people in the

227
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,780
serbia I'll or created a

228
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,560
will secure the deployment for reacting

229
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,060
a there was no organized the

230
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,140
brought there was no organized

231
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,800
effort from the government either
countries

232
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,540
the to inform the people to organize
people

233
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,689
so it was all up to them I in

234
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:30,760
in serbia they created problems lettuce
with bush to hear the deployment for

235
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,330
reporting

236
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,440
and for you in I and do it work what
press for

237
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,549
I'll other stuff

238
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,739
the head this is summer they had the

239
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:46,199
almost 3,000 reports the head

240
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:50,309
1.5 million visitors in one month and
simultaneously

241
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:53,618
are hundreds of 1600

242
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:58,869
visitors on the site a the guys in
bosnia created multiple block

243
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:03,359
are also on Wilshire heady and they had
a a to hunt

244
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:06,669
280 reporting first few days

245
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:11,409
ago I gots the a database down from the

246
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:15,369
those go to her from the both sides abut

247
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:18,989
the people from serbia kept updated me
with new

248
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:22,449
the tub is numb so I'd good get older
they talk

249
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:25,988
but people in bosnia they were more busy

250
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:29,279
so I got only the first to adopt nothing
else

251
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,129
I also there was popular EU deployment
for

252
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:36,209
I think it was also called for bosnia
but

253
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:40,238
the try together all the time and then
gray sharp

254
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:44,399
I try to the I tried tool deploy or so
he did

255
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,449
but they didn't want it they didn't want
it they didn't know how to

256
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:51,488
it was too much for them so they only
did workplace at nevermind

257
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:55,989
they did a did something I

258
00:15:55,989 --> 00:16:00,479
what what was so the information
gathering methods a social networks are

259
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:04,619
SA said the there were two liter
Facebook Google stuff like that where

260
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:06,649
people reported they are saw them I

261
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:09,660
my grandparents I'm trapped in the

262
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,399
in this city in this a street in this
bill building you somebody help them and

263
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,589
there was a lot of them

264
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:19,120
and also read your matures there we have
a

265
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,380
one participant of the efforts I'll
thank you

266
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,439
a I

267
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,240
I'll talk to you later i'm for the for
everybody so you can

268
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,760
textin feel it and fill in the gaps are
so there were also hit the

269
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,399
portals for both our country said there
was a local knowledge for people they

270
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,029
arm

271
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:44,610
then all the area this is the version of

272
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,700
serbian deployment a

273
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,890
or K I took a screenshot

274
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:56,370
in a in the period today were migrating
from the server send them guy cool for

275
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,130
deployed it

276
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,950
a set up it OpenStreetMap but the the
guy who did the

277
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,540
migration didn't know how to set up
opposite Metro can set up Google

278
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,280
I took a risk in shutting that moments
and it came back this reached the

279
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,139
of 410 backhand a mail it was on
opposite map

280
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,540
a big on so the people who work in the
edit then

281
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,599
report locations about this is how it
looks

282
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,800
a I I fold the portal oh those

283
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,500
of weeks and it was so a little

284
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,580
scary to see people report so

285
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,059
my grandparents are in the at the CAW
all that

286
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:38,750
building there are defense hero and
stuff like that it was sad to see

287
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,370
a this was so

288
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,570
Boston deployment and these are those

289
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,780
280 reports a

290
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,899
and stuff like this this is Saul Saul

291
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,480
information you see his father did you
see

292
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,530
that animals these are the

293
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:04,060
these are some of the information is
that we're gathered on those portals

294
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:08,060
I after the initial floods so few weeks
after that

295
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,360
the after it settled a we gots

296
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,889
I use those the tube is Dom's filtered
the ports and

297
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,140
this is a heat map all the reports

298
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,830
where there are floods are where they
are a

299
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,300
damaged roads a building seen the

300
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,409
bad shape this stuff like that and you
can see

301
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,260
from sorry that they are

302
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,280
a lot reports I'll

303
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,070
let's see how yet finally the guys in
gray shut the the map

304
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,159
but they had to manually enter

305
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,160
all the information out there was an
automatic process so you can enter it

306
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,190
but just have to see

307
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:51,030
had dissented them information they had
to process it and uploaded them

308
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,710
but they did something a

309
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:58,560
after that after the initial a startled
us

310
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,139
was a key part for us they were using
OpenStreetMap maps

311
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,490
as a big round toe report but

312
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,970
I in some of those areas the maps a were

313
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,140
almost tempted I because know what the

314
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,050
nobody a was from there and nobody had
interest

315
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,430
in the drawing those areas so I

316
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:24,880
in a in corporate the incorporation with
the communitarian OpenStreetMap team

317
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,500
I'll restarted I'll

318
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,239
from mapping action and the humanitarian
deployment

319
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:36,129
literate rights together all the people
and not all the people but people from

320
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:37,259
all over the world

321
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,950
to help mapped I'll those a full
affected areas

322
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,600
who had the from

323
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,969
various sources who gets a we got or
where are the areas

324
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,320
that are infected up but our hop
endangered

325
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,320
so to say and the created

326
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,960
a task a which had to be mapped as you
can see it

327
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,539
it covered are it covered something like

328
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:07,269
13,000 kilometers a square kilometers

329
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:12,769
meters of serbia are around damn

330
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:15,919
or 2012 a hundred

331
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,590
went well thousands thousands are
thousand kilometers square

332
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,649
in bosnia and about 2,000 gray shop

333
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:28,498
a the turf that were affected but we
created a task that the

334
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:31,970
cads 29,000 thousand square kilometers

335
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,559
we had to map soul people started my pic

336
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:41,049
there are some pretty pissed
participants here I

337
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:45,359
and people started to map they had the
area they logged in

338
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,439
to the opposite mapper up to the test
server they selected a square

339
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,820
it was around a kilometer per kilometre
each square

340
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:58,820
no no sorry

341
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,460
now it was ten by ten kilometers quit
something like that it was our

342
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,889
sup everybody had a lot large square
tool

343
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:10,340
map and people started mapping are
firstly

344
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,988
their world a britt priority areas
soviet

345
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:17,100
which were which had to be met first
because

346
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,449
Deborah flood waves coming to those
cities so

347
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,279
it was are dynamic and a lot of work was

those portals that had people on a
reports of over the net so

448
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,950
I I will I'm doing OpenStreetMap since
2009

449
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,610
I know spatial data I don't know a local
though

450
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:29,580
areas I don't know where it is that you
flooded the area where the real

451
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,730
girl about the role does are broken so

452
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:38,050
I had people tell me where where the
troubles and restarted my pink soul

453
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,240
I can at least have help it that way
Dale

454
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,160
they will have all the map school for
later that's the way it's

455
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,950
I could help in that a area a

456
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:52,660
also about the colleague of mine is
doing

457
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,650
and from is it too Bhd

458
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,740
yep I idea and he's

459
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,490
analyzing a special date top from cult
source

460
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:07,100
and the it's interesting

461
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,709
I am NOT is so interesting in this lied
about the when you know more information

462
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,760
I

463
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,570
we have authority they talk like a real
real estate investor

464
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,939
like up Bob liquor services

465
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,460
like a road so although administered in

466
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,410
authorities have all own set so they
thought and the

467
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:31,970
the colleague did the PhD comparing
those

468
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,170
date to girl so they don't

469
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:39,400
and he came to the conclusion that

470
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,880
always time the date that gets more and
more accurate

471
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,050
ends gets more and more information and

472
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,080
a shares more information to store

473
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,220
then the authority data a going to take
a look at it

474
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,480
a when you look at the sitemap it has

475
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,570
a complete history it has and author

476
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,330
it has every change

477
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:08,189
from the start the current date and when
you look

478
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:11,610
I'm going to had to say

479
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:16,340
I talk bad about my

480
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,909
feel that work because when US look at
the real estate a decir and stuff like

481
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,850
that when the girl

482
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,889
what were they have a official records
this your balls

483
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,630
or so this is your calls this your piece
of land you don't know anybody

484
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,820
anything about the person who measure
that who did that

485
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,460
when you look at it like look at
OpenStreetMap you have a record

486
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,790
a could draw it could read who edited it

487
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:45,490
when and you have a comment lie in
stopping

488
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,650
stuff like that for each source is a
terror GPS data is a

489
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:53,750
the is it satellite imagery is its
public girl

490
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,180
image juries at local village everything
like that and you can enter more

491
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,920
information in its then you know

492
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,200
official records a

493
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,390
about the history increase so we have a
one-point

494
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,630
that his I

495
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:14,090
a history that has 270 280 revisions

496
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:18,429
I when you look at it so somebody edited
at the same point

497
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,950
over 200 times and refined I'll be fine

498
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:25,280
I found out why because it is the the is
the point

499
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,629
on the map which represent represented
the

500
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,710
Republic operation saw every time

501
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:34,860
somebody added they're all language for
cratia

502
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,580
the edited the

503
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,550
the the point so hit me here the whole
complete

504
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,379
history a that's the

505
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,480
additional data that is not stored in
the official in proprietary data

506
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,620
a there are new york new measurements
for a quote to date

507
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,020
for the quality update up a let's say

508
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,620
up you want to get the data

509
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,760
but I want to filter all the buildings

510
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,470
did star a which acres which have
secrecy

511
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,730
or oath a of block the plus/minus

512
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:13,470
10 meters you can get I'll also the
datum you can filter out the date

513
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:17,300
you could do that analysis and stuff
like that there are also

514
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,600
integration efforts with her integration
with existing starter

515
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,280
standards OJSC and stuff like that and

516
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,090
integration with authority date up which
rejects these

517
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,550
which exists today and you can do
comparisons

518
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,110
a in UK I think they they are

519
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:39,719
I working together with the

520
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,020
few public or services about bus lines
and stuff like that

521
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:48,120
I'll where they can edit a people in
opposite matt gets

522
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,459
official data look at it edit it and
return it back

523
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,420
and of course headed in opposite map so
that there is a corporate corporate

524
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,580
corporation a

525
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:04,770
us like to see ok at nine month a

526
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,658
wait a minute a

527
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:10,919

528
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,059
if you have apart a if you have
questions about this part

529
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,700
I'll ask now I'll in a minute or so

530
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,390
I'll switch to a real real time
demonstration and more examples

531
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:27,080
all the data so about this part any
questions

532
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,658
okay a

533
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:35,309
and now about opposite map more

534
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:38,379
I does anybody here

535
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,039
a who knows about the opposite may
appear rule

536
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,250
nice to hear a who uses it who
contributes

537
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:52,140
Noize yeah few people

538
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,440
a better than the last 200 been in there
had better and then look in the last

539
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,030
conference

540
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:01,668
a so open sitemap

541
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:05,909
I'll you know how it hard to started I
don't have to say that

542
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:08,929
but a did you know that

543
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,990
a thats this map is not

544
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:16,739
everything there is a lot more so you
have a map you have a vector data

545
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,830
you have a vector data in real time you
can use

546
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:23,529
a do know it has a free the option

547
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,780
well

548
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,780
let's loaded and look at more South

549
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,290
re are okay

550
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:40,350
my PC is a little slow at

551
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:44,129
you can see loading and the

552
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,668
this information is from few seconds

553
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,649
to they are so old a

554
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:55,350
so your edits a height of a building he
read it the

555
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:58,770
building shape you can get it in 3d

556
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,460
okay up

557
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,280
usually here is a

558
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,620
irritation pan and stuff like that but a

559
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,859
this laptop is seven or eight years old
so

560
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:18,600
its it uses I use it for stock
presentations

561
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,690
this is too much for him a it

562
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,820
sorry no

563
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,400
so this is

564
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,820
a open Feb GL it sends the data to the

565
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:39,180
browser browser so that browser renders
its on home PC this this runs like a

566
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,419
rello the machine I and refillable

567
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,610
something bad they started on it works

568
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,800
trust me it works not on this mission
this is another

569
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,020
example of free the her two-and-a-half
the

570
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,620
if you want to say a when you zoom out

571
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,200
so mean and its I need to find the tall
building

572
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,180
a kid a slow slow slow slow

573
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,850
and it still slow

574
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,930
I know here

575
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:17,529
cure song told the building's just let
me so mean a

576
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:22,170
weiss et or two-and-a-half the because
when you look when you know

577
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,740
pan left and right you see the building
school Inc

578
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,859
like in a real you from

579
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,040
nice stuff

580
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,820
and the database also fuel sickens me
nance

581
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,550
our sold a the stuff I said about

582
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:46,290
my pillory a 20

583
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,440
people people are our oath met think
more and more

584
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,400
a the the let me so mean to

585
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,920
the stuff I said about

586
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:04,920
getting no known

587
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:11,370
Rum Point you see a checkpoint on the
side

588
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:16,390
both ran I K

589
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:23,390
on position

590
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,160
ok it that's what they said you zone out
and you get the

591
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,859
picture overlap fantasy something like

592
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:34,650
a panoramic you not completely both

593
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:39,200
are if you travel a 10-time saying the
same routes and collect the data

594
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,859
and I on the road back you also do that

595
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:45,910
you can although gets 360 almost

596
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:51,989
but what

597
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:57,030
yes this is croat source

598
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,960
I

599
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,660
I because the use a they have a pop

600
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,770
let's go I asked them to come to

601
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:11,030
balkan about the conference but they
said

602
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:15,760
a they're busy in this period's they
asked me can you talk about it for a

603
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,710
second okay I'll talk about the first
for 30 seconds

604
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:22,510
so it's girl stock source kelso threat
level photos

605
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:27,560
ahead there is a Andriy there is an app
from

606
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,750
for a hundred for iPhone for me for a
blunder them

607
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:36,130
because the throughway San I don't know
how school

608
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,090
there is an app you started it the stars
GPS

609
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:44,400
you have to hit you have to have
accuracy under 15 meters

610
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,740
for it to start recording and a

611
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,080
those are questionable photos but those

612
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,640
under about 10 meters are accepted that
would not pursue trouble

613
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,170
so you go collect pictures they are you
up a lil there is

614
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,119
a each because unique you

615
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:07,170
you you idea and each sequence his
unique your the

616
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,190
so you get a sequence and the

617
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,359
sick list for those each foot because a
his it up his East

618
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:17,509
its ha sorry as its ID each see

619
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,859
from and from the C Class your you can
against the

620
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:25,910
orientation from the photo at the time
the accuracy the precision

621
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,319
and stuff like that ATC Noel if York's

622
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,490
open the exit tag you can see the
picture has its own

623
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:38,029
data and a a gets did that did they took
position the pictures

624
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,869
and later the they use up be trickle

625
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:46,400
correlation to find corresponding up
points in pictures

626
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,390
yep them so they both first you have to
be

627
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,710
have to have up it correctly positioned
or invaded

628
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:57,320
so they can process it further are you
upload the pictures

Artemis atomic the service and wit and
where

713
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:48,150
a each images are present the way you
you have images of our 250

714
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:52,049
six pixels each and open whatever map

715
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:55,930
uses a I random algorithm

716
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,990
to a loads each square

717
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:03,269
from a different source so you can see
how many sources they are

718
00:46:03,269 --> 00:46:06,660
well and it is amazing how to get the
girl

719
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:11,538
crazy map a you follow the road and it
switches from black and white stool free

720
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:12,099
the

721
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:15,660
to I'll and

722
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,810
a standard a

723
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:20,700
met Nick 20 per cycle may have to open
topo map

724
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,618
%uh there is a lot of stuff a

725
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:28,290

727
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:37,910
thoughtful month so

728
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:42,520
example for topographic map a

729
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,950
good

730
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:48,390
people who are trying to a

731
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:52,558
people who are going on on the hikes and
stuff like that they asked can we get

732
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,160
my pool half of all from the mountains
and stuff like that

733
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,450
%uh the way we used its like in
topographic maps wanna on the

734
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:04,519
to twenty-five hundred thousand yeah you
can get that you can get this

735
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:08,169
this map online and you can also also
get it offline

736
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:11,170
some I'll

737
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:18,170
yeah

738
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,870
a you can the

739
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:25,750
her you can set it 'as a big round in a
few applications and you can cash it

740
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:30,100
so heavily the cashing in the background
you can use it online

741
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,560
I open Topol I don't know if you if you
do you think if you didn't you can't

742
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,120
download

743
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,240
I want this region to take it made

744
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,310
take it with me but there are so few

745
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:45,380
a mobile phone applications that a lot
allow you to download

746
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:50,380
Victor maps year

747
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,670
I particular for this initial beer

748
00:47:53,670 --> 00:48:00,670
I'll mmm had to say a climate add this
to the commercial 441 at

749
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,899
it has a paid version but its open
source

750
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,010
and you can use the cold then you can
compile it yourself or you can download

751
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,300
the nightly version

752
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,880
which is full version and you can you to
get its phone from if droid

753
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,840
which is open source and you can there
are a lot of sources UK

754
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,050
you can get it I use Poisson aunt

755
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,760
I participated in the development though

756
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:28,130
about the in the spatial the special
though part of the development

757
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,520
I'll add them to the program and I help
them with two areas to download and

758
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,410
stuff like that

759
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,710
a.m. to generate maps and stuff other
stuff like that

760
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,960
a you get the app download it the

761
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,550
slow with the second or sand

762
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:46,600
through your you more you

763
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,910
you search for or some aunt a nightly
build

764
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:53,620
and let's see if my network connection
works

765
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:57,240
and you get the or some on my plea

766
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:01,240
opera cool down all the time starts to
it's free but it's not official from

767
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:01,819
Google Play

768
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:05,350
not it works I and your bet the tester

769
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,430
for applications so it just get
something but that doesn't work you can

770
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:10,129
report it

771
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:13,960
I'll Europe up doesn't work and their
site doesn't work

772
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,310
I use it i'd a every route we'll tell
you can download regions

773
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:24,779
they'd regenerate every 10 days so every
10 days you have a new map

774
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,250
anything that is entering OpenStreetMap
in in there

775
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:32,160
appear this ten-day cease on that map a

776
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,370
I use it a I use its

777
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:39,640
for not so much navigation but for
editing

778
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,549
there is a you have to activate the
plugin or some editing and then

779
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:47,310
you can directly enter points from your
mobile phone

780
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:51,340
to the map and the box

781
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,620
you can't see them on the map until you
get the updates in those 10 days

782
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,990
I but you can also markle

783
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:03,620
bogs I'll on part on it's not box
anymore it's opposite left notes

784
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:10,620
saw you added on from is the network

785
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:14,140
I the network akin

786
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:18,490

I but I was trying so hard that

788
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,839

will I'll any more questions

793
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:47,810
I can show anything more because I need
connection to the Internet

794
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:52,549
but okay the I can show you on the phone
later

795
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,720
how it looks a if you get

796
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,189
I there is a plugin for awesome on which
you have to pay

797
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:02,250
and then you have are a

798
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:06,040
you can on your phone you can download
contours and you have a 3d map

799
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,370
I'll the normal version on the has

800
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:13,569
to the map but with the go that bait
liking

801
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:17,130
if you want you don't have to but a you
can get

802
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:21,349
previews a and the UC a shading

803
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:24,950
contours and it's fun abuts

804
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:29,368
the here that piece of software said me

805
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:32,630
when we were in England because a

806
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:36,420
a friend of mine went to a neighboring
country

807
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,660
what cool

808
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:45,589
that's it

809
00:51:45,589 --> 00:51:49,460
day a night we up occur and it works on
your phone

810
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,790
you just have to disable a a

811
00:51:53,790 --> 00:52:00,220
safe publication or something but like
that then good

812
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:04,200
a ever droid version is done by

813
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:11,200
call another other crew their droids

814
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:14,790
yeah I think this one holds a house that
has a deal because

815
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:20,370
only on or Sam on a Google Play you have
a virgin's 15 16 17

816
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:23,390
a nightly case the old up

817
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,830
a Knightley has also kissed the old

818
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:29,980
and Android also distilled I think so

819
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,390
I'll ever droid the diff the difference
between

820
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:37,490
this and they've droid this is done by
the list among cruel

821
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:41,430
a degenerated daily nightly and they've
dried

822
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:44,740
the a someone who dis %uh decided to
port it

823
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:47,959
but not support its to compile it

824
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,000
it is the distributed as he

825
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,150
guest time to download the norse new
source code compile it and upload it

826
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:55,800
with the right

827
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,280
%uh nightlies new or

828
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,760
but may be back here ever own a
diversion offend

829
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,620
employed I think it uses a air

830
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:11,230
I think that if do it uses a stable
versions not

831
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:15,190
not tightly versions I think it's and
stuff like that I used to use the

832
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:15,750
versace of

833
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:19,720
on that droid I use this I tested free
version I tested

834
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,500
it works the same yet

835
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,360
the friend went to neighboring country
only ten kilometers

836
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,400
across the border he lost the

837
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,400
she's a

838
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,990
chrome network and he connected to the
net that to the local network

839
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:42,100
he had less a month but he didn't
download the the country

840
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,430
i said im exiting the day before a stall
them

841
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:50,379
a creche on the a status is called him
the application and said if you ever go

842
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:54,280
to another country download the country
well yeah a little earlier if he went

843
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,100
outside

844
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:59,230
/url know them how to get there I feel I
have that application

845
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:02,360
I don't have the map I'll use the

846
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:06,740
hill in a beloved dot the roaming should
use Google Maps in thought and that the

847
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:07,189
roaming

848
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:11,730
I i think is she cared a

849
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:15,240
she used it for a few minutes and she
got

850
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:19,250
I'll 120 euros I'll any he is a

851
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:22,270
I'll live showed a higher limits

852
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:25,880
and he she got around 250 euros

853
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,010
artists so

854
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:34,820
she learned don't use got the wrong that
was so

855
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:38,829
before I the new doctor roaming

856
00:54:38,829 --> 00:54:42,079
stuff is something like that but this
helps

857
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,170
a a kid

858
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:48,530

861
00:55:05,109 --> 00:55:08,380
I I saw somebody did the

862
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:12,840

863
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:19,840
the the said

864
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:25,819
us and are all there there's enough
another's to another think

865
00:55:25,819 --> 00:55:29,680

map

866
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:34,950
of UK in Minecraft the use the
OpenStreetMap

867
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:39,629
and dress for me it's to my craft and
you can download it it's around

868
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:43,029
to get gigs gigabytes

869
00:55:43,029 --> 00:55:46,180
condoled a starting minecraft

870
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:49,500

there is a map of England UK in
Minecraft format

873
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:02,240

I'll post it met this evolving community
animal

903
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,370
evolving product there's also I forgot
to a

904
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:06,470
open source routing machine that uses
opposite maybe they thought

905
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:10,089
a digit did anyone try to connect

906
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:15,830
a a how does however

907
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:18,259
keep a good horny in the South Africa

908
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:21,740
to not come their routing

909
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:25,618
is gone under a second a Gibraltar

910
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:29,700
to what they were stuck routing is that
done under a second and when you move

911
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:33,770
a the roots it's also a single tickets

912
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:37,690
a if the tenuously changes to root so

913
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:41,700
powerful borrowed open source and open
date I he's

914
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:46,640
expanding in great a ok if that was the
picture

915
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:51,220
a I don't want to bother you anymore
