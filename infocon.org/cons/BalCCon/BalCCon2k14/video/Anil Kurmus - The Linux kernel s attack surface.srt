1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,420
that

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,030
the

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:21,020
well West

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:28,020
air whatever care to hide

5
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,540
its with

6
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,530
delivery will first and foremost I would
like to thank the organizers

7
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,629
straight conference in the beautiful
city that

8
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,670
Islamist other a I'll be talking about
what they performed in the past four

9
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,420
years

10
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,180
therefore I will be is certainly not
going too much into the details

11
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,989
however trial presentation all the
references

12
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,070
to publications were you can find more
details a lot of course you're always

13
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,350
welcome to us

14
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,580
questions up to people all

15
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,229
so I will like to start with a great
good

16
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:14,710
from the russian folklore if you don't
have it though

17
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,360
your neighbor coord a

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,190
so it may seem funny but after all

19
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,450
it's a simple and effective way or

20
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,570
reducing your taxes so what does that
have to do with the Linux kernel

21
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,750
well this girl is very much like this

22
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,920
Swiss Army joins trees are like it is
very teachable

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,979
it does anything that would hurt me but
that also means the

24
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:45,209
as many things but we'll never really
need

25
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:48,209
what substances the RBS for the whole

26
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:52,780
reliable that the ground surface as far
as I know this is used only by

27
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,539
lost your Oracle Database however does
in the mainline kernel

28
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:01,099
though all the rain exile also does

29
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:04,259
I'll the performance framework those
other useful

30
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,899
framework for all for holtzman
journalist Carl

31
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:11,180
I'll however you might not need I'll

32
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:18,000
in your production environment similarly
there is another the debugging interface

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,070
popular development which you might know
all

34
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,150
the same thing goes for double wall
might not need to know

35
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,890
production environment there's also
built the bucket filters which allow you

36
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,559
to do

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,920
'em others performance back at the three
within the neutral 0

38
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,440
a similar there are cases where you will
need the

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,370
including owns the even for looking and
moments

40
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,830
however it does not like this store is
something you

41
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,280
always needs to those something that you
would be interested

42
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,830
to you remain from the girl with the
Asian

43
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,450
there is a mentioning all this a

44
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:01,320
is of course as many of you know
although in those features Hulsey

45
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,470
know that is in the past which publicly
available exploitable its toll

46
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,760
so what the like

47
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,350
all there is hope to learn those
features are you can do

48
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,070
actually something very simple is just
think your favorite web search engine

49
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,280
and to look for the the the thing that

50
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,680
your interest forces lives on useful
there you can see that

51
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,590
pretty much all the results apart from
that we could be a result there

52
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,690
is not explaining Lord yes is doing at
all

53
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,840
but rather explains the exploits of so
that's an interesting thing

54
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,440
by itself the the US will result with
all

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,620
other features as wall but all that is
nice

56
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,049
again the other day you want to say that
there's a larger picture

57
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:54,350
as for no reason but with clearly
defined what that means but Alexis

58
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,560
or larger Texas so that's is certain the
first

59
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,720
question the address

60
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,940
it is is it possible precisely the final
the car looks at this

61
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,430
and then measure it once we do that

62
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,390
injure the look Journal protection
mechanisms

63
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,668
whose I suppose reduction little
quantifiable so we will be able to

64
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:18,779
measure it and say

65
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,359
all this %uh that much reduction if we
were treated that way

66
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,710
we will reach this works with

67
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,049
action and of course we will this to be
practical

68
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,990
just heard people's hopeful play this
you stroll practice

69
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,080
so in this store it will be tripled

70
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,280
first or the vote the pontiff occasional

71
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,909
all the was published and this is the OC

72
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,330
13 second or is the ultimate the

73
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,419
with that love Bowl to

74
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:50,549
cater withdrawal that the

75
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,419
response to the features that you
exactly third or

76
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:59,070
is doing this this is the say but we
both need to recompile the car

77
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,409
alright

78
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,560
for the first part all will talk about
measuring the car what that surface

79
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,840
first you need to be fine with the
alexis is so

80
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,750
quickly in over two systems research to
keep people will talk about easy

81
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,780
trusted computing base and measured it
easy service

82
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,650
in terms of local without lawful means
people will go

83
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,198
into the source code repository run

84
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,070
tools that assist local to measure old
number of lines of voters in the

85
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,800
repository

86
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,270
they will say places but the just to
Michael Carroll us

87
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,409
15 the lines of code but the next three
has foretell lines of code

88
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:43,099
and their for this point here

89
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:46,800
because when you compare it to limits
people who just turned me love

90
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,469
thought those really orders of magnitude
of difference but now we're interested

91
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:53,110
in the list although it's all

92
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,740
a new limits for all we want to be very
careful about how we measure

93
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,150
loyal furnaces whether both source file

94
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,448
are never well store there are many of
those people store

95
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,460
corporation the band total

96
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,930
told what the ball Lulu Carlos

97
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,770
I'll code that and you know that from
though

98
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,969
but they usually automatically all the
mile love one another or use a

99
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:27,790
requests with both both that is not even
reachable from the system call interface

100
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,010
for example you might have a

101
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,670
the flow flow in the boot Co

102
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,700
let's say when parsing the kernel

103
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,229
the initialization parameters however

104
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,270
that doesn't necessarily mother because
if you're there is in the electoral

105
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,960
old girl who shows vision for meters
Hiyori have

106
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,669
focal local system with both know that
there's only reachable by privilege

107
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,350
processes

108
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,690
procedures there's this is the ball or
know the

109
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,500
unloading her role models but if you
find know that the bar so there

110
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,820
it's again not something that will be
really exploitable in practice because

111
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,130
we need to be rude to

112
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,469
call that's a steeple store so we need
to take care all of these

113
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,680
all holes when you measure the election
office and that's what I'm going to be

114
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,490
present the next few slight so then i
do.

115
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,770
yeah services I think you're reachable
and the reason I mention it

116
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,049
is because often is the issues with
Victor switches

117
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,240
brother is yeah yet reports that you up

118
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,560
I'll into the program you're looking at

119
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,600
and the idea for us was to use the
reachability overturn a lower

120
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,330
regenerated overhaul the journal and we

121
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,099
at which he's a go to achieve reachable
for the attacker

122
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:51,460
based on assumptions that we make the
boots all

123
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:56,669
the most though the you can measure it
with traditional

124
00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:00,568
good quality metrics such as all number
of lines of code

125
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:04,849
season so little so go to

126
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:09,009
one example so this is a Road each of
those here

127
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:12,219
and the function is for example he

128
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:16,840
Carol the each of the edges are also
looking to the old

129
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,369
to you generate that's that and the

130
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,669
you want to introduce and the boys you
will need to hear

131
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,830
those can be the system goals for
example the

132
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,750
I think you can potentially unusual what
they did to accompany

133
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,089
home some importance of the so-called

134
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:38,089
coat that will be checking or all

135
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:41,279
privileges in the list all the or calls
to

136
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,700
capable function which will check
whether essentially with a view

137
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,290
rules or laws so this is what we call a
barrier function

138
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,069
what you have the all

139
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,850
you can go to into your reachability
analysis

140
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,329
your YouTube for you know those these
three functions all

141
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:01,609
reachable a

142
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,750
the zoe Ball State into a builder for
your phone please

143
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,310
a new update some well of the whole row

144
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,500
which can simply call the elections and
then

145
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,430
as I previously mentioned it does not
upload for this local police can

146
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,800
number of lines of code here and from
this

147
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,620
example we end up with 370 lines of code

148
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,100
all right let's summarize this

149
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,360
which talk with for all homes for some
configuration this girl is total

150
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,680
forgiving configuration a little still
from their religion writer AP in Brea

151
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,760
tokens and we'll see the Royal

152
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,090
well so functions and all compulsions

153
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:50,140
with the Easter weekend create the
subset of people there service

154
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,240
then by a in a nice but break to obtain
a measurement that we can use leading

155
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,110
role for

156
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,210
I'll comparing different approaches and

157
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,930
media exit of course you will learn how
we

158
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,420
come up with those I feel for you
functions and that such a very important

159
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,439
because this isn't sure what the
assumption you're making on the electors

160
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,790
security will taking their so we present
in security mall that you use

161
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:21,459
all the first holes the this is a

162
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,790
security mall so this is though

163
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,810
in the running total year

164
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,479
your system call interface the coral and
also love it or loathe

165
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,640
bit already loaded into running kernel

166
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,920
but they're also little girl models that
can be on the mend though that

167
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,610
though or simply drivers and the royals
of course oversight pixel

168
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,029
little Carlos so in this

169
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:52,790
security mall we assume that the thank
you both holes and open it up

170
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,270
occasion that's typically the case if
you're thinking all

171
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:01,270
something like a roller skate I'll
something that tries to escape the

172
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:06,420
some books pros location they will try
to find a minority

173
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,060
within the girl twisted Colts also the
implications of

174
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,300
privilege does access the system called
your pics

175
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,410
those are the assumption that you're
making based on the

176
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,920
people upper partial exit the support of
the boat that was issued this is a

177
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,900
simple interface

178
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,069
the coral and the LG are already running

179
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:29,589
will be within the at Texas but you'll
also

180
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,870
some on the most notable for all models
which will be

181
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,540
Texas because cool from those

182
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,550
Carlos in the Lord with all the money
together

183
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,939
requests and girl will happily load

184
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,600
for example I'll so yes it does RDS

185
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,630
automatically when you start using them
so that means

186
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,939
with the Philippines is up with this is
the Google

187
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,450
perishable and for the real functions
cool

188
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,730
say for Chandler only a couple vote in
the poll

189
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,100
which Expo privileges who also

190
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,480
remove all drivers and mole on the
middle of a political turmoil

191
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,130
rules because or get the drivers

192
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,570
for all levels below the you can defeat
to put the drive the the corresponding

193
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,110
are aware

194
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,000
person to the a into your system which

195
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,889
like Maltby world reasonable with global
might be easily

196
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:29,699
is but in the society we were saying
that

197
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:34,930
the whole wordpress.org assuming so
that's also what we remove the

198
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,219
consider them over you're talking to
there are also some other the deal with

199
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,380
a lot going into

200
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,959
right now only getting with the
publications if you're interested all

201
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,029
simply asking a question up to for so
the burbs that we know that there is no

202
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:50,410
estimate yet that's a personal interest

203
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,290
and privilege process just like what you
will have a problem homes

204
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,560
so those list there's a variant of the
security model which he calls that's a

205
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,000
where we do everything the same was
except

206
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,100
with issuing the there are no

207
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,740
on the military launched the reason is
the

208
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,440
in the loose ball others actually siskel
political

209
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,810
enable over to prevent I'll

210
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,839
told those for me know that but it

211
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,440
so that will be something that you can't
bear it

212
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,800
finally we up the generous security mall

213
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,120
gente se the where recently

214
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,800
assume everything but but there should
be a Texas everything that those

215
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,630
be able but I'll when you well your
total

216
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,660
so the reason we do the sister

217
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,079
I'll for the wall have a parole all the

218
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,029
exercises that you can't possibly have
all that system it

219
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:52,630
goes close leads to what people have
traditionally used

220
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,020
the literature to quality faux isn't she

221
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,760
so trusted computing base alright

222
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,339
slow although that measure the elective
office

223
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:08,070
well-preserved one of the two mechanisms
came up with

224
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:12,670
spoke about them early theory which
allows us to reduce a girl alexis is by

225
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,709
making use of

226
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:19,970
I'll the political your ability of the
next door alright so what we want to do

227
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,140
is to go from the

228
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,279
huge this old enough to something more
manageable

229
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,490
what that means in our experiments that

230
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,200
you go from the five thousand future
going to be for all to about 500 futures

231
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,660
does 48 use case where it will be
running a life cycle is

232
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:43,020
achievers PHP state another said yeah
he's a little used

233
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,900
particularly those in the car you might
be

234
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,610
most you are probably familiar with this
menu that many people

235
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,900
me for the Los Toros where you can
enable or disable or

236
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,100
in a Bologna's modules I'll different
features of the list or

237
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,390
this is rated spent all the time about
or maybe

238
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,029
a few days almost over get close to the
mall

239
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:12,520
a Journal because there are about 5,000
teachers and that's just for X 86

240
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,130
and you will obtain something close to

241
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,839
milk or I'll and you have to

242
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,160
take my word for for it you don't have
to trust me that it's very difficult to

243
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,860
do that

244
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,850
eat healthful in the store with a little
stroll million Spurs

245
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,480
the that

246
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,050
the questions for the prosecution or two
about that he has no idea which of those

247
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,459
parts distribution the pencil he would
also like to thank you close a min

248
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:44,470
on patrol USI so with all that problem
buddy

249
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,740
automating the bus you know where a we
do though

250
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,120
by clicking traces of going to what that
means is that

251
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,880
you need to know and that's very
important you need to know the

252
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,689
Netherlands

253
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,060
what your workflow the use case will be
salon where they will be using that

254
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,869
parole for gandhi also voting machine
and what will be running

255
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,200
with that or so those based yes I'll see
you later

256
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,170
was you know the we want to obtain to
doctor ordered

257
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,760
you skated we do that with this

258
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,970
forceps it's easy to see on the back
there

259
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,040
but we first start by running the
workload that we're interested in

260
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,740
and collecting traces from the car look
at which functions

261
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,310
or be all inside the coral itself from
there

262
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,010
can use the debug symbols to trace back
to the source locations

263
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:38,939
and his belief that need to be you be
able then ordered up for that could be

264
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,400
compiled into the kernel

265
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,400
than we used to talk all on their day
here that will generate

266
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,829
essentially a the dependencies that
exists in the girl has a fully informed

267
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,410
about

268
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,300
for between the I'll the configuration

269
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,680
world k don't think current
configuration it's all

270
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,790
I'll the if that's the way to go

271
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,629
a the together with basically

272
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,500
the the values that we've collected from
placing it so I can put them into the

273
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,959
formal or informal

274
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,700
will get that all about within the South
solver than simply sold out and bought

275
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,420
the

276
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,560
wall current configuration that
satisfies the traces were interested in

277
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,940
so we do that we'll pay or get the
ability to listen here we compiled

278
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,950
or home

279
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,900
a the opposing to look at this as a
delivered which

280
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,440
force close or being compiled into the
girl so this pro

281
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,120
indestructible holy I'll x-outs is just
so

282
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,699
number of course father lol the

283
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,950
in Orange Grove I'll the file be removed

284
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,060
from your base general

285
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,100
compared to the territorial which is in
blue so you'll see that for example in

286
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,169
drivers yet ninety-five percent
reduction in the number of foreclosure

287
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:01,590
the well and that's very nice but as I
said before

288
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,500
it's a bill be removed source file that
we are really doing

289
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,950
a lot of useful work in terms of
security because it might be that

290
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,120
those drivers or simply never loaded
fruit and cheese

291
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,320
suitable to the hardware for so we
really want to know

292
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,389
the other suppose that you the exit this
reduction but we achieve something to

293
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,970
show the

294
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,310
result I'll so those

295
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:29,450
and the veneration with a use case we
also have another evolution

296
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,230
in the papers you're interested it

297
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,970
but first I will start with for up
something that you've been the only

298
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,750
which is

299
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,950
how good his face a face because

300
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,210
we will be tracing the applications

301
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:48,320
looking at home in the features we need
to be able to work today

302
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,540
but it might be that we are missing
people

303
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,870
features if we don't tracing of do if we
don't praise for O'Neill

304
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:00,010
those is what we call convergence rates
for that price

305
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,760
you all to trace to converge quite fast
because you don't want to be tracing

306
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,290
system for malls so

307
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:13,200
this the experiment with the whole all
the taxes we have the time after the

308
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,610
system finishes booting

309
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:18,479
all the one that says we have a number
of through configuration features

310
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,000
that need to be able in order to I'll a
cold that satisfies all those places

311
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,850
and overtime room

312
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,500
different workloads also author good
thing we

313
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,370
decision to the server considered this
great little surge in the number of

314
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,449
features that we needed both coral

315
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,490
then we simply request well with page
from your server

316
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,630
well there's a little so terrible and

317
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,910
next we perform a more intensive on

318
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:53,730
true love to morning more intensive
request all the web server

319
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,380
ish Bieber you can see there's a
significant increase their

320
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,150
the reason is that the school trigger a
budget to create

321
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,580
local processes and to enable

322
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,290
inter-process communication between
those processes and that means

323
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,590
you charles futures and bring them to
the this

324
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,750
Lois with a three-run skip fish

325
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,750
skip fishes so whether addition security
scanner

326
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,660
from Google and it will the nice thing
about it is that it will however since

327
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,750
the live coverage of your web
application

328
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,370
Google try it each of the different

329
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,550
PHP scripts that you have with different
request

330
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,680
therefore its cool trail

331
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,680
almost or close to her a as many of us

332
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,780
you having a revocation this is nice for
us because it allows us to test whether

333
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,980
traces that we have so or also
officially and it turns out that there

334
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,920
are they are so does the vote

335
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,170
five minutes after the booting the
system there we have enough traces

336
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:00,140
even after running script with alright

337
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,070
Soviet exit this reduction resolvable
make nice grossly

338
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:09,290
this these walls all your baseline
colonels all religious debates all

339
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:14,360
because although you would have any new
lines of code

340
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,439
in the Nolan's total solution

341
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,060
if you're on so-called 3.0 curled

342
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,610
love sits below the code here reviews
the

343
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,419
there are many a the the logo that this

344
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,040
sabino compiled into the kernel for the
duration dependence

345
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,520
and also because many of the code is
arctic char been

346
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,629
so that's already one interesting result
who gets a

347
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,640
the a good deal poets and writers all

348
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,010
about is also significant Alexis within
all the resources all

349
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,650
depositing that were being sold the
court or all

350
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:57,920
so be prepared us to architecture which
is a little below along the lines of

351
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,210
code

352
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,460
which means an 85 percent that this
reduction

353
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,720
but that's only in the general security
mobile we assume that everything is

354
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,000
pushing the cold

355
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,720
is within your texts or so if you go
back to

356
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,090
moreover we r all me

357
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:20,059
something baseball what the letter to
the successes simple interface

358
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:23,590
with C would go down to about 2.6 the
last

359
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,899
called so that's or really interesting
but it's all

360
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:29,928
if you are not a cure you call just
final

361
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:33,429
and even know if you wish and all and
that'll and hope that

362
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:36,590
it will be regional there's a good
chance that

363
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,809
if you do that you wouldn't find

364
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:42,960
you complain the you'll be able to treat

365
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,179
to compare to

366
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:49,440
to work with the with the third goal in
the last thing you that we obtain a

367
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,620
similar result in you can also see the

368
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,090
the real the reduction is not simply
drivers

369
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,260
as be look that before but also in all

370
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,750
so themselves for example the soul is
completely gone because you're well

371
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:07,190
your web servers simply not meeting is
so when you're treating it

372
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,510
has been in town is a bit alright so
this

373
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,799
circle his second part though we will

374
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,490
switch to 34 where want to look at

375
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,510
station same idea but doing it a trundle

376
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,849
world trying to not legal political and
trying to be in

377
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:30,499
12 soul nicer guarantees in the you know
it

378
00:23:30,499 --> 00:23:36,149
less rules so we won't

379
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:39,809
more effective as reduction also what
the

380
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:44,749
the the reason for that is the we will
be Tracy

381
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:49,469
and potentially preventing goals a
function rooms are empty

382
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,629
will look at individual functions in
that room though

383
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:56,769
what to say or the total needed by that
particular application people

384
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:00,259
what that means is that you can also be
a big issue specific

385
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:04,839
so different applications will it be
decided to put loyalty within the total

386
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:08,168
the futuristic oh look at the functions
you can

387
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:12,079
essentially previews for job the
applications themselves

388
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,739
and have different views for education

389
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:19,019
for the challenge is there the first one
is

390
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:22,089
proposal had because we will be doing
the enemy

391
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:25,569
is from additional Carol bro so

392
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:30,239
you want to come up with a way all not
tripping up too many of your

393
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:33,819
proves that the insurgent coral and the
second

394
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:36,918
is false positives because we will be
more rather

395
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:41,979
looking at each for all functions the
tracing that you will do with local over

396
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:42,979
just quickly

397
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:45,999
as the future rather interesting that we
mentioned previously

398
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:50,609
rights at a given that you feel

399
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:53,759
probable cause that we perform this

400
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,509
following experiment a your own

401
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:01,639
different machines different occasions
for additional

402
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:05,030
Biddle Road year so that's a vote

403
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,770
and want three moles in here

404
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,280
so within with unwanted Primos

405
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,530
you will have everything that converges
so the x-axis we have phone call the

406
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,670
logarithmic scale

407
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:23,120
the y-axis with both I'll number of
remain internal functions to be traced

408
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,649
before we go virtual

409
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,550
so what did you see is essentially

410
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:32,899
long tail effect there the is looking to
grow

411
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,580
I'll with the means that is pretty bad
and there was a whole

412
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,240
was that he will need to wait like want
it removed to convert your full set of

413
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,770
functions that will be the search for
for a given told fortune

414
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:49,540
the reason for the others that can be
all sorts of conditions were difficult

415
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,020
puzzle trigger

416
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:55,280
for example I'll a memory location but
feel that some point

417
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,550
little so we need to also think about
that problem

418
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,379
find a way to address it in some way 33

419
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,850
do this at one time and we'll we've come
up with some ways

420
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,070
so here's though

421
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,360
four-phase all optics that we have

422
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,040
the first hole is a pretty early phase
where

423
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,330
will take or although the girls voting
that are available for tracing

424
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,320
and we'll look at which functions are
triggered

425
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,790
a bozo control and will call

426
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,950
those coaches system setup did

427
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,260
so for example would be able to see
related to

428
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,410
memory allocation there you so often
does

429
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,670
we really don't want to really continue
tracing the

430
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:47,260
the there would be no all so from there
we also

431
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,470
the address of archie Joe Cole the
Lerner said and this will go into the

432
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,770
Norton Facebook or

433
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,910
for each workflow that you're interested
in furs up additional

434
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:00,060
religious and the pool

435
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,440
the movie news base define a given

436
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,510
analysis said for each other because
what that means is

437
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,410
we'll see which functions in the coal
overuse for a given application

438
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:14,390
under it will prove that you're
interested so this is this that goes

439
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:14,860
into

440
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,570
30 face ritual well tried

441
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,689
clustered those totals in the way it's
reduces the number of course was 24

442
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:25,910
rather increases the convergence rate
that we have

443
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:30,680
so this is the coat closet you should
consider the annual the final phase of

444
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,630
enforcement

445
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,140
where you actually want to prevent those
funky

446
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,340
from being those other functions from
being call

447
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,540
location right to the two steps Thor

448
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,340
interesting here is the first that which
will be

449
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,639
they're all this reason this the whole

450
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,760
removed many of the payroll functions
that are used

451
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,460
very often in the coral this is great
because

452
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,900
I'll but means that you don't though
false overhead

453
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,510
related to instrumentation those
functions and second

454
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,740
think that's a huge thing is though
posted um

455
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,200
detection for both prevention face

456
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,570
alright so for the first phase

457
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,909
the pre-order face as a previously

458
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,200
we have will be looking at functions
that will be hit

459
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,890
were given frequency they may conclude

460
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,870
computed and that we will you can order
spoke a little

461
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:33,889
to give an example here we have a long

462
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,950
all the export file system and

463
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,810
the export file system will be what this
go to

464
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:44,770
essentially a look at new laws and with
this function

465
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,980
will call another function within them
this

466
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,440
social ends up in also often when we
trace the

467
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,690
the girls that think that the trip so
proposal so that's a nice thing because

468
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,440
it means the

469
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,580
removed approaching consider that in the
system itself I'm only traces

470
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,580
that mean for cheats all and in this
we've got the

471
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,409
service reduction that we might
potentially be interested in by removing

472
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:09,980
the

473
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,020
propulsion but still not having the
falls below 30

474
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,020
of the Tracy thought

475
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:22,040
functional teach execution of the
Fortune local

476
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,289
but the whole also

477
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:28,739
reduce the performance were even those
whose faith

478
00:29:28,739 --> 00:29:32,649
we we do some moving a little punchy
what that means is we

479
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:36,189
base also proprietary we say that

480
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:40,049
two functions in the coral are
essentially gmail is with respect to

481
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:40,779
fruition

482
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,879
so well although things you can do is
basically

483
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:48,488
local Baldwin big at all but it was
agreed by

484
00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:52,549
file which means that if two functions
already cleared within the same

485
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:56,759
political sources the group them
together the same thing

486
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:01,820
with the director is where they are I'll
declare and finally we also do the same

487
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,529
thing with

488
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:06,469
um k-means clustering over the Coco
Rocha funky little

489
00:30:06,469 --> 00:30:09,940
the college other or clustered together

490
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,229
so with this is looking for here use
this issue before

491
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:18,369
both folia another interesting is
actually in 14th place

492
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:21,658
all because it's actually quite tricky
to

493
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:24,769
do something well she did that that

494
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:28,509
girl fucking that shouldn't be uses
energy use by implication

495
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:31,779
reason is to fall first

496
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:34,799
there are also posted as I mentioned
before that

497
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,359
need to do it we don't want to really
trust girl once

498
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:42,689
when in 2004 with that because he would
be reducing the security of the system

499
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,820
so that's not really an option and
second

500
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,899
is that you will have shared your states
that those memory that will be allocated

501
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:50,949
within the

502
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,619
process beginning a flow of the
opposition

503
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,839
process but that will be used by

504
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,030
other processes or

505
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,350
all other part of the Colts all so

506
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,070
if you will if you would busy kill the
process to appoint

507
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,439
you might and I'll with memory leaks you
later love with

508
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,980
the loss in the current cell to the
holes the

509
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,390
possibility that you have so we have
essentially two choices for

510
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:20,360
important phase first one is simply
logging

511
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,469
I'll the violation and that might seem a
little bit

512
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:29,260
the sorority all but in my opinion is
quite useful because it will be hot you

513
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,120
will be having

514
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,739
or did lots of essentially the
suspicious thing is that okay

515
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,980
figure in your journal and once you
realize this is the something Rodwell

516
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,090
wrong and that your system was
compromised you can go back into those

517
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,220
laws and say

518
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,510
how long has this been happening what is

519
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:51,210
but they usually the up to exploit that
the attacker to got voted off

520
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:55,620
the whole thing a looks like to me quite
useful

521
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:00,620
the second course that your up this too
is such a switch

522
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,750
once you do that this anomalous behavior

523
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,030
into the hong more the execution of the
total

524
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:10,850
and we have the paper wrote little this
is just the will be presented in

525
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,149
November this year

526
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:16,820
and I will do quick overview what we've
though the

527
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:21,939
so we is to the traditional building the
car will be billed the journal

528
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,060
each of the objects that though
comprising total

529
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,460
in two versions: the first version of
the kernel

530
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,620
is bill as it would normally be been

531
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:36,969
and the second version all is built with
harding et je Jersey

532
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:41,700
enable into the coats all so we put
these two together with the

533
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,880
modifiable system that we go and the

534
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,930
enable you to choose a throat I whether
you want to run

535
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,140
in the harlem load on

536
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,400
old for example you could do something
as simple as

537
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,920
up to to prevent static solution that
these were

538
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,720
be you will be alright the the trade
infrastructure in the girl for example

539
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,740
will each time this bike is determined
that you just che

540
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,490
whether stock quarter is below for the
informal

541
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:11,180
that would be one thing that you can do
windows hard and functions that you can

542
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,090
both

543
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,760
so the the nice thing about that is that
you can have those

544
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,340
potentially very cost he ordered
teachers the only getting able

545
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,020
won something a little bit happens what
that means is that

546
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:28,210
through your normal use of the system
they will be loopholes

547
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,050
overhead pulitzer to those who wait and

548
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:35,840
14 okay Noel talk about the evolution
results we obtained with

549
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,110
I'll work load all over that machine

550
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:44,770
which is used as a development server
fertile observational for all within two

551
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:45,450
days

552
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:49,060
with those all yes it's the middle we've
looked at

553
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,230
that paying for the goal which is an
interesting you skate

554
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,540
Italy expose all many servers

555
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,210
on the Internet looked at my school

556
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,850
server we've also looked at

557
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:06,040
the the tree near even for

558
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,550
KTM which is running in userspace

559
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:12,830
alright so we for each of these

560
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,219
a petition we have plotted all

561
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:19,370
though all this rough which

562
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:23,339
on the x-axis as the exodus reduction
that we measured

563
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,860
in the static site security mall in
terms of local

564
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,740
so that the percentage and on the y-axis

565
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:33,819
people were just all number two

566
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,920
as a percentage of the total
observational so the

567
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,870
for other than two days what that means
is the if your own though

568
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,810
lower right hand side of his brother
your application is

569
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:48,409
a what you're a Texan has reduction it
is really good

570
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:52,759
I'll okay support each of the
obligations we have

571
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,030
adult and will also different colours
all for

572
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:59,230
the different groupings that makes that
we've live with that so we can compare

573
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,400
their effectiveness

574
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,080
thanks to the way that we've been called
defining Texas

575
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,509
for instance we'll just see the

576
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,780
when you don't perform any grouping wall
of course we obtain the highest

577
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,160
effective this reduction because it's
the most

578
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,430
run their approach but will also very

579
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:21,230
I'm hopeful urgent started you might
think of doing father be

580
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,370
and you do gain I'll little bit

581
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:28,410
in terms of convergence time in some
cases but overall it's not really

582
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,509
interesting because it's

583
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:33,240
just seems like you're you're reducing
your debt service reduction

584
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,950
withhold gaining much evil work and stay
in general

585
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:41,149
again make a similar comment with just
looking at you

586
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:45,920
you can see that if we use k-means close
to your doctor or up

587
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,420
will amid the obtain the same effect
this reduction

588
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,640
a directory rubin however people were
just looks faster

589
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,549
global virtual 2.5 those faster than the

590
00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:02,749
file the or no being paged

591
00:36:02,749 --> 00:36:07,689
so that's also something interesting
that you can do what you've been called

592
00:36:07,689 --> 00:36:12,219
fall the benefits that you have alright
so with the

593
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:16,729
like the row the so it would seem the

594
00:36:16,729 --> 00:36:21,169
a little experts can be quantified this
is useful because

595
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:24,920
the Los to elevated effectiveness

596
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,989
all given forgiven mechanism that you
complete the look

597
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:32,349
we can go out your results or
developments

598
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:36,119
either way that allows you to reason
objectively

599
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:39,150
boat which mechanisms all superior to
all others

600
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:43,999
we've also seen the the collectibles
reduction techniques that will

601
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:48,069
though effective in preventing tool
exploits switches

602
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:51,509
spoke about them tailoring you would
prevent

603
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:56,359
with the alexis was looking for that
does about 285

604
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:59,799
%uh 485 live in CE's

605
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:04,310
a within the you

606
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:08,020
within the ice is executing all him for

607
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,340
world of course for well the phone use
cases that so that the limitation of

608
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,480
both I'm killing approach

609
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,430
we need to know in advance what you will
be using your system for

610
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:22,430
however that is reasonable forties like
embedded systems

611
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:26,100
where people will just be putting limits
all and living in

612
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:32,569
there in the freemen updated if you're
not satisfied with that been so look at

613
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,660
the road then approach

614
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:38,080
which both also both very old that this
reduction

615
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,200
did 184 sees that would be prevented

616
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,330
though 262 in the state security mall

617
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:50,310
essentially is more flexible because you
can decide which up the issue you're

618
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,490
really interested in it

619
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:55,100
well it also has are you think surface
reduction

620
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,190
but also slower overs for it remembered
art

621
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:03,160
Google version congress' five minutes
your

622
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,109
that small mole spore triples depending
on which group in your using

623
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:10,350
and because I'm a cannibal

624
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:14,350
practical a in the sense that when your
own

625
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:18,100
before leaderless I didn't put them in
this position also have them if you're

626
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,900
interested

627
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:23,580
show all your the new overhead or no
significant or

628
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,440
overhead baseless the law percent all
over any local you would be interested

629
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,250
in

630
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,700
and Islam intrusive in the sense that
we're not going insane

631
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,330
we're modifying the coral source code
we're just using

632
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:41,630
the features that the total developers
love develop such as

633
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:46,290
the political tutelage of the coral or
instrumentation provided by

634
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:50,960
keep troops alright so this settlement
organs or replace

635
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,530
vertical look at

636
00:38:54,530 --> 00:39:01,530
more details on the peeps its

637
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,410
any questions

638
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:19,098
yes

639
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:23,069
mandoline a yeah

640
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,790
all I'll early little

641
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:31,170
girl

642
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,490
dating the all

643
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:37,859
so sorry could you repeat your question

644
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,360
the little bit a using he not

645
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,780
a few for his ailing his now

646
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,850
you already and you know from

647
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:52,220
your I'll though have I'll

648
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,520
however so the use case will keep both
heroes

649
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,869
different writes a yet though your
modification

650
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:03,700
force field goal you want to apply the
hospital within Google

651
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,390
essentially you would be

652
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:11,549
in the same problem as we all know we
have a %uh

653
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:17,110
with their own version because was your
day really need the

654
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,650
for uncle has been called and shouldn't
be call

655
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,950
by the application which is what you do
even with

656
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:29,770
I'll key cable the world you basically
you would have to

657
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:35,820
right total the cool the other is all
the members potentially be located

658
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,790
alone the pup

659
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:42,250
or also on law although

660
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,030
looks at you with the so far along the
PAL

661
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:48,200
a thats she those biz

662
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,470
thoughts for all and it's all a probable
achieved wrong religion

663
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,629
it's rather pull what do you all should
that love

664
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,020
thing so I don't think it will busy but

665
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,970
khak wrote themselves are useful in
their own

666
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:06,500
wasteful for their

667
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,690
world for real purposes the bills

668
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:14,890
for blows

669
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,319
for you those burn

670
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:23,210
and will see the miles

671
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,359
name is your putting

672
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,480
class the bills for

673
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,090
limber I don't love a little being a
local however

674
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:37,190
you can find it lonely release the the
total

675
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:40,280
for real warm

676
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,890
portable version in the lower than
tribal your own system

677
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:48,160
and run that a you decide to

678
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,060
Google Undertaker Taylor annual sold

679
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,490
old the software closer

680
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:58,819
the him guys

681
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,720
issues

682
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,000
no we haven't three

683
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,710
but we did though the principles love

684
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:13,200
list your summit earlier few weeks ago
and their sole

685
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,169
plans for but those your ownership

686
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:20,610
but the weather sludgy doesn't have to
be integrated

687
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,630
him to the curb been you can do it

688
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:30,630
portable 1

689
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,030
lovely lovely people

690
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,630
world thank you

691
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:40,509
gold

692
00:42:40,509 --> 00:42:43,799
not lost yet hopefully convention but so

693
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:48,630
still get reused like this year

694
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:55,400
I'm all look

695
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,450
cool

696
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,499
all

697
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:06,839
put their at the point where you can use
it all production system really

698
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:10,808
boat or hopeful that we'll be there
usual

699
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:16,630
that

700
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:21,410
yield

701
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:25,538
yup peaceful he

702
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:28,599
mom people

703
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:35,279
lol here

704
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:39,099
yeah the street his

705
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:42,390
his the street

706
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:46,120
who

707
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,200
the other so that would be interesting

708
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:53,029
optimization to go but actually
achieving results

709
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,440
I'll even without the musician European
good

710
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,350
Texas reduction in the end up to that so
it's almost certainly

711
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:04,620
a fundamental problem but i i agree with
you know they will be

712
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:08,540
process that will just trial holding two
seats available and maybe the

713
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,590
walls and the been using it because

714
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,670
the fluids and gases fossil

715
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:18,320
well suited to their needs but a

716
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,500
in the middle to his huge pool

717
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,410
he said

718
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,899
all is no yet

719
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:34,590
who'll

720
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:38,230
hood

721
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:43,540
yet called

722
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,390
yes it's a you're right depends volatile
right

723
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:50,400
so when I was talking about this is
Nicole

724
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,650
those talk about you know

725
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:55,690
system call the doctor were box below

726
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,500
totaling a liberal oprah's process there

727
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,420
you don't love but little get the car
goes and so something till

728
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,220
your device but the G if it at that

729
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,290
but local which we haven't considered
action

730
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,060
but you could do measurements with that
for the last fall but I just

731
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,549
JTAG port you're interested in done as
you say

732
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:24,550
with also considered in this situation
'cause there

733
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,359
just good you

734
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,790
yet I'm

735
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:38,550
Taylor hurled which is them

736
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:41,620
the a

737
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:44,890
juneau with you yeah

738
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:51,890
war

739

be

740
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:02,250
be okay yeah so

741
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,900
such a good system David police more yep
it's official says the

742
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,860
itself the purchase a little so

743
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:16,860
it would be interesting to look at the
XA system the for example

744
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,540
yet

745
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,970
call

746
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:29,680
alright I'll so we use

747
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,299
to go by Others all this is Ian from
Missy

748
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:39,400
and to see bills the simple ross thanks
you

749
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,930
basically all the the trick with
building all roses basically always told

750
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:44,940
reporters way

751
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,270
alone as he has good

752
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:51,520
Thursday busy in reasonably

753
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,660
designed for all use K will pray

754
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:58,240
all right that they those 4G orders into
a call

755
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,709
from the sea we haven't been able to
really get its

756
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:05,210
work let him 1420 however it's still
nice to get

757
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:10,920
so the for growth in the old cases
because those holdings and see the whole

758
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,960
and we've both the stolen which is your
birthday and that they will be careful

759
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,620
and with a look that song dresses and we
know that it's

760
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:22,049
do go go that route is basically
reasonable

761
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:26,530
team to make measurements all but the
solicitors along that they would you say

762
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:30,020
or all total going to kill

763
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,800
it would be nice to actually told

764
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,810
get released for get with Caldwell's

765
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:40,890
supports you could potentially improve
the measurements obtained

766
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:47,890
his

767
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:53,210
nap his

768
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:57,810
they their

769
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:02,860
all his

770
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,370
be Union tree

771
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:10,520
he

772
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,670
me very me

773
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:17,670
be seen

774
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:20,860
but that's good

775
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,970
the Nets India that surfaced and that's
what we're interested in

776
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:27,040
love the older

777
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,210
all untrue I'd be interested if you're
older cases of

778
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:34,280
like variable he did you think should be
there full

779
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,810
based on with %uh the but capable photos

780
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:42,350
we put basis to remove the driver lolol
them in the global

781
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:45,509
functions with also removed I'll

782
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:48,820
sums up the I'll sheared off by looking
at

783
