1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,420
that

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,030
the

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:21,020
well West

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:28,020
air whatever care to hide

5
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,180
okay hello again %uh so this dog is

6
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,900
a beginning go home computer illusion in
yugoslavia

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:44,900
by talk with you I'll go the

8
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:50,699
before I began a I'd like to apologize
first

9
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,700
for my may be strange accent

10
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,750
because I'm very allergic to a rosacea
and a nice

11
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,420
the seasons so if I though competes to
my nose

12
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,840
please forgive me heard as a

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,259
Nicholas said the right ok would be
about to

14
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:12,710
beginnings of whole computing in
yugoslavia

15
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,740
the before I begin with that

16
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,169
I'd like to say something about myself
and while i doing

17
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,380
that's thing that I do a

18
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,710
a very passionate about T old computers

19
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,899
her specifically 1816 to

20
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:33,509
beats computers from eighties and
nineties but

21
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,000
but I'm not very fond of PC machines

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,440
solely for anyone wants to

23
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:46,840
donate me something please don't be a PC
I

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,440
holstein look I mean a whole team to

25
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,440
we too old computer started somewhere in
the

26
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,630
2011 when the

27
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:01,009
some of my friends and I a made the I'll

28
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:06,640
society called once upon a bite our
first big event was seen the

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,780
2012 and it was a exhibition for the

30
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,020
Michael museums in the lobby site the

31
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,360
we are placed at Department Colt

32
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,680
archaeology which was very suitable

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,830
actually and that night we had the

34
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,000
more than 6,000 with a terse a

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,500
okay maybe not because of the of
computers made maybe more because the

36
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,610
we were in the you see above no its not
be

37
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,990
the we usually gets lots of visitors but
we like to say that

38
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,060
we had a lot of visitors that site the

39
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,110
the main the goal so far

40
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,690
our societies so preservation over the

41
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,810
all computers sold software only to pull
it better for them

42
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,570
for in that regard to we collect

43
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,190
those machines fix them and makes it is
a vicious

44
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,310
the

45
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,740
those pictures so from the like took the
museum's 2013

46
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,980
I didn't the actually

47
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,230
collect from this year that moment

48
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,100
the did those once out from the logos
back camp

49
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,450
1&2 and the last year's I'll call also
you have a small exhibition down in

50
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,179
basement

51
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,830
right now so

52
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,510
Troy my professional background by low

53
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,709
time Linux user I P check the effector T

54
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,200
of Lower East Side so several

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,890
process about computing okay

56
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,160
let's begin a history class

57
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,530
the I don't know how many of you know
but

58
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,600
actually doing good fifties the and 60s

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,170
the yugoslavia was one of the six a
manufacturer support the authors

60
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,920
in Europe always sick six countries
produce computers in yugoslavia was one

61
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,320
of 10

62
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,260
unfortunately the when the 60s came the

63
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,429
for some reason the yugoslavia abundance
its

64
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,150
computer research and mostly imported
for once

65
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,700
mostly Honeywell and I'll and Dec

66
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,909
heard depicting that was a very
important for the call

67
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,310
home computing was the invention of
microprocessor

68
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,930
first one was Sir developed by Intel
engineers

69
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,170
in 1971 and it was called 400

70
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,130
for it was a four-bit process sir

71
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,620
and only 10 of its current at the time

72
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,990
the the best thing with death was that

73
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,800
the for a lot though several years
people actually didn't know what to do

74
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,460
with that

75
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,650
think her so the first a small computer
whole computer appeared

76
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,890
overall in the 1975 that's for me

77
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,250
forty years later but when the first one
came out to it was followed

78
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,900
very quickly by I'm not the once in the
next couple of years

79
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,890
from 1977 to 1984 a lot of

80
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:21,440
for the coca hopeful to their superior
to you will probably see some of

81
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,250
them that maybe you used and thief your
favorite one

82
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,610
isn't here I'm sorry it was simply too
much of their

83
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,010
thats time so what was happening

84
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,820
in yugoslavia well holworth starting
doing

85
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,140
call computing well the team he is that

86
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,820
at a time we had very draconian import
alone but said

87
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,490
that you cannot import anything that
this more expensive than 50 deutschmarks

88
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,140
of course a any computer that you could
buy outside Busch

89
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,979
was so several hundred deutschmark so
its will

90
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,950
it was practically you legal to import
computer into yugoslavia

91
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:09,890
so

92
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,479
for the 70s I don't know but to

93
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,920
during the seventh issue practically to
do hat loco computers

94
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,100
a I mean the I'm not sure about the lows
during 70s I know that

95
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,210
big companies had the their fault

96
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,680
in yugoslavia like holly wellin back and
they sold or

97
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,160
those computers but so under what
circumstances I don't know or

98
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,270
okay so the first solution for a

99
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,260
someone from yugoslavia taller computer
was

100
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,550
smuggling I just practically

101
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,160
a game of for falling across this
officer that

102
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,390
thats strange typewriter isn't anything
expensive it's just some

103
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,960
keys that you used to rights letters
they aren't

104
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,109
but the the thing is that it worked

105
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,260
at the beginning but customs officers

106
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,700
very quickly drew learnt what those
machines are

107
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,750
and day wearing to actually I think

108
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,610
well I think they were a of course they
were so

109
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,810
officers that you could gave some

110
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,050
think and he will just

111
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,120
look the other way but the and

112
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,500
the the sorting football importing
wasn't

113
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,700
the available %uh global scale so

114
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,479
very few people actually had computers
before 1994

115
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:38,740
for

116
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,990
the second solution was to buy a
computer fraud

117
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,540
for from one look D very few firms that
heads

118
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,750
some import contract but

119
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,500
because of deedrick on the Olympic
charge us certain those computer but

120
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,550
legally here

121
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,850
for often to three or more times

122
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,990
expensive then computer some the a in
the rest of the world so

123
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,890
with two

124
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:09,780
regular salary issue practically
couldn't off or something like that

125
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,150
and of course the turd

126
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,549
solution that came to traditional 1984
was still

127
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,320
bill your old computer the

128
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,590
in october of for 1983 at

129
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,590
in the one love the science magazines

130
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,830
at a time call to go locks here the was
placed the net

131
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,059
for a computer Kate thats you could
build

132
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:38,530
at Joe Cole the the main the

133
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,429
for some we let the or developed that
computer was a

134
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:46,750
way out on each actually conceals %uh
outside his here

135
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,980
for giving collect next lecture after
running

136
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,990
a into hugh was for developmental

137
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,070
a prime difficult for computer during
the whole summer of

138
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:04,250
1983 a attended the summer he came in
contact with her people from galaxy are

139
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,380
and eighty cited

140
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,400
tote right tool a setting a kit for up

141
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,000
the reason that it was possible because
all the components

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,010
separately were cheaper than 50 bucks
Berks so you could buy

143
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,210
component to that that they're cheaper
but you hate to assemble it yourself

144
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:26,480
a when they are placed the nastiest

145
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,070
expecting something about 50 200

146
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,590
gets old and they were very surprised
when they

147
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:40,170
coats about 2,000 orders

148
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,040
the Galax your

149
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,189
was actually inspired by something
you're probably

150
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,220
no more it's called Sinclair tactics

151
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,120
81 it was also already simple machine
with so very few

152
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,490
integrated chips and it was very cheap
for

153
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,079
in the UK oh why did why I actually

154
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,609
a made this computer well the first
thing is

155
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,980
that it was practically legally
impossible to hold one

156
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,839
in the second one is that too because in
debt

157
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,060
practically in yugoslavia you didn't
have a developed any kind of computer

158
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,949
culture

159
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:23,540
that was practically common in the West

160
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,399
so the main course for Glocks your work
to be cheap

161
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,970
it to be the good for learning the

162
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,209
went into work alone on that project

163
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:39,079
I mean what was that the project was his
own but to they understand though it

164
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,680
should help lead to development ok'd

165
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,689
operating system and given that I the
ship to develop

166
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:49,910
helped me to develop in the harbor so
what made

167
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,389
the Galax your cheap and unique the

168
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:56,889
the first thing is that the mainboard is
very simple

169
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:01,579
it could things have very very few chips
you have the process to help memory and

170
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:02,149
have

171
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:05,680
somewhat the a lot a logical gates

172
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,939
thats basically it a

173
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,160
as you can see I dealing to the

174
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,240
say anything about

175
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,230
the media output which is something that
home computer should definitely have

176
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,980
video output is some eight a entirely

177
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:29,120
by said to some desert CPO so you that
you didn't have a a cheap for a video

178
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,980
it was all done in software because a
debt

179
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,460
running programs some galaxy or worse

180
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,020
relatively or maybe more the relatively
slow because maybe

181
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:46,750
the 18 eighty or maybe ninety percent of
process a title was spent on generating

182
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,500
graphics

183
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,900
of course you could still no the graphic
a generation ago big game or speed if

184
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,980
you want to do some coke

185
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,440
calculations the

186
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,070
the characteristics of the computer or
relatively modest

187
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,900
it had six killed by soprano in four
kilobytes a from

188
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,079
a in debt for kilobytes of from was

189
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,090
everything that Galax second duel it was
basic interpreter

190
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,810
it was a software data generated
reducing loss it was a cold for

191
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,939
input/output into it was a a line editor

192
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,430
it all was cramping to only only 4k

193
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:28,410
a second thing that

194
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,620
made a galaxy of for the both was a
single site that

195
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,220
PCB port buys that important because

196
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,040
if you have a single-sided PCB board you
can practically

197
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,680
the make while a call if you cats if you
buy

198
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,910
are PCB and PPC be bored and have the
right chemicals

199
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,329
you put easily built it at all if the

200
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,860
if Galax it was developed with it
blogsite PCB that would be

201
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,590
very difficult to make I mean to make it
all though the Los are

202
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:06,590
relative it takes so it was up wrote to
his successful process to make it

203
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,420
a Black Sea are also to offer special
deluxe your

204
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,550
had only 10 but so so

205
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,899
the boy up predicted that her

206
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:21,820
it would be nice to expand that's
computer and the places on the

207
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,410
motherboard were left for our

208
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,019
additional rooms which were also
developed

209
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:30,180
in the Lex month so

210
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,229
10 second row from the likes here
contained for example

211
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:40,579
monitor pro growth for writing assemble
Colt a

212
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:44,149
for Galaxy a there were several pair for
Rose developed

213
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:47,860
one of them was joystick you're probably

214
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,089
wouldn't recognize something like that
for a joystick

215
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:54,420
it was a all also Lahore completely

216
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,630
self-made and actually to connect the
joystick to go out so you had to make

217
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,529
some small

218
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,790
modification so the motherboard the

219
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,860
a similar to singlet computer Sant

220
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,190
many other single likes to use the hair
and make

221
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,200
outputs to connects to a tape recorders

222
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:21,200
so you could to load or save programs

223
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,240
think listing think work a lot more
interesting thing about clocks your is

224
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,510
that too because it was sold in the kit
for

225
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:31,620
it actually didn't have any kind of case
the

226
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,459
so you could see something like that and
also you could say something like

227
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:41,109
this one actually the but the one was
one of DA fuel

228
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,000
that were made by our company and they
will

229
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,270
there was a company who made to about to
or 300 Galaxy S for school so they

230
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,930
aren't the only one that had some kind
of a case

231
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,380
a with Alexia first time appeared

232
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,399
it was a very big news that yugoslavia

233
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,040
time because it was practically first
computer that someone from a

234
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,560
yugoslavia whole could buy about that
Kaine the

235
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,779
most of the media at yugoslavia at that
time

236
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,779
the jump the bed Michael and the

237
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,689
guy likes you I was well about promoting
newspapers TV and

238
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:20,748
radio the one love the

239
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:24,309
radio hosts you could also see him out
site

240
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:27,439
is our lovely ahead the

241
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:31,399
radish a radio show that was called and
288 2020

242
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,509
or fed 2020 and it was so

243
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:39,679
in the show about to technology and

244
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,749
he got in contact with to developer so
the likes you

245
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:46,779
and one of the things that's dainty it
is that they admitted

246
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,879
the Alexia programs over the radio waz

247
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:55,660
so the actually a host would say at at
one time okay

248
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,809
prepare your tape recorders so it but to
the setting a tape deck

249
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:02,899
press record and recorded a game for
gossip

250
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:06,689
so you could or program so you could
around it

251
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:10,599
later more adventures he was a nurse
galactic sink though

252
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,619
directed to collect SIA and heads
practically

253
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:17,089
to wireless dole alt in 1984

254
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:20,649
a

255
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:24,410
a lot of public that the 100 extension
us were developed

256
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,529
a go except game the

257
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:31,660
sorry doctor gained high-risk graphics

258
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,839
South capabilities more memory and saw

259
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,429
and does extenze rules who are mostly
developed by

260
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:42,949
boy more advanced collects it was urs
about our

261
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:46,079
you relate tear also I'll

262
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,319
no go except plus was developed by

263
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:52,639
to young man if they're not to do it in
your touch

264
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,160
it was a practically compilation of all
the

265
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,410
a hardware plus we'll stand it was over
sure

266
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,899
more

267
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:05,309
capable machine the

268
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:08,689
it is sexually not very the

269
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:12,199
loath quote the how many good access
were actually

270
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:17,309
mate a there are some the speculation
that about

271
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:21,220
80,000 kits were sold but because they
could build one

272
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,449
completely from the off-the-shelf parts
there is speculation that there are

273
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:27,350
about 10,000 likes yes

274
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:30,959
were in existence maybe not all of them
finished

275
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,110
to the end but so sometimes there are
ten thousands

276
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,689
you can see here in the picture so love
the cases that

277
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,179
does this all go locks yeah made for
their machines

278
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:47,940
a as I said because there was no
official case there are

279
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,970
practically a as different cases as

280
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,690
as collectors every collector hat he
sold out yet how the computer could be

281
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,470
packaged

282
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,059
earlier today

283
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:04,760
it is very difficult actually to find

284
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,980
I'll be some go axiom why

285
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,260
a the or the wild the cracks is that
were made by a company

286
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,540
but too late for schools they appear
from time to time with the auction sites

287
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:23,059
and you could buy it for certain amount
of money

288
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:26,610
okay but said the ones that were built

289
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:30,799
bites constructors they're usually
leading lady generals

290
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,840
jealously kept by that in the

291
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,340
those with the machines that they
invested a a lot of time

292
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,178
and that they're wary dear to them and
the so far i dnt

293
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:47,660
I haven't heard about the case that any
cost structure ever sold

294
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,570
it's like salad I may be wrong but I
haven't heard something like that

295
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,270
her so what could someone do if

296
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,660
wants to play with the Galax ya and not
to use an emulator

297
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,030
in 2011

298
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,280
that temporal and the bush in which

299
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,700
at a pizza Research Center developed
something called

300
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,550
micro coaxial

301
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:14,860
it is actually I alexi a closer look
developed on the PGA

302
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,059
report but they actually

303
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,190
made the replica vertical axis yeah

304
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,570
and extended its capabilities by adding
caller

305
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,750
regional guy except had only black and
white graphics

306
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,860
the the call was at it in such a way

307
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,669
that you could practically caller all
the Galactic gamez

308
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:39,140
and run it in collar without changing
any of the Colt a

309
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,420
def this version also had the mestrovic

310
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,400
that emulated tape recorder and that my
storage was big enough to hold

311
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,170
everything ever developed for to accept
the

312
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:56,480
another project was finished in 2012

313
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,450
it was a project of Thomas Schulze and

314
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,179
he developed CMOS go XCR it is
practically good luck said that to you

315
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:06,210
could build tweet

316
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,460
parts today a whale both so if you're
interested you can go to his site to get

317
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,650
the scheme ethics

318
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,559
and build one where self the

319
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,020
actually Thomas Scholtz the also gave a
talk at CCC

320
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:27,070
2012 about the he's fine it's a public
alike sequel deal to medical except talk

321
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,760
you can find it to the Internet it is so
very very interesting

322
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,270
okay

323
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,330
that was the go ok CR our first computer

324
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,919
and practically our most important one
because it was so

325
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,030
made in much larger quantities than at
the authors

326
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:48,090
the so what are the others computers
that are produced

327
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:54,770
we had the coppola 10 ended they didn't
have had the success and the Galaxy a

328
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,240
hat

329
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,210
the the difficult staying with the

330
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,190
the other computers so was that day

331
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,940
a a doing or mostly made for schools

332
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,900
and the thing is that when schools
change the equipment's

333
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:18,190
all the key equipment was usually
destruct that leads to a situation that

334
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,230
even if for both clients

335
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,670
one of those so computers you don't have
any documentation for them

336
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,870
and it is very difficult to find
anything

337
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,479
a if anyone has

338
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,860
any documentation about those computers
please contact me okay

339
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,110
let's see what we had at first one

340
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,260
is called Lola 8 it was developed by
company called

341
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:49,900
he will %uh debugger the the development
started some were in 1983

342
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,820
but the for some reason so I don't know

343
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,689
which should that computer didn't came
to the market until

344
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,770
1985 or 86

345
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,810
that company usually at fairs

346
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,560
in yugoslavia solti prototype so the
computer

347
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,700
and the because they only showed
prototype

348
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,120
at the fair's there was a joke a timed
it to load was developed from fair

349
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,360
fair the

350
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,330
the actual model that came to the market
was called

351
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:27,530
lower 80 it looks like this and actually
Tesla

352
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,389
ready clean what port the

353
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:35,110
the downside was that it was very very
expensive

354
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,790
and practically it was only salt tools
Sold discourse

355
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,110
the know the households actually had
this computer all

356
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,699
but I'm not exactly sure could you
actually buy it

357
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,910
for household but the

358
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,330
the computer that came to the market was
a very different today and the

359
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,439
prototypes the show

360
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,890
earlier and practically incorruptible
with it okay

361
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,260
next one is called golub segal

362
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,340
it was constructed but by

363
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,970
Miroslav quotes him and he started
developing developer

364
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,360
I think in 1981 but

365
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,919
the because he had trouble sweet
importing components

366
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,940
his prototype wasn't practically
finished until 1983

367
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,419
the sheik came the

368
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:31,470
to our company called pale and they
started

369
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:34,830
manufacturing this computer in 1994

370
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,120
but because those the Los that

371
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,168
pro prohibit the import we're still at

372
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:45,299
launcher the they had stool do something

373
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:49,549
to be able to import process or send a
memory chips

374
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:53,908
a the LOA to find said that you had you
had to have

375
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:57,399
a enough import so you could

376
00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:01,668
enough enough export so you could have a
so-so to

377
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:05,999
imported into the country and the team
that fell company did was

378
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:10,220
the to sell the homemade baskets
something like this

379
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,149
to be able to by process or sand

380
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:17,340
memory the okay

381
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,379
the computer was made to in holy

382
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:26,100
biting 250 basis and that was it

383
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,219
the reason for his the

384
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,730
very quick T-minus was the next computer
developed by Miroslav

385
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:38,210
it's called auto the that computer was
made deans

386
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,749
about 2000 pieces

387
00:24:41,749 --> 00:24:45,289
earned it was a very krummel school
computer in croatia

388
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:48,869
the

389
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:52,709
so people from the bell company

390
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:56,799
actually started to developing something
called oil plus

391
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,960
which had to well memory better graphics
et cetera et cetera but

392
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,639
that project never came to the market
actually

393
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:11,080
came today made something call the ahora
64

394
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,330
that was made in very few pieces and i
actually you couldn't

395
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,549
find it on the market practically

396
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:22,580
the first follower 0 was a the whole
Computer Inc ratio

397
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,799
a similar to

398
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,879
situation with go upscale in 2007 the
OSH

399
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:32,540
ya SuperOcean its developed

400
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,230
a replica of for 40 computer called

401
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,290
Oro 2007 end up are

402
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,600
over a year later he developed a 2000

403
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,260
8 version that head ID interface

404
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,280
soundbite sits chief maybe some of you

405
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,090
no where the C chip came from yeah

406
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,300
colour 64 and shared the stage

407
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:01,440
a specialized chief for the graphics
well actually you can find

408
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,360
20 schematics for this computer and you
could do it on the only if you want

409
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,889
another machine

410
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,080
which to develop in style started
somewhere in

411
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,250
1984 was called back call any closer

412
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,760
puts the market by company eighty from
meesh

413
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,350
the the computer was actual

414
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:27,520
cue the lot for this computer started as
a PhD thesis

415
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,020
pieces so far guy from meesh and

416
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,129
he was contacted by D a company

417
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:38,190
to plays that computer on the market the
thing is that

418
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:42,040
the that call was actually made as a
proof-of-concept

419
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,550
it was just I'll the

420
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,580
experimental computer so he could the
say

421
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,389
yes I can make one but it wasn't ready
for the market

422
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:57,230
the a insisted that put it a

423
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,700
to to produce it and the net result was
that

424
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,410
their own basic for it its operating
system was

425
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:08,020
40 bucks that were actually never
corrected

426
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,750
the last over showed I think it to use
for

427
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:16,720
still had the plan to Bacchus 10 the
famous one is

428
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,420
the related to trigonometric functions

429
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,559
if you're for example type

430
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,279
seem s a sign or from

431
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,409
and for example it woke up late very
fast

432
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:35,639
if you try the same a same structural
weight

433
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:39,269
big number you could wait for a minute
to finish

434
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:43,360
the reason is that because it was a
proof-of-concept

435
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,779
a indicate only our little

436
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,909
to the a sub struct

437
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:54,539
beef by frolo number two gets to the
something that you can

438
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:59,019
calculate but it was never helped West
the

439
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:02,440
peckerhead the one the unfortunate

440
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,389
think a fight at a time is that

441
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:10,699
a company wanted to coal tit first
yugoslav

442
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:16,840
whole computer or in serbia but every
dollar tip which the ritual that the

443
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,399
operation of that

444
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,678
work of those words or something like

445
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,169
apartment or bullish in serbia

446
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:29,230
and the for that result from Woking

447
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:34,080
which remain back on the

448
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,210
another interesting machine I guess

449
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:41,419
proper maybe some other heard about it
it's called the

450
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:47,409
Hobbit see it set our 84 weight was
developed to buy a small company

451
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:52,179
near know he sought and it was developed
by 16-year-old boy

452
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:56,409
cool the thanks to his father thought to

453
00:28:56,409 --> 00:29:02,009
very good knowledge of the electronics
where this computer was inspired

454
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:07,210
by 10d call quote and actually shed its
basic but

455
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,869
so all the other parts all the hardware
what what we're developing but that by

456
00:29:10,869 --> 00:29:11,379
that

457
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:14,668
high school student so

458
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:18,629
computer was made to only in maybe two
or three hundred

459
00:29:18,629 --> 00:29:22,119
thesis and 2 D's

460
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:25,869
they I don't know anyone who all set so

461
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:29,789
if someone knows someone who has this
machine

462
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:31,649
the

463
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:34,498
I will be well glad to take a photograph
sense

464
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:38,369
if possible tool take the dump of the a
promise from it

465
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:43,769
welfare have more

466
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:49,159
her seriously it is a very interesting
machine

467
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:52,469
and to I actually had the interview with
two one

468
00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:56,179
one up today people who were involved in
development

469
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:59,619
and the even he didn't had he's all

470
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:02,629
a peaceful protest had its time

471
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:07,309
the besides making your own

472
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:10,950
computers in yugoslavia so companies
decided that these

473
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,959
is the more cheaper to just

474
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:17,869
rebrand some of the four months so for
example

475
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:21,889
opening 16 from montenegro hurt

476
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:25,149
take something called cockatoo then the
cockatoo

477
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:30,359
the they place their own label called we
say the 85 and sold it mostly

478
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:35,908
to yugoslav schools actually this was my
computer from the high school

479
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:40,119
a wanting that was for me

480
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:44,939
interesting and disappointing for that
time is that when they came to the

481
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,659
first greater first hero for

482
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:53,029
the high school we had a teacher that
the wanted to teach us

483
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:57,999
basic programming it's this machine and
eating was is that

484
00:30:57,999 --> 00:31:01,509
that teacher actually didn't know any
basic

485
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:05,669
the by the time I came to the

486
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:10,529
first year I was already the familiar
with the basic

487
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:15,489
because my parents but the Commodore 64
few years

488
00:31:15,489 --> 00:31:18,679
are your a at

489
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:22,389
at one time that feature as this

490
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:26,158
to do some basic program that worked
with strengths

491
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,679
so I don't know how many of you are
familiar with basic

492
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,079
but in basic if you want to a declare

493
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:37,239
arrival that is a type of thing you had
to at

494
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:40,779
a dollar sign so a dollar would be

495
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:41,720
ice

496
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,390
a string wearable the the problems

497
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:49,380
that too that the church had its its the
book of programs

498
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,400
were all always had 30 a string

499
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,190
as a string for Apple my solution used
something called Seastrunk

500
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:00,640
CSC dollar site and

501
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,600
she gave me a very bad grade because
that program cannot work

502
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,959
because sting rubble must be call

503
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,000
a not and i cant so

504
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,490
around the program and 40 maybe

505
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:18,340
couple minutes convince her that this
actually

506
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:23,500
with mark I don't know that you had some
some experiences like that

507
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,620
yeah yeah okay so I'm not the only local

508
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,919
a another computer that was practically

509
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,250
mate by rebranding 14 computer was a

510
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,350
made by after tax stuff from Slovenia
and it was called

511
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:43,830
correct over 64 it is actually I we
pretend it

512
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:47,060
or a cat mose buckwheat 21 difference

513
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:54,060
and that is that the Ted for 64 east end
of 48 kilobytes a friend but the thing

514
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,410
is that

515
00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:00,420
the people who did modification to the
re-cap close so

516
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,960
actually didn't do its job very well

517
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:09,810
and the UK if you if you have the manual
for this computer it says something like

518
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:13,179
if you see garbage screen when you turn
it on

519
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,450
just to end of in turn it on again yeah

520
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:23,230
and in Capen saw with this computer the

521
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,450
want to think that was a very popular
the

522
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:30,540
in yugoslavia ending day rest of the
world was

523
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,080
to lawmaker computer the two maker

524
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,439
keyboards for the tech spectral it the
pictures shown here you can see several

525
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,850
of those key parts

526
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,090
they were called professional keepers
for tactics

527
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:47,199
and you can see why Love those keyboards
down a little

528
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,560
at the exhibition

529
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,360
the us solve the company sexual assault

530
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,360
set expect ross together it their key

531
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,479
all those keyboards as a completely new

532
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:05,480
computer smeeting yugoslavia the

533
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,800
more machines that were made in
yugoslavia

534
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,310
time the book where a cpl close

535
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:17,199
and PC close well actually there was a
lot of CPM close

536
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,199
made in yugoslavia before eighty four
and after

537
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:23,779
but those machines were mostly targeted
that called police and

538
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,179
practically you if you didn't work at
the

539
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,310
company for both then your practical CEO

540
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:33,489
and that is also the reason why a

541
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:38,918
there is very few of them left today one
of those computer swallows

542
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:43,168
team overlapping and it was so made for
schools

543
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:47,388
and some schools had them it was a rain
ice machine actually

544
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:52,530
but very few working pieces are in
existence today

545
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,879
us for the PC compatible machines

546
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,220
a several companies made them one was
from lobbyists out called

547
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:06,930
low carb L and another one interesting
was made by same company who made it

548
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:07,490
back home

549
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:12,100
her a the one interesting thing about

550
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,690
their PC his death it was practically PC

551
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,820
cram into a keyboard case so you had
something like her

552
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:26,220
the more larger vision of Commodore 64
if you look at the case

553
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,640
in they actually a made to the

554
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,879
machine with its helpless sissy
geographic's

555
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,450
in they also made a TV output for both
of them so you could practically connect

556
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,930
this PC to a TV

557
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:45,930
at home and work as a whole computer

558
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:50,289
okay so what happens to all those
machines

559
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:55,140
that were in the is a in existence in
yugoslavia it's the way

560
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,319
what they think is that there was the
companies that produce those machines

561
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:00,250
sponsors

562
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:05,690
to make the day machine is a freak by
selfish or school machine in

563
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:10,010
yugoslavia but there were a lot of
fighting get arguing

564
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:13,530
over death because there was a big
market in big money

565
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:17,819
unit they're fortunate thing is that

566
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:22,069
during does fighting's the

567
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:26,270
school waited to see what we'll do the
official computer will be

568
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:31,660
personal said there was no solution to
that problem schools both but that would

569
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,339
take court

570
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:36,259
day but domestic computers they bought
for computers

571
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,770
they both all kind of computers a

572
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:43,690
as you probably know all those computers
were which surely

573
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:47,099
though in copper to both so you you
couldn't the

574
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:50,529
safe program for low computer imitate
the Lord

575
00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:54,660
and load it on another I mean basic is
basic everywhere but

576
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,379
not exactly the same the

577
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,609
the solution to this problem came
somewhere in the

578
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:04,890
night team 88 89 it's all

579
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,750
when schools simply decide just to and
that it is our

580
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:13,910
a better option to buy a PC so
fortunately

581
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,720
the we do have situations that UK hat

582
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,109
where they had official home computer
that was actually used

583
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:24,460
at official school computer that was
actually used

584
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,400
at schools and at all p I guess you know

585
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,359
which one was that the PCB and later

586
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,190
a car a correction it

587
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,550
okay so what is with those computers
today

588
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,109
well for most of the machines so

589
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:51,380
a lot and waiters were developed except
for the

590
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,490
low-life 8 well-liked a because the law
was

591
00:37:55,490 --> 00:38:01,129
the a tilde last year I think we'll

592
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,599
actually made the rum dum all that
computer and

593
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,240
a friend of mind started stool work on
the emulator for this

594
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,310
machine the that the guy is a

595
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:18,080
you're taking your Louis chin he also or
you'll develop the

596
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,190
the and letter for Pacha machinists

597
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:25,490
are whole lot of individual seen the

598
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,569
yugoslavia I mean nothing all in serbia
your

599
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,180
other parts of former yugoslavia are
working on the

600
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,160
preserving of this machine's and

601
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,899
we are trying to make them remember

602
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,940
that is a part of our computer history
and some think that

603
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,020
actually shouldn't be forgotten it

604
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:52,280
and through the work of this man
including myself

605
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,280
the story of those computers the is
still being written

606
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:02,280
thank you

607
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,710
okay away haha love this whites

608
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:16,870
I'll move over here so if you have any
questions please ask

609
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:21,390
said yeah

610
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:25,799
yeah yeah

611
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,090
KS here a

612
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:32,090
you I the

613
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:37,050
i'll know I know I didn't know about
that I actually I was also in the of

614
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:37,550
oats

615
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,820
two weeks ago you

616
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,620
I

617
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:45,250
while I where play play had

618
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:50,470
yes clear place show I know but also a
very good people's you

619
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:54,459
ratio the simple yeah

620
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,310
but I have never had I to go there

621
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:02,340
a if he's been looking like black I do I
like that

622
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:06,560
ways yes 100

623
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,440
strange teaching experience yes primary
school really good

624
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,680
team the room I yes and

625
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,089
my future also good

626
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,430
alway are by line cool

627
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:25,080
radio fed correct my

628
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,520

633
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,020
after a few classes I started to write
for a

634
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,660
programs that could actually be written
in a few lights on basic coat but look

635
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,660
something like that
