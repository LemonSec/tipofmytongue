at JS and the kuch dil

44
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,060
is is presented so we've got something
like this

45
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,410
I don't know if you can really probably
can

46
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,410

the video I was published and no was
republished by several

48
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,170
I channels on YouTube and are

49
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,700
it disappeared from each and every every
one of them and a problem back then was

50
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,290
it

51
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,510
people didn't really make call piece on
your hard drive so the video so there

52
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:31,950
was

53
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,869
not really oh we school to put do feel

somewhat later during the presentation I

56
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,580
so Serbia and what ironweed really
dealing with is

57
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,670

58
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,809
of our the most recent statistics of

59
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,090

I news agencies to use Portales web
sites

63
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,418
six cases of physical pressure

64
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,560
on journalists like no no digital but
real

65
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,190
pressure a political pressure on
undernourished to court decisions that

66
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,600
can potentially harm to freedom of

in Serbian international

72
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,160
submitted by the negative reactions
which were

73
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,040
unfortunately pretty much neglected do
legal framework

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,250

97
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,040
politically incorrect so to speak for

98
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,650
for a certain person which had it
removed

99
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,370
I my he here are only some cereal

100
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,530
those serious so reasons why include

101
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,880
freedom of expression being restricted

102
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,760
whatever parent because he/she

directed by the EU which is not
obligatory by the A's

107
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,159

108
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,400
EU member states answered yes country
that aspires to the European Union

109
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,690
should be in accordance with these

110
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:06,870
director says an exception to copyright
infringement infringement

111
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,420
if day in france je for his be used for
the purpose of caricature party

112
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,440
were besieged then again we also have a
local or national law that regulates the

113
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,960
same thing any such totally not
accordance with Jay

114
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,380
European a European for reunion Fremont
and it says that

115
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,090
350 shimon to publish corporate project
at work is a large

116
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,409
when it concerns I'm not among other
things parody or carry pitcher

117
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,700
so I'll watch fish really did debase

118
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,360
for a for censoring DC

119
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,910
this video her according to the laws has
a ship should not be applied to

120
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,220
republicans is a serb it is not too low
actually it's fine to the Constitution

121
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,000
of the Republic

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,480
and I'm and then again I

123
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,360
censorship is forbidden to do is
conducted that's that's unfortunately

124
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,840
the

125
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,250
the reality apps a survey and who is the
sasser

126
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,290
any it's really hard to answer this
question but

127
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,560
I put some pictures here dead

128
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,680
moms and some kinda masses

129
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,030
lay government protecting you from your
reality

130
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,609
today really have to write to the bed
did

131
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,010
them the logical stay a

132
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:29,260
muster most the conventional media could
be satellite TV newspapers

133
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,990
et cetera is changing and because it is
not on an alternative to independent him

134
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,090
a sources to have a mechanism of
publishing hear their findings their

135
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:40,990
information

136
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,520
online without depending on budget so

137
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,760
or I don't know where the tourists et
cetera n

138
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,170
people kept taking it online with music
several different

139
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:59,360
different waz I've bullet tweeter first
because the Twitter community

140
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,090
is serious quite strong fortunately and
people are really tweet

141
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,450
about important changes not just for fun
but a

142
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,740
it's just cereal serious social

143
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,130
social and political political from

144
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,280
connotation and facebooking lower as
well not so much a straighter but

145
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,660
Madonna gender changer also in important
way to distribute

146
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,650
tweets so basically derringer also
significant Jess Jeter

147
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,110
part of the missing you know the slow
side

148
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,550
food here actually are some I
organizations or web portals that

149
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,709
I used by a independent journalists and
investigative journalists

150
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,120
to to reach out to the public jerry is
shining

151
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,670
and the CS don't national once

152
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,079
and doin aight only use ciation which is
an international

153
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,960
association of over 2,000 I

154
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,680
different agencies or a information
agencies do it

155
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,699
deal with investigative and only only
gene only singer vital for

156
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,650
for our democracy at the moment because
I in some way Jersey review only

157
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,800
so probably a trustworthy

158
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,829
media outlets not being sasser

159
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,430
even though they're under pressure
constantly but different

160
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,510
political and economically strong
structures

161
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,120
and we get dis this is something that
was

162
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,200
quite of chain and is seen serbia

163
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,900
jurate me two months of May and June
July does you who

164
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,770
who leave here probably remember for
sure certainly remember the

165
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:43,630
on many also I'm the news portals that
reported

166
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,120
I information regarding done Florence
and

167
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,560
the floods that have been made this year
and we have come to be heated

168
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,459
tho with and entire story where taking
Dom

169
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,600
no due to DDoS I attacks

170
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,780
some different bonanza attacks which I'm
going to

171
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,839
talk about a little bit later in the
presentation so basically we go out

172
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,920
I

173
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,260
the errors under on the web sites and

174
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,779
a people were panicking because they
were does is so

175
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:18,189
whole website website taking down

176
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,970
during period of 24 hour stores no
capacity

177
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,880
to mediate debt eiffel of attacks

178
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,529
and now we come to the challenges with
charger

179
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:35,430
miss something I'm now let us something
someone to oversupply me some the

180
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,138
mission of

181
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:39,410
know what I what I said are earlier

182
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,079
and and doom several different types a
challenges only five

183
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,680
to 10 maybe percent videos

184
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,829
as attacks can can be you really clarify
intervene in the Sasso

185
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:56,029
determining your source and

186
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:59,160
a month so boss a

187
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,920
included any tax so in most of the cases

188
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,689
not really possible to to determine
where is the

189
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,260
DDoS attack came from from the first
place you meet

190
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,339
you see the botnet route but she didn't
know who is dead brain on the

191
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:20,149
entire operation you can only make some
suggestions which are you not really

192
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:23,720
backed up with wat strong evidence which
is

193
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,220
I we changed it dan you cannot take

194
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,810
that case to court because it it Kong
dreamy

195
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,649
whole our deposit provider so
fortunately I know

196
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:38,740
are not usually very helpful because you
today

197
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:44,230
acknowledge germ I presence of such did
US tax dept and gives them a better

198
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,579
education that

199
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:49,420
their servers and not release a very
strong enough to

200
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,459
to support his this kind of attack said

201
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:56,380
basically what they say it know if there
was a problem with your website

202
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,490
you know your own database became too to
loom

203
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:05,300
I be in both the support OES published
sensitive material like

204
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,709
shocking information and a do providers

205
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,540
usually say it will you publish shocking
information so that's why people come to

206
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,209
USA

207
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,000
me ten million people cannot visit a
website in serbia

208
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,520
in the or so 24 hours to the survey has
about

209
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,819
many people are the something like that

210
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,940
security was or is something that was

211
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,450
or on the Securities not something to
seriously consider

212
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,980
you today unfortunately even though
after all these a

213
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,830
happenings from the beginning of this
year until now people started to really

214
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,800
thinking about

215
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,140
arm miss security in securing their
systems it's not

216
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,060
it's not still on now um I satisfactory
level

217
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,660
so that we can say that I systems in
serbia

218
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,350
PTC the system so far from from BGC and

219
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:01,380
I general habits of the people the end
users who were made

220
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:06,029
mostly journalists and lawyers and some
sort of people who are not really

221
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:09,330
um technical people I

222
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,410
don't care going to technical cats

223
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,449
such as the lack of

224
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:19,029
a backup is in the most common problem
because

225
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,450
when you going as them for a backup in
order to

226
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,740
get it there laissez alive again they're
just so

227
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,170
backup we don't do that so basically
country to help them

228
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,709
I generally better shave real patterns
switcher

229
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,989
resulting query general technical
literacy

230
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,839
any serbia poor people who are really
well educated but

231
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,950
the general public were into people who
deal with these

232
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,209
types of problems are not really really

233
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:49,930
the do

234
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,870
who day don't really want to educate
themselves news on it some kind of

235
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,460
special education are you too

236
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,720
learned several tools and tricks in
order to

237
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,000
to protect yourself yeah be issued from
the technical perspective ish

238
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,760
cost all 1s I mean you see

239
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,760
my ranch a botnet form

240
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,050
as much as sixty seventy 100 Dollaz and

241
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:18,920
successfully takedown a website date was
pretty much a dime a dozen said

242
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,209
a basically a it's easy for

243
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:26,569
new even the the structures didn't want
to censor something they don't really

244
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,720
need a lot of money

245
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,930
or resources to it they can just rent a
botnet 10

246
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,589
sorry get that from China Brazil
wherever d

247
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:39,850
next for me very important issue ish
demanded a 10

248
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,110
you'll see in the second case already
they had a

249
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,660
that the importance of of meta-data a
softening

250
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,250
more I'll is something bigger and end

251
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,350
the importance of the content itself
because

252
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:58,700
meta-data never live me that's not
entirely true because here

253
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,050
waste for UT may matchday Asia

254
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,180
line but and as I said before not many
people

255
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,739
I really use these tools interest you in
order to

256
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,400
hiding something some way or just
protect themselves

257
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,730
hum nothing to legally shoes feature

258
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,730
probably the the heart is because you
know the technical part

259
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,839
a bunch of technical people we see it
will sit down and soul

260
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,000
maker security strategy oranges security
system

261
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,890
as much as possible but when it comes to
the legal issues you have to deal with

262
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,569
to say it

263
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,970
and the same doesn't really deal wat
such

264
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,980
issues delores

265
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,580
regarding media and

266
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,630
it digital communication et cetera is
not really clear injured

267
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,780
buncha raise almost where I someone can
operate and

268
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,439
successfully fulfill their mission
without being punished by little we know

269
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
today being

270
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,810
considered a any in a court case

271
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,300
the courtroom processes loss for too
long

272
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,000
does to you again for from serbia a sir
Tony

273
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,130
no that you minimum I'll and dove

274
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,839
court process here would be about two
years for for something many more

275
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,329
and dish more complicated cases loss for

276
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,589
mean something silly dance an entire
decade or a couple of days

277
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,700
depleted the police doesn't have the
infrastructure to in the investigation

278
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,460
other crimes

279
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,460
I i think that this is not entirely true
mid because need to head the

280
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
infrastructure but

281
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,490
I problem is a lack of interests

282
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,820
in on their site to seoul I

283
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,399
some local some up to issues did it
happen on daily basis number also going

284
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,360
to clarify

285
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,459
on this later on in the second case say

286
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,270
there is a huge conflict of interest
isn't there was this one case rear

287
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,370
I'm material was taken down from a
website

288
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:03,610
and we me because this year mind and
that's me sticking meshing beginning is

289
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,360
how you know

290
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,870
wheelchair the fans offer free

291
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:12,229
services from technical problems for
both from both technical and

292
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:17,180
legal aside for people whose digital
rights have been affected in some way

293
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,380
so dispatcher was so sasser from the
internet practically and

294
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,380
I the text was related to you one

295
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,380
really prominent political fear in
serbia is silly

296
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,570
in a sort of power and a

297
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,330
we months to police and said yet we have

298
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,908
these evidence that someone from

299
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:41,080
I sure he actually took down the CDC

300
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,519
these texts from this website and we
wanted to investigate it and they said

301
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,690
okay we'll

302
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,789
and mom month or so later

303
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:54,149
day went to know I'm educational
training in Barcelona and

304
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:58,369
educational/training was funded by did
institution

305
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:01,709
ok which the person affected by the
materials

306
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,139
did we and it was taken down a

307
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:09,549
with the practically destitution be for
two training for the policemen to go to

308
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:10,499
Barcelona so

309
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:14,539
it's a fear a conflict of interest to
you I mean if someone gives you

310
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:16,989
something you're not really in the mood
to be

311
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,629
I me something victory is bad for him
its

312
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:26,498
actually theory conflict interest social
media are still not legally defined

313
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,619
which is really really bad UK

314
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:35,199
a it gives the power to reports to come
to some things to pursue consider them

315
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,080
arm I media like any regular media and

316
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,359
other times changes don't a.m. Saturday

317
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:48,570
if I publish something on on on a social
not toward

318
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,749
it might be considered I might be
considered a media or not depending

319
00:19:52,749 --> 00:19:55,839
on what hurts me more which is I

320
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,200
they don't give the protection of love
David

321
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,549
media get burnt day also

322
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:06,279
don't give the a but debuted

323
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,469
disadvantages such as a editorial
responsibility

324
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:13,859
accuracy of both the materials that you
published cetera

325
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:18,019
so basically I'm ABC is really

326
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:21,049
the another grey zone as mentioned
before

327
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:25,570
your many domenici the it will take some
time we headin your

328
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,468
media lauded bastard couple of weeks or
a month ago

329
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:34,479
and it's still not so good enough in
order to solve these

330
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:37,570
issues on a more permanent permanent
level

331
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:42,399
data a las both did legally issues she's
probably

332
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:45,839
probably the most important and instead

333
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,389
bed data retention less protection laws
so

334
00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:54,099
in in service still not defined fool
Hollow where when can

335
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:59,549
I use do retained 8a in order to
prosecute your

336
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,849
Jess I'm listen to

337
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:05,928
tool or use your communication whatever

338
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:10,999
it is a really um I mean legally during
are some limitations but

339
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:14,499
its tone is still not a clearly defined

340
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:18,019
coup in sao can can doing now

341
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:21,029
couple and yes they actually a change a

342
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,169
they're going to merge the I

343
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:28,379
be a and I love you have we share the
military and the CEO

344
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:29,428
I am

345
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:33,880
intelligence agencies and jail will be
and you'll also

346
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,600
na even nobody will know who and how can
and can't do

347
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,659
a can operate free week to redeem the

348
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:46,059
to which are retained by an almost in
mind internet providers small my love

349
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:52,139
the returners landline operator sister
dude

350
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,120
easily so ethical questions that I am II

351
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,169
rosso I'm going to discuss each

352
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,520
one of them shortly

353
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,500
um the first one is who watches
watchdogs

354
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:12,010
in in our society we can't legally have
watchdogs featured the police the secret

355
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,910
services the government in general

356
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:18,970
but squeeze 2012 watches damn we still
want to monitor their opportunity

357
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,110
in the weekday do work that way I'm

358
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,320
our detail or day work with the

359
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,539
censoring materials cetera so basically

360
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:33,309
we don't really a had watchers the
watchdog Scopus a

361
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:36,599
and it is a really ethically

362
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:40,349
I am is a easy during

363
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:43,739
there is no legal necessity for for
something like that

364
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:47,539
there is a strong ethical background to
to this question because

365
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:50,669
I home much can you trust your

366
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:54,549
your I government and special the secret
service's

367
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:58,609
is a huge deal I wish I

368
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:00,830
me personally I don't really

369
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,939
trust especially to the secret services
and I think it

370
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,550
people who have dealt with their
sensitive data says insanity for share

371
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,370
my opinion

372
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:14,189
I curiosity killed the cat but
satisfaction brought back

373
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:18,450
in many cases the government says that
days censor some people

374
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,460
or we told some I information in order
to

375
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,070
to protect the I'm the public

376
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,260
so that this first part the same

377
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,990
arrests killed the cat so that's why you
shouldn't be curious you shouldn't care

378
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:33,710
for

379
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,390
the information we hide from you because
it's for your own good at a race you'll

380
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,270
be killed

381
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:44,080
meant for sp but then it comes to the
second part dissatisfaction brought back

382
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,110
the satisfaction of knowing something

383
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,959
is natural the I comes natural to any
human being

384
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,650
everyone wants to know everything we're
curious by nature

385
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,880
i mean they're people who are not but
dear percentages

386
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,140
is is slightly are serious runner
smaller actually and

387
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,230
portion of us who want to know it all
and

388
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,330
a we we do have to write

389
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,639
to know how our who wants to real scene

390
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,750
in our country and what our governing
really does

391
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,390
self-regulation of or or so censorship
this is more om

392
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,930
related to the traditional media have
ito real

393
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,970
he added to our social in utah real
responsibility

394
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:31,640
you know so in many cases dad immediate
themselves

395
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,810
team down some material did they have
already published in a sense

396
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,740
and now that I've into something yes
politically

397
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,350
I not serve really I am

398
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,949
correct and Daisy publish it and you

399
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,190
in a couple days GB just a key takedown
and the precious

400
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:53,320
is it the is that act

401
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,889
herself Rachel a regulation because the
legally have to write to do that

402
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:01,020
but its small so some censorship which
is

403
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:06,050
really the worst I've censorship curious
I meet you can fight general censorship

404
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,100
with different tools

405
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,260
which I'm going to talk about it later
but self-censorship you count Yukon

406
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:11,750
because

407
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,920
I 80s and Gnasher chance that

408
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,820
doesn't really exists out there each
they can only see a self regulation we

409
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,850
published if we have direct tv did not

410
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,419
but what we don't know aren't
circumstances

411
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:31,020
under Rule which day no talk down to
said material

412
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,270
and I no we come to dish

413
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:38,870
this actually force you too much but
everything but not because everyone

414
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,570
is I'm I don't know if you

415
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,419
know the case so third the polish

416
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,480
a newspaper to publish I

417
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,630
picture of Angela Merkel breastfeeding

418
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,760
the the prime minister of Poland and I
think both

419
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,200
the Czech Republic nature but a and end
the Prime Minister

420
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,130
although it was a huge scandal couple of
years ago in Germany

421
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,340
and Prime Minister falling down said

422
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,389
it's okay it can be considered already
you can laugh at everything

423
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:15,120
buyer not with everybody so it means day

424
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,500
you should watch how you talk with which
is again

425
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,810
a shortened form of censorship you know

426
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:27,080
you should be able to share with your
opinions without frontiers is a

427
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,169
Universal Declaration SS so

428
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:34,450
I think this center she say you can
laugh at everything

429
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:37,930
with everybody an immediate Snyder

430
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:42,529
be HUGE HUGE issue even even nomination
I

431
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:45,919
many of us are all for anonymity but

432
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,110
I hear people who abuse it of course so

433
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,570
basically it's really part to me

434
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:56,928
now with the present tools that can be
used mostly for good

435
00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:00,779
I but sometimes there are use for bad
things as well

436
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:03,909
I to the journey I'll

437
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:08,740
who does what out there in cyberspace so
basically that's why I'm

438
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,769
on me just one issue jessica Lee shoes I
mean

439
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:15,470
people should be able to be anonymous on
the internet but

440
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:20,510
um be able to do better teams are also
known as sole

441
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,460
and we should find a way to telecheck
not today

442
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,830
mister I collective responsibility
because

443
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,658
this but not for sexual get refunded
DDoS attacks

444
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:35,990
was just ok many many many different
computers people let's hang

445
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,010
so I'll who is the one to blame

446
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:43,990
its sa7 in couples like that it's really
hard to determine

447
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,730
the source of the day entire attack so

448
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:51,220
basically there is a collective
responsibility of all the people

449
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,559
there included Indias in this process is

450
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:59,649
and define one is does the government
has a right to

451
00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:02,918
to protect to protect its people from
themselves

452
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:06,120
my answer would be no because I'll we're

453
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,268
smarting off in all not too a full time
to decide for our everything so why

454
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:12,870
would determine need to

455
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,299
protect us from ourselves so we should
be able to

456
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:19,460
access all information at hand decide on

457
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,370
what is clear about for us so

458
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:28,768
finally came to the second case I have a
prepared for today and it crashed

459
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:30,000
questions until now

460
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,260
yeah long ago the

461
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,100
to the you can

462
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,809
say up been on

463
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:46,158
movies you when I new

464
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,970
you you

465
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:53,880
Europe so who

466
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,120
yeah well russia's not really good
example for freedom of speech to age is

467
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,959
slightly

468
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,470
you know but basically thats that's one
really really big issue because

469
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,750
that's about social media used blogging
blogger service whichever

470
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,570
I you have millions of them and
basically if you had

471
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,480
more often is a 90 5 but i wasnt or
something like that

472
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,360
yeah and doesn't really matter some mark
which is not really unreachable

473
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,080
a bearing in mind a number of people
that are online special is writing

474
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,279
English everybody can

475
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,950
can from every point in the world can
reach you

476
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:34,820
so basically day debt is sort of abuse

477
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,908
arm for me to just I

478
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:42,899
day again day don't give you that
religious of being the media

479
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:47,510
buddy give you the rest possibilities so
you have an extra responsibility dare

480
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,419
you to not publish whatever you want

481
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:53,590
but you don't have the protection did
the law gives to the standard

482
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,230
journalists with and it is

483
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,539
I future both political and ethical and
legal

484
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:01,760
legal legal question I mean to what
extent can

485
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,029
I'm that abuse of a story

486
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:08,669
goal you and I i agree with you that
that's a really

487
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:12,639
really but policy so I hope we won't be
getting that anytime soon

488
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:13,748
in certain areas

489
00:30:13,749 --> 00:30:17,009
nato than normal so to speak European
countries

490
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:20,219
not to rush not normally I like putting

491
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:23,359
I

492
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,908
mmm I just that second cases

493
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:33,820
CES cynicism Center for Investigative
Journalism

494
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,279
of serbia Center in Neenah I

495
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,229
deposition asthma dishes that case I i
talked about

496
00:30:41,229 --> 00:30:44,709
a with a policeman going to Barcelona to

497
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:48,649
to be children to educate themselves
ever I

498
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:53,208
Center for Investigative Journalism
serbia published an article about the

499
00:30:53,209 --> 00:30:54,509
special treatment

500
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:59,759
0 child of a prominent politician in
serbia so soon after I bought two or

501
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,849
three days after publishing not

502
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:05,119
really about the a day after day the
published article

503
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:10,359
the only to Article disappeared which
was not to DDoS attack it was under

504
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:13,879
entire portal only be de single webpage

505
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:18,178
was not available didn't exist anymore
on

506
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:21,359
in the same time s chill the Street

507
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,749
low it was injected actually in india
database so that

508
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:31,779
it could listen to to juror email server
and just collecting meta-data

509
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:35,829
all everything that goes in and out or
or older

510
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:40,149
a email service and those of you who
deal in technology know that that's

511
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:41,458
pretty much everything

512
00:31:41,459 --> 00:31:44,979
so every single email it should get can
be

513
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:47,190
I not ready but is

514
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:52,040
it's meant to detail which a I hope you
are familiar with it

515
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,250
I'll I explain to me how to meditate of
an email consist of the

516
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,680
source I email address this nation email
address

517
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,240
source IP address in most cases and at
times sent

518
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,240
to subject and some water other
information and

519
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,420
by mapping and connecting days a

520
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,620
information you can see practically who
is communicating to call

521
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,199
and for the Center for Investigative
Journalism that means dead

522
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,330
de Jian really find out to manage their
sources switcher

523
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:28,720
on in some cases even people who work at
just before the state Lake insiders

524
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,120
so Acer really really big issue an issue

525
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,129
I'll which have your sources mad and you

526
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,270

537
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,590
happen for us I mean we've got a call
from seeing say they told us

538
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:24,790
hey you know our our website was hacked

539
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:29,960
and the I'll we are missing an article
and we don't know what happened within

540
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,560
so please help us and %um first the
first thing we didn't actually issued

541
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,300
older hosting provider and ask what the
hell went wrong did you

542
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,580
return to the 20 backup version of the
website was a problem

543
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,129
though

544
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:47,010
low-cost provider was not really
cooperative they were like or you come

545
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:50,530
and see for yourself you don't mean all
something happen

546
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:55,860
and we we have no idea what's going on
our service which is really

547
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,350
impossible if you're serious a person
provide on

548
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:02,639
and it took really time to

549
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,010
to access the server and gain access to
the server

550
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:10,600
because related okay give us a login
information so that we can login to the

551
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,699
web server and

552
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:15,178
just you what's wrong initially not like
you need to come

553
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:18,679
physically here hooey we cannot really
do you do

554
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,929
type booking information you said okay
we will come when can we come

555
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:25,810
and a set in about two weeks so a

556
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,810
in a week if you leave if you have a
normal crime scene when

557
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:33,469
something is stolen or someone is killed
%uh if you live it

558
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:37,189
unprotected for a week can you imagine
what happened away

559
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:42,200
everybody has access to a probably
detector still has access to it he can

560
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,739
you raise all the evidence

561
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:48,540
and Auburn factor see a place in mind I
don't know what dog cat can pass by

562
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,190
changes

563
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,879
rowing your evidence saying when you
come up to reach you find

564
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:57,549
nothing which actually happened for us
and down we can choose

565
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,700
go through this entire process of
recovering

566
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,350
I'll recovering dead stage of the

567
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:07,819
server we in which was bad a week ago

568
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,730
it's not only you cannot

569
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:12,839
you can never get 100 percent blast in
the meantime

570
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:17,880
does hosting provider I install some
occasions

571
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,890
on the web server which our for

572
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:25,930
protecting ice had yeah it's good that
you remember after the attack Potter

573
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,549
me it doesn't really have a point O to
stall

574
00:35:29,549 --> 00:35:33,190
something that protects your computer
after get access

575
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:37,319
a been done and no investigation has
been conducted

576
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:41,609
so we managed to get her some
information

577
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:45,900
and so we went with does in data to the
police

578
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,980
and a of knowledge didn't exist sooo
criminal case you're so

579
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,900
d shifted up and they send it to the
prosecution

580
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,010
office for cyber crimes which is the

581
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,230
state organiser VM and a lame

582
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,010
the don't have to capacity to obtain the
evidence the jury

583
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:07,119
the prosecution of his or cyber crimes

584
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,230
what text crimes to case all 50

585
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,470
don't have to pass it to talk to him the
steps above its big question

586
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:21,439
and dad team cyber forensics managed to
obtain a list of 15 IP addresses for air

587
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,299
potential sources suggest film injection
because on

588
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:29,890
as I said it's a huge stain they're
listening to song is the same to

589
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:34,220
your entire meal going in an arch don't
really control

590
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,299
do email for anybody can send you an
email and that can affect your

591
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:39,970
reputation and image channel

592
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:43,598
so once we got this Lease of 15

593
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,650
IP addresses who went back to GDoc

594
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:50,369
the prosecution office for cyber friends
a for the center France

595
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:53,690
and day asked for a shorter lease

596
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:58,670
and then we submit a list of six IP
addresses and they asked for a shirtless

597
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:03,190
again I mean what can be shorter than 6
IP addresses that hard to

598
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:08,059
I new DVD cease-fire they said it's
impossible to track

599
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,370
6 IP addresses and it said

600
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:15,980
really curious no number two bearing in
mind that

601
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,510
estate access to a bo roughly

602
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:23,500
300,000 times to

603
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,830
date at all farm different typos

604
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,009
subscribers trading mobile or landline
phones

605
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:33,550
tomorrow I mean day country the 36 users
which is

606
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,640
funny and after that curiously

607
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,980
to born 22 into summer recess and it
still has its own eight ish

608
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,870
started working actually week ago but we
haven't really managed to you

609
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,950
to see up to what point our

610
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:52,549
our case is gone but it's not really it
hasn't advanced

611
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:58,220
that's for sure so dissolutions side he
started talking about problems which I

612
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,080
don't rely

613
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,450
I always like to see it the bright side
so that's why I'm going

614
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,270
tell you what kind of solutions we
suggest any there's some

615
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,120
I trance year included I'm not
advertising for them but

616
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,589
it's what we use and we find them useful
you can use the same or

617
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:19,640
something similar whatever said

618
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,350
we had the issue probably you all know
what these things are basically

619
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:27,549
whistleblowing case a new trend me

620
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:32,230
not sure you've a it's become quite
popular and I'm

621
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,870
each became popular actually with
suitemates

622
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:41,270
and now we have local league speech is
sad really really extremely useful tool

623
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,980
for

624
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,579
for a result lower Sen

625
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:47,450
the journalists and people who are
activists in are interested

626
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,618
hot social topics and political issues

627
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,759
and I put your security job

628
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:56,989
I don't know if you know what it is but
it

629
00:38:56,989 --> 00:39:00,660
Buffington boss title low lease

630
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,019
platform so I some I am news agencies in
the world

631
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:08,180
use with someone platforms to collect
the

632
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:12,469
information from the community and the
good thing about these tools a special

633
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:13,779
globally sees it

634
00:39:13,779 --> 00:39:17,309
Dege the whistleblowers the people who
submitted a

635
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:21,160
the material total on me so your say

636
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,368
s DHS its access to internet web server

637
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:28,309
generally your your Mets DJ spy
protected

638
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:35,309
I'm yeah mechanism so

639
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:38,609
protections dear I divided among

640
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:42,348
I left her and right-sided I huge blast
which

641
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:48,019
I don't know if anybody has freed up but
he said something that is

642
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:51,569
symmetrical to DDoS if it did you
ascertain

643
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:54,630
distribute it in a way to attacked my
server

644
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:59,089
nao deflect the gives the possibility
tradition to

645
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:02,288
this unique event website on several
different occasions

646
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:07,029
there randomly chosen and you don't
really know where your website is but

647
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:11,920
its its online and I each mitigate
videos

648
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,420
acid attacks as they have to say
practically had

649
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:20,289
I if some part 2 if one location of your
website is attacked

650
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:23,390
you have the other one a lot so it's
really hard to

651
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,890
attack all of them at once it's
practically impossible

652
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:31,269
and deflect a strong infrastructure in
doing that indeed really have space for

653
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:35,709
for whom many more web sites and also
many people now

654
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:37,580
here some get

655
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:42,430
them gave some donate some up there
infrastructure link bandwidth and

656
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:46,299
memory and their servers for or deflect
which is really

657
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,300
which means that it's really
community-based and he

658
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:54,430
I'll is from the community community and
and for the community doing really great

659
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,500
if I see a few

660
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,590
if you want to secure your website I
guess I'm

661
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:02,910
against the USA strongly recommend that
and on the other side we had a

662
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:07,830
a different kind and tender mediation I
mean it's sort of whistleblowing but not

663
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:08,410
really

664
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:12,210
I death to all web portals find me

665
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:16,080
in serbia and the first one is in 10 min
said I'm tea and a sec

666
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,290
a move which means the region and
remembers everything and

667
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:23,330
the second one is the says all of coal
which

668
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,759
could be in doubt as a censorship firm

669
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,770
I cash so basically

670
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:35,780
BD should platforms well what we can do
is solely solo in some way which is not

671
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,270
true that were not home so it's

672
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:40,850
I much easier for general public but

673
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:44,150
again if so ha sitting awaited gives

674
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,700
a

675
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,790
lemme we saw or so to speak for the
people we who had the material

676
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,740
I don't virginity to to remain anonymous
and

677
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:59,299
right so basically he's going to make
any sense we use and recommend for

678
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:03,140
for so for protection and

679
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,770
me tatt these I issues we

680
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:11,720
week at debt would be everything from me
so if you have any questions thanks you

681
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,169

me or us there yeah also DLC black

685
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:29,660
both of these domains workers also
basically questions

686
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,390
yet largely

687
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:38,058
I

688
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:41,299
you low the

689
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:44,480
yeah I feeling

690
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,740
the this

691
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:53,169
even goals

692
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,180
is a the look

693
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,529
the the

694
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,240
this is a

695
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,430
you re the

696
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:07,660
so the yeah

697
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,690
with bells well

698
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,280
at me tool to fix the city's knowns to
human

699
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,630
is I can be used for both bed and

700
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:22,300
good you know evenly December you take
form

701
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:27,370
putting nails in the wall you know good

702
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:31,790
you can he is the same tools so we
cannot see did

703
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:35,940
anonymity is such is good or bad but the
way someone uses

704
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,180
an immediate I mean you can't not really
exclude bed

705
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,500
bad people from the site to get this
impossible virtually

706
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,360
so don't balance I don't know where to
balance would be but

707
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:51,470
up issue regulated in some way it
depends incorrectly to be cute because

708
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:54,009
you keep giving the company to see the
power

709
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:57,230
to regulate and meaty do want regulated

710
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:02,060
day and me to just won't be existing
maybe we need another independent body

711
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:02,450
like

712
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:05,620
I don't know 9 the

713
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,710
mmm independent agency

714
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,810
may be dead range leases but again a

715
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:15,110
maybe data and entire point of

716
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:19,760
firm the entire solution would lie in
some distributed way of protecting

717
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,950
anonymity because

718
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:24,890
everything this centralized is so back
in general said

719
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:28,690
basically dangerousness his show knows
that doing the best three

720
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:32,710
the more centralization and is the
worsened freedom and

721
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,740
and general a

722
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:38,540
man execution of human rights in on the
internet is

723
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,500
is impossible if its centralized but
when you distribute even

724
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:47,110
people the when the power actually in
the responsibilities distributed to

725
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:51,070
several different areas day have more
transparent and

726
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:54,080
real home freedom

727
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,730
on the internet and I i think that
deceiving would happen over time with

728
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:02,870
anonymity because I the anonymity
something that is this necessary in the

729
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:04,859
chain generally in the world need

730
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,620
privacy of some sort so Monday

731
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,850
debt would be my ass really hope you are
satisfactory

732
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:16,080
%um the yeah of course

733
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,460
it's all it's all up to possibly I who

734
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:24,610
when we have the saucy people talk about
things did we can meet the government

735
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:25,680
change something but

736
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,180
what I think my personal opinion is that
every each and every government

737
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,589
each and every party likes to have
control worries people so it's it's a

738
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,460
mechanism

739
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,500
governing all government so we need to
change our habits 9

740
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,970
in order to protect those ourselves not
expect from someone who sees during the

741
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:44,810
parliament or

742
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:48,130
the government or any ministry to to
protect us because they want

743
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:52,480
never not cheering on Team the
Netherlands not to US not in England

744
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,440
noting the Russia

745
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,450
or so basically a you

746
00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:01,339
world well dei you does the same thing
to its people said

747
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:05,420
his family you know basically yes

748
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,730
so any other gone

749
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:11,950
many girl dress the go

750
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,759
cool the I

751
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,270
proclaimed

752
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:18,070
I you

753
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:21,270
a jus be I'll

754
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,300
love is world your room and

755
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:29,290
breathe a little easier is where the
issue with you

756
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,890
cool deserve this

757
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:36,080
it well the our experience says that

758
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,400
our cloud hosting is slightly better day

759
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,300
conventional our seats so if you have
time I need the resources to

760
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,420
to have something close to it on the
clout and probably

761
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,210
outside of serbia maybe to Madeleine's
just a suggestion

762
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:55,470
if you have the money and the
possibility to do that I think this

763
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:59,910
a much better way to go then hosting it
right here and a it's not good

764
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:03,060
one provider is worse than not very
windy

765
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:08,320
face this issue so dade am having a
problem with security on their servers

766
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,530
because most of the servers 0 hosting
providers say is your be around server

767
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,530
somewhere else

768
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:17,100
mostly Germany Romania et cetera
bulgaria's of said

769
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,710
a day have these contracts wheat Shire

770
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:23,920
not really clear on who has a
responsibility of

771
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,670
doing what if the Germans here for you
day have so

772
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:30,880
Davis do is a bunch of issues that

773
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,610
come with it because they're not a real
providers say you're late

774
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:38,290
agents of the providers you know so
basically

775
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:42,960
the best way to VoIP system find a real
provide ample have to cook as

776
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,330
physical servers and who has full
responsibility over those servers both

777
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:48,200
physically

778
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,850
the digitally and in anyways so I think
I N

779
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:55,200
if you can afford a cloudy best so

780
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,850
miss it and %um

781
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:03,900
questions comments whatever now than the

782
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,670
mistaken he you

783
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:09,299

India be here in fetters I don't really

795
00:48:51,279 --> 00:48:52,880

free to be cheap to be OK and you know
like some basic things they don't really

797
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:00,950
think about security as much as the
Chilean several

798
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:04,640

about the fake IDs video I told you that

803
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:20,170

00:49:24,279 --> 00:49:25,859
activism in this kind of things

806
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:29,660
everybody on them made copies in their
hard drive so it was

807
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:33,288
much easier to start says ok and
internet so fun to because they publish

808
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:34,289
such materials

809
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:38,190

publish because there were legal

815
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,680
suggests he could go afterwards so if we
don't really know who the author is

816
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,310
because he was anonymous
