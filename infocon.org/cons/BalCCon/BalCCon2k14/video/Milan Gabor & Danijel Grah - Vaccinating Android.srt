work for the united states of we have
some famous people know

72
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:51,039
all this one got caught and I guess

bow soul we gonna see little bit so

76
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:06,439
motivation behind why we actually did
are you will have some short

77
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:11,519
11 ABK soul who has been playing with
Android application already

78
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,429
who has been analyzing taken by you

79
00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:19,518
okay 12 okay you're going to see that
it's not that hard

80
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,300
also we gonna go a little bit about to
analyze this so

81
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,449
and talk a little bit so about static
and dynamic

82
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:30,029
and we gonna show little quite a few
demos

83
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,699
so whose cool who likes them it's

84
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:37,589
okay for the demo species are we have
one regret

85
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:40,659
than with any other don't act wireless
networks

86
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:44,089
if you have wireless networks when we
will be showing it

87
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:47,559
share %uh you don't see the dams because

88
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:50,809
gonna who in they won't work because
even the

89
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,860
be playing real are like the life gets

90
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,490
and you have some a close up of okay

91
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,139
where we are today that I enjoyed sewing
also mobile application

92
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,579
are actually it's kind of complex words

93
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:08,429
that's pure living can also if you're
talking about the mall locations

94
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:11,799
why because the PCB me just see a
Android

95
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,519
our framework you know there is a lot of
love Irish

96
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,740
love building blocks and components that
are actually part of the

97
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,510
enjoyed framework in this release also
this

98
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,380
there are several are issues with the
mobile application

99
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,180
arm fortifying said it already had to do

100
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,940
the anything unless you're that are

101
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,540
the researchers can find in abilities

102
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,320
in about ninety percent of mobile
application that they have been

103
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,430
analyzing so that's kind of

104
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,830
no on worry about it

105
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,969
and also if you take 200 recent

106
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,400
both wrong yesterday or day before solar
researchers compiled a list of and

107
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,060
Rachel occasions that the law amendment
best

108
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,890
so they're not checking their SSL
Certificates ranged DPS connection

109
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,099
so you can play with so on the
connection is set yourself in the middle

110
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,790
of publication and the server

111
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,510
soul this kind of though miss kind of
the reasons

112
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,599
all brought us to this fence that they
are sexually a big need for more though

113
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:28,270
s and we also got love requests from our
clients the best mobile applications

114
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,650
also from Android entire as some home

115
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,280
on other operating systems and it's been
here

116
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,510
looking at this mobile applications so
it left the seems like the developments

117
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,090
know if each like nineties

118
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,090
so love us going Jackson on

119
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,909
server-side lot of problems with 0
client-side

120
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,080
arm and we have been analyzing also

121
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,280
love bottom but most is the medium

122
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,409
a mobile applications and BC love

123
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,430
lot of issues there ranging from very
simple

124
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,630
on to learn complicated stuff pfister

125
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,580
okay our own

126
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,770
11 a picky so actually what is ABK

127
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,190
how to get it how to combine it all
tested and at the end how to exploit

128
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,510
well we're gonna go this just

129
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,450
up quick through it so it's actually a
look back at five former

130
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,919
nothing else I'll and its I

131
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,090
I'd Indian didn't you this but you can
actually

132
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,760
who's running BlackBerry here the same
but has Blackburn

133
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,689
know that

134
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,190
but you can run a pic a signed right on
blackberry diversion

135
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,450
so I can you this but be keeping you set
so it should be

136
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,470
should be but I'm gonna try this so

137
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,680
are so I pick a sexually

138
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,489
as a setback should package for much
it's nothing more than a zip

139
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,060
so it's really an excuse me Java with
major libros you can have needed by

140
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,189
ballistic says there

141
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,700
the other parts of so there are some
lying

142
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,560
Android system and you have different
components like

143
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,800
activities services broke a six years in
use leather

144
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,859
so the somebody is

145
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,100
Jul Android developer here somebody
developing injured

146
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,150
from okay three so this is not nothing
new for you

147
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,410
right you have some resources at its
source code you can buy the

148
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,550
are you will get the dollars by

149
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,699
called put it in the glasses decided
I'll

150
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,980
and actually third you've tested their
push push it to the Google

151
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,520
to replace all new Ripper so that's a

152
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,900
that if we're to believe you're a decade
but what's are

153
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,120
you can also see what's the opposite
side so hard to reverse it

154
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,660
so how do you get the ATK for Spain case
you can copy from the fall

155
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,709
so just get ATB poll or

156
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,680
call more

157
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,209
and get the education the fall copy from
the backup

158
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:03,890
you can create a backup group on kind of
applications that you have on your

159
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:04,839
mobile phone

160
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,870
and you get to a BK way just go if you
know the application

161
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:13,190
full name which is go to the that you're
all

162
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,870
and use citro download it for you so
this is the first step you need a BK

163
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,170
or there's another way you can download
from one trusted source but I do my I'm

164
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,849
not sure if you want to run

165
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,230
from one trusted source who'll who wants
to run a pkg

166
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,520
from one trusted source taken from
Russian

167
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,569
forum ruled source

168
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:38,750
sorry who'll this

169
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,070
a good question anyway month yeah

170
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:48,120
qualm sometimes yes sometimes no but for
months resources sometime forms and

171
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,100
maybe sometimes you can find also with
thong who'll

172
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,640
so the next step is just to compile it

173
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,290
so if you bullets from the fall like
here like him

174
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,640
once every day to be binge isn't that
good I love

175
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,860
ghetto classes decks I'm just

176
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,100
to compile it J league with because it
does everything for you

177
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,220
are you can use if you want to look
defendants morning

178
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,870
you can though on there's only

179
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,930
there's a second way to to do it arm
then was gonna show

180
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,099
little bit living off to to his life
think how this is done

181
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,100
and so these are the tools that are

182
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,180
use I love to know

183
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:37,469
reverse injury ABK so thanks to george
you get from plastics to juror

184
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,630
although from classes flies

185
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,660
up to there's job well and the people

186
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,490
a good tool if you wanna go simplest way
you know because this

187
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,770
well sometimes you don't wanna go
through all the steps

188
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,319
although they're quite simple regions
goals online upload your a decade to do

189
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,020
so

190
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,050
with this site and it the composite for
you

191
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,140
also that he was gonna show you it's
just little bits

192
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,569
so how fast and how we use and actually
what you get from the combined

193
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,760
the serbs this

194
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,500
okay I will just show you who he is

195
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,000
the to get the source old baggage so
here we have fun treats package

196
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,240
and it's nothing but unzip file

197
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,640
so let's do another eap

198
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,170
and here we have the classes they expire
this is actually the

199
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,310
bytecode do you find the route to the
week

200
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:41,729
its is like job I've called but optimize
for a hundred

201
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,050
the I'm and untruthful so

202
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,560
I'm going are transform this darling by

203
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,560
gold to Java bytecode this take some
time

204
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,670
and snow over run Jiading we to show you
the

205
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:17,670
actual source calls and here you can see

206
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,180
sources obfuscates you have a lot

207
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:28,180
face the EC's but actually you can get
through it and if you manage to do

208
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,050
something replacement and stuff like
that

209
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:39,520
you will be able to read it sometimes
and understand the source

210
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,689
comment if u you suggested we

211
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:48,550
how many of you do know whole program in
jail

212
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,400
okay very so yeah I i manager fell

213
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,699
afterwards because we gonna meet some of
our some statement and

214
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,290
we're trying to figure out what works
whether those K

215
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,730
okay

216
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:10,380
from

217
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,410
okay so all we have an obligation for
what they actually you should be checked

218
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,589
if you're doing all securities as
members reinvesting

219
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:22,660
for all over mobile application so
definitely there is our transit security

220
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,000
so we want to see how we will traffic
goes back and forth with application

221
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,250
I from application to the server room
the back

222
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,620
are we gonna see how the sessions ok and
no whole session is found all

223
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,640
so if it so right way or wrong way to
certificates although they fit so

224
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,880
also we cannot go and man the middle we
cannot thank you man in the middle

225
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,770
thanks and there there are some other
protections like by love you

226
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,800
or maybe if there are some kind of data
is Lincoln SQ

227
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,839
she collided database some by okay she
I'm

228
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,250
very important also to change a loss
what they actually though

229
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,730
duplications bits into the Los look
quite

230
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,040
sometimes you can find their very
interesting because tho

231
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,839
specially logging like user names and
passwords just dumping here

232
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,040
little all I'm the next step is by your
own life is so low

233
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,880
to compile the same way as the show into
the duplication

234
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,689
if there's some kind of this cation RV
all such a

235
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,209
you need to check times cited: injection
is this possible to

236
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:28,680
do some kind of for just $15 jack
cheapens the recited somebody's

237
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,839
many Milan wants to own the world you
isolate lease obligation

238
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:36,650
and of course the results wat
interesting part or

239
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,189
Park libraries that or Tom already lying
there are

240
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:40,819
I

241
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:45,180
and the applications using them so you
wanna does the application

242
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,130
know the simplest way is the starting
later arm

243
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,680
wall with a proxy we will show that
you're using on the scene later but the

244
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,508
real device

245
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:58,290
any guesses while this

246
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,430
it's faster exactly see major is quite
it's quite slow

247
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,989
although they say yes if you enable alt

248
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,079
arm trying also

249
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:13,910
graphic art were arm acceleration it
should be okay

250
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,759
because after one conference some guy
approaches that should be better but

251
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,610
we still using the real device because
its little bit faster

252
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:27,740
so you just so lovely cation later
device menu spires four pillars that

253
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,980
work with everyone

254
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,459
Charles to using the arm my quest

255
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:37,829
run application and I just see the logs
domes crashes fires in every that's cool

256
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:41,370
so this is actually what you see if your

257
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,490
no doing a man in the middle or you're
running a proxy

258
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,740
to see that loan application it's an
eagle so

259
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,930
all can somebody gets both

260
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,258
this is

261
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:58,370
make address a while of devised by this
idea

262
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,730
and this is also sent to the more money
sent to the server in this case

263
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,360
why do you think they're using it my

264
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,629
yeah for identification device so you
know which kind

265
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:14,520
device are you so and those are some
other interesting stuff if you want I'll

266
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,689
if you sometimes wanna see what's
actually sent to the server

267
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:23,730
all kind of resolutions and your own
joint versions and

268
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:29,440
to your arm disarm serial numbers and
things like that so you do see

269
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,870
this is the request going so to the
server

270
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,039
and what one what we see

271
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:40,270
that's coming from the server is all
very often we see this

272
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,279
can somebody reduce was actually 730

273
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:47,659
base64

274
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:50,890
Mahmoud contrite but some

275
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,320
you don't get anything it so it's not a
64

276
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,740
but this it drifted off it skated to
change into binary something

277
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,320
now I'm loving mother of applications
are you doing this so if you're going

278
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,639
man in the middle

279
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,559
if you wanna try to meet this it's
almost impossible to do it

280
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,129
right or somebody can do it if somebody
can reduce sandy

281
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,380
the crib it yeah

282
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,260
who yes showed was good

283
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,990
new ruled see okay

284
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,780
today later in the day so are on 3 p.m.
when he gets up

285
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,250
yeah are are you did

286
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,570
over there reason okay great then we
gonna

287
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,730
get him this and you know it's Steve
Watts x2 coming up but

288
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,470
it's really liked to get to know it's
really worked hard to see

289
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,690
and here are some variables here are
just some

290
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,050
words here to some scores here as the
sometimes results it's actually bring

291
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:49,560
back

292
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,480
are they're also kinda other tools that
you could use

293
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,380
I like Dexter it gives you all do let's
say

294
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:02,320
classes the compilation a what kind of
permission services

295
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,370
in all the stock arm so you can

296
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:11,120
easily see what the big Asian dust where
you can use this one promo i think is

297
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,760
from Turkey he won by which

298
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,900
already broken bone which like that

299
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,180
he gets ever think you're just upload a
pic AP K

300
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,670
and you got the sources you covered on
strengths euros

301
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,720
even the net to check that is going on
home

302
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,380
in from the application he's that guy
that actually

303
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,480
are to the home 00

304
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,480
the will play but he was playing with it
so he sent a couple

305
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,440
or AP case where he will play and the
are replacement phone

306
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,960
so he found an ability I'll

307
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,160
otherwise i think is fine he may have
crashed into play if couples times

308
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,700
all are she's really nice guy so you
wanna

309
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,800
he's on Twitter following but

310
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,530
home you must no halt to are

311
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:03,590
read Turk Turkish language or use Google

312
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:09,669
translate okay if you're going for it
now for a static analyzers first that's

313
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,830
why I was asking you

314
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,139
first meet how to read and understand
John Wall called

315
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,380
well you don't have to know all the
classes you just wanna

316
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,280
know a little bit of programming can to
see how they actually done

317
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,470
are with static analyzers you cannot see
they're all replies

318
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,570
while because the application is not
running so you don't see what actually

319
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,560
send to the server and getting back

320
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,240
are and you have quite a few problems

321
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,870
the application is awfully skated some
hola renamed like.

322
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,889
we have been seen before how many of you

323
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,900
can have in your mind to know if you
have like

324
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,980
100 classes which one Jul 01

325
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,720
ATK vacation been named eighty how many
can you can map this kind of relations

326
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,460
you have 180 classes I guess it's really
hard

327
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,760
through to get it in all and makes
glasses bien si yen anbe SEC

328
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,770
so but it's very important for something
analyzes

329
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,340
to identify important things in court so
like what would be

330
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:15,889
important segments from the cold writing

331
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:19,560
yeah communicating to the server writing
to soak HTTP connections sending

332
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:24,500
encryption if there's some below the
activity like Greece if they're used

333
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,830
how the reviews all writing to Los

334
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,129
or someone I'll home

335
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:35,610
really little yeah that's cool ASP like
communication

336
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:41,620
said so. up because like seventy percent
in all seventy eighty percent is most

337
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,570
agree still

338
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,030
thats it's not interesting but sometimes
it is

339
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,370
and then you know it's going to be
showing why we is also some

340
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,419
sometimes important if you're playing
the games life because

341
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,720
know with call in 10 minutes thirty
gives you all do

342
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,710
secrets and Keith and solutions

343
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,990
but it's really nice tho all identify
that important segment so if the

344
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,430
applications as well dump answers like

345
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:12,480
no don't buy it seems that the movement
that started it inside the application

346
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,040
okay so when you're looking at the Asia

347
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,129
analyzing static implications are
looking at the source called

348
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,490
sometime soon in to be feeling like a
piano that

349
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,630
button on the pool are handball

350
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,950
I'm a local ask you if you can help me
to reduce services except from Guam

351
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,050
dog coat minutes from very important all

352
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:39,540
worry well-known slovenian game I'll

353
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,560
and we have been be taken by live and be
so this sucks

354
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,409
I inside the inside the sourcebook can
you ask and somebody gets what they

355
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,330
actually this does

356
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:54,040
who said that he knows how to read Joe
okay

357
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,899
what does it do

358
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,880
yes a okay saving something to the
server right

359
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,140
can somebody guestbook tenu means

360
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,870
you is using and what is T no

361
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,649
no you have ordered

362
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,270
in the in the server name it's like
torture or corals score

363
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,980
yet so this is a score so this is a
score

364
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,290
this is the username Center Server love
to you play the game

365
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,350
this is actually called the server so

366
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,620
how would you Emily this kind call find

367
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:39,360
expected just like this in your lover
and you're the top score of the day

368
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,250
shown it's it's it's really that simple
lights really

369
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:49,070
its welllll I think it's quite high
because things means like

370
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,689
20,000 Katie plays per day

371
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:56,170
so he's we have a little bit calculating
so he

372
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,300
he gets quite a lot of money at the end
of the month

373
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,590
no just pulling the banner some on this
kind of them

374
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,000
gay and if you're not feeling lucky you
know you'd

375
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,830
to get something like this know and some
done so

376
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,669
you don't get the whole day compilation
all from though

377
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,540
don't get the job corps because of the
gdgt who uses

378
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,060
I'll pretty old java Decompiler

379
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,820
to get you get this knowing sometimes
it's really hard

380
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,909
arm hard to read them hard to imagine
what actually

381
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,250
there because she's doing all

382
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,760
and its beside the static analyzer
there's a memorable I will

383
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,570
analyzes we already shown before someone
search angel

384
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,580
traffic with proxy so you a man in the
middle I'm changing what's going back

385
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,629
and forth to the server

386
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,030
if the server all the traffic is not so
let's see

387
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:52,418
obfuscated the cryptids or some kind of
15 then it's fine

388
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:56,890
if you just score sense on me to bring
Dexter but if

389
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,770
to its it's incomplete then you have
part-time there's also the boy Inc

390
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:05,770
but know the bug is kind of know step by
step you know you have to find a way

391
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,740
where to

392
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,380
I'll put the bread break points and no

393
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,650
step 1: boztepe and then i think is that
we are using to go home

394
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,510
it's kind of reflection all who knows
what reflections char

395
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,700
okay someone so what's actually
reflections 0

396
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,740
know it's a language actually its
language ability to inspect the damage

397
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,740
to class

398
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,740
call classes and methods and Vince and
that should do it said

399
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,919
other place at the wrong time so many
applications running

400
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,419
you can call it in actually it's like
John looking job

401
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:41,620
I was like ultimately

402
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,129
what she wants what kind of classes do
we have worked anyway it was we had

403
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:49,850
so what's actually difference between to
Buckingham reflection

404
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:54,020
the reflection we have a high level view
so we have all the classes that we have

405
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,270
to compile all the methods all even
there or

406
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:03,309
their own set to private all protected
to another all

407
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:07,178
attributes that to the methods and the

408
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:10,649
I think which you can you you can change
it all

409
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:14,029
and you can actually what's most most
interesting you that interact with the

410
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:15,210
application in real time

411
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,570
so if you're playing the game on this
poem you naturally

412
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,700
over into tool indirect yes I'll

413
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,750
in real time with the BK shit so we
gonna see how this is

414
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,870
per so there's this is also the other
features so you can access all the

415
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,840
variables

416
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,010
methods change in weather news all

417
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:37,510
we are also using a BB shell all because
it halts

418
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:40,830
love fades to do it because sometimes
you know we're also

419
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,678
we don't have too much time and
sometimes feel so lazy

420
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:47,750
and that's why we use be show well

421
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,250
you can write try to juggle and
compliance

422
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,730
I'll then energy so you don't have to

423
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,190
repackage a BK alright joke 03 package

424
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,519
when it's on and run it but actually you
can are fragile called

425
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,649
and random empty but its best way to
show it

426
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:10,750
after Mike to couples like so why did
you use be shut because it's

427
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,350
jar interpreter all it's free to use

428
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:19,809
it's quite small alright sweet snatch a
scripting language for jobs we have seen

429
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:20,918
other solution

430
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:25,630
all like being on other schools they're
using bite on because I'm

431
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,769
since they using by Tom you need to have
kind of conversion from bite into Java

432
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:34,620
and sending back and forth and using
Java also on the client side that's how

433
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,918
it's much easier and that's why you're
using this binge

434
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:41,100
okay when you analyze the gay she's the
love

435
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:46,019
interesting things in a lightly p.m.
certification pins and system lawls

436
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:50,440
internal IP's are hits the love

437
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,330
occasions that our store all

438
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:59,159
internal IP's there a case and sometimes
even user names and passwords

439
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,130
to do a protected content I love times
you have

440
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,600
like testing cases you know like 15

441
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,370
classis inside the UK because they
didn't clean up before they publish it

442
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:12,949
to the

443
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,400
will play soul just looking at the
source codes you

444
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,220
sometimes not be found really
interesting stuff there okay so we have

445
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:22,900
no

446
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:27,980
sec I'll eyes as we have an amicus
realizes are we should be looking at the

447
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,000
other alters that have been going ground
accomplices in preventing the stuff but

448
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,670
they're really

449
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:37,190
really really wanted some more you know
we would do you want that to happen kind

450
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,300
of run time

451
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,659
all runtime: tool that weakened

452
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,270
change on the application and

453
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:48,710
in real time so team directing real time
clothing methods

454
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,700
arnoldo don't do although very both and

455
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,950
were even create a GD platform

456
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,020
so we gonna show Johal you can

457
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,389
on create one cheating like

458
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:06,310
67 lines of coke something like this you
know I'm

459
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:09,950
application is actually gonna play Halo
itself no

460
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:14,330
so and he'll come in all the time so we
went

461
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,520
really dig deeper then you almost I'll

462
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,539
was feeling desperate because he tried
several methods and

463
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:25,460
on the world but then again who came up
with a big scene and daniel is going to

464
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:25,840
be

465
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,699
telling you more about it selection we
came up with a great deal

466
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,539
i think is rated up what we've seen is
this

467
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,899
pool for dynamical analysis and there
what it does

468
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:41,779
is days under investigation it to the

469
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,859
injects a service included and then

470
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:49,570
next to the service the duplication
besides the service in jackson also be

471
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,049
show

472
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:53,369
and the mean I'm already told what you
jealous

473
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:56,658
this enables enables us the

474
00:29:56,659 --> 00:30:00,299
to you get all the variables at

475
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:05,210
runtime: change them a long some Java
coated wrong time

476
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:11,169
and to do dynamical analysis you can see
there a picture we've seen

477
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:15,809
on the left side is just a modified
duplication with the injected with the

478
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:16,970
service and the

479
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:22,080
I'll be show library at the connection
is established through a TV

480
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,379
tool with its to help move the TCP
protocol

481
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:30,439
and on the right side to conceal seeing
which causes the losing to face the best

482
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,359
cute and

483
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,859
the accompany the this call with my face
changer

484
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:39,908
the best if this actually hard time
seeing the

485
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:42,010
the slow their packaging stall them

486
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:45,860
and solo you can ask me anything about
the

487
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:50,870
the deters I won't go into that because
we want to show you something else

488
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:55,699
so actually watching what what's
possible we'll see needs

489
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,590
I don't know how to say flat Shoals

490
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:04,459
here you can see the user interface

491
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,380
we've seen on the left upper side you
can see

492
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:13,540
all the I objects that are you said
wrong time by the Education

493
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:18,720
on the the other than all

494
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,050
now you can see the activities they are

495
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:26,010
and its automatically during the
activity life cycle management a hundred

496
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,320
and after right clicking with the most
welcome

497
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,340
on sum up the video object will simply
return all the fears that this activity

498
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,179
or lunch

499
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,710
test and their eyesight you have all

500
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:41,190
a view that's cool to watch

501
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,610
waking at some very nervous and monitor
all day are changing during the

502
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,250
execution notification

503
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,550
and blow you it's the scripting part you
can write to the usual state's jobless

504
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,389
or school

505
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:55,920
and they will be executed long time on
the file

506
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,170
all the throwing a vacation so let's do
a demo

507
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:06,250
but the floor I give you the street

508
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,050
the you got it

509
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:17,050
okay let's do it

510
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:30,270
you can see the ball on the site this
project is

511
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:37,270
and no around boxing

512
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,389
be so this is the poor Partha the
provisional %um

513
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:58,280
should be home lungs here because
otherwise

514
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:05,280
so will not it will not work

515
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:13,500
sword

516
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:19,230
working no its or yeah that's the
problem really liked impulse you know we

517
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:19,600
have

518
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,059
fall three films already but we really
want to see

519
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:28,820
we want to show you all in real time

520
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,960
others work all

521
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,740
the something also retrial me for today

522
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,940
0 as the occasionally do

523
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,860
language so in serbia we have all these
which manages

524
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:51,729
is this a not so you can play it body so
although the problem is that there are

525
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,510
only a few users and playing in serbia

526
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:58,658
thank you to actually one for sooo okay

527
00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:03,940
yeah while you use and

528
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,240
really only first way no no is showing
the other

529
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,270
use is subject to a user let's run the
game

530
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,690
but it's quite important we have they
didn't need me

531
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,950
pressuring me and from you all

532
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:21,418
we don't have you didn't know any all do
medium and

533
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:25,408
French words but be over with a the game
every time

534
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:28,740
okay you can see I just click on the

535
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,250
I activity the right the most modern and
the

536
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,500
X you were murdered only all the fields
the deceptive TX

537
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,699
so you can see the feel sorrow

538
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:43,210
and the gold was up a skated the
obviously you have a lot of A's B's and

539
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:43,790
so on

540
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,279
but effecting your own show my thoughts

541
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,440
and do again

542
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,230
the right click also the methods are
displayed and

543
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,300
some are off to skate at but some are
not

544
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,079
and this is interest think and

545
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:06,480
yeah lead with me the whole idea

546
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,720
yeah it was a lot skidded because rather
do is rest of world lol

547
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,029
those methods were above that did this
for us love them

548
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,810
another said it's really good to look
into the the source code

549
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:22,200
and to see if you get DUP of answers
well

550
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,618
can anybody guess what it does a

551
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:29,960
the name of the battles know if its use

552
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,540
but just to see that's merely rear
actually running inside the application

553
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,599
daniel is gonna be

554
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,630
well executing JavaScript

555
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:42,810
no see here so dole's calling up those
make expel Bo

556
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,060
and we gonna see that's actually right
years old you're running at the wrong

557
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,609
time the cation so

558
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:51,740
we can control it totally to know to
call the method still

559
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,680
all but the if you do your static
analysis

560
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,790
you figure out where the answers are
stored so let's bring them out

561
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,490
and watch this and paid to be located

562
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:07,350
and you can see here kansas law all I
have learned

563
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:11,490
Phillies I when I was safe and month
afterwards

564
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,549
everybody's photos no what with their

565
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:18,630
to remove they're getting

566
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,410
yeah okay but if we can do better so
let's

567
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:27,240
sony has imports all weekend you know we
can go the the key point in the game is

568
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,370
to learn how to play the game until he
got the words

569
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:34,839
okay paying I got 10 but

570
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,300
I will execute is don't dance was
murdered and let's see what

571
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:43,710
campus on the left upper parks the game
you can see that this was long

572
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:48,000
you soon we actually know in a bid to
get the answer so we could get up to

573
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,360
eighty

574
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,830
idea at all a where to start

575
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,980
all the negativity or you know

576
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,840
you you get to all things that are here

577
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,940
hollow you should go to trial though do
the worst together to get

578
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:07,090
almost six words than words and the
movies or just call in one min

579
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:11,200
from or we can fall we can make it even
better

580
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,089
since we know that all since we know
that

581
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,440
the answers are stored here weekend
right

582
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,280
1234 670 okay about timelines

583
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,150
call and I'll what does this

584
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:29,530
called dos we get sure the answers

585
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:33,120
although share duo

586
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,540
our answers so here is all possibilities
here are answers

587
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:41,060
so you run and actually delegation

588
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:45,040
of copies the answers to the results
table

589
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,420
and %um all the time so

590
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,760
I have from to get the the solution to
say that

591
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,350
and we need to wait another minutes

592
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:00,000
for the results birds in the meantime I
can show you

593
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,010
that the much you mixing this excluded
because

594
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:08,910
during the less refreshment if I I can
right click on the game to activity for

595
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:09,710
example

596
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,619
the

597
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:11,840
up the

598
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,690
variables that I have been changed
during two left last year's freshmen

599
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,870
have radical or so you spots the

600
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:21,960
edges changes serve

601
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,800
the before so let's wait

602
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,450
mother for two seconds it because it's
really hard to know if in half like

603
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,549
one thousand berry a bill it's really
hard to see

604
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:36,190
what's have been changed or what not but
the dismay

605
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,320
you see that this one has been changed
its fun this farm

606
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,630
all all also you can easily

607
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:47,810
session lutherans Mueller my about the
whole

608
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:52,200
make more visual all

609
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,390
call we are not all loved you need to

610
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:59,650
with connection to Source following
Nations hu J things changing

611
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,910
all Road

612
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:06,850
yeah I make yes it's a it's it's a good
suggestion

613
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,970
we can also be also applied to go into
the

614
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:14,740
the you know if you want to have like
score like 10,000 if you wanna go

310 one point is months result

617
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,859
all and you can see we have to Mark's
school

618
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,220
yes 0 votes mambo home to care for his

619
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,189
it's a winner at the moment so all

620
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:39,120
dude I think your question are we trying
also to going to do

621
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,859
deep to search all the classes all the
methods but their application dissected

622
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,640
going into battle for

623
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,549
yeah because its long both resources
because their not ok so its

624
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:55,680
heap space is a the problem but you can
get a lot of

625
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,750
for interests thanks tho religion or
just inject into the Google

626
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,900
play and but we can show you this little
bit late

627
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:08,160
okay so all that was last year the start
its and play with it

628
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,020
and then do a CCC conference came and in
all

629
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,960
although it's also connected with the
city's the same as both own this song

630
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,990
conferences and we got to be have

631
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:22,859
seem very good presentation from all
calling winner

632
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,120
and he was talking about so darling

633
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,069
dynamic dollar instrumentation but on
different way because now you're

634
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,080
changing KPK

635
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,759
so need to have a BK our ticket on
change it

636
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,780
upload it back to the device or emulator
and run it

637
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:41,450
are and total so we went like

638
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:45,049
he in can be somehow we use his so

639
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:49,460
are his research and so we don't have to
change a PK

640
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,100
so if you're going little bit deeper

641
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:58,339
all I'm into the enjoying system can be
changed show all every so we can thank

642
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:58,740
you

643
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,709
inject into one process into they got
process

644
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,060
on this are ok seem tall and Daniel

645
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:11,310
yes so we came up with a solution we
exchanged some

646
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,700
other males with calling I'll charm
where

647
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,000
thankful he sell and what we do is

648
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,480
using the hijacked his program framework

649
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,900
and hijacking this is Eagle process

650
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,810
and injecting a want to live here is
that we've seen use this

651
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:33,960
and we are actually hooking him do that

652
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,990
unsorted activity so we are checked in
call I bring to it

653
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:41,830
looking dismantled and after a

654
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:45,160
our staff is executed to me

655
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,069
a we proceed with the regional mattered

656
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:53,010
so I will show you another them all

657
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,600
and I'm hero show we hope to be easy it
is

658
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,930
to this earth will see no connect a
digital replay

659
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:07,430
sign this time you actually not changing
a

660
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:11,190
case and more so we're changing movement
all

661
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,660
layers bombs and Android and

662
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:19,339
cookie the all ABA calls and then
injecting the same

663
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,690
overseas services into the are running

664
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:26,630
place fear I have everything in place so

665
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:33,630
let's run the demo

666
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:37,060
them

667
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:41,119
and here his framework is actually a
really stunning

668
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,099
Florida obligation to start so let's run
Play Store

669
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:48,320
and you can see the library has been
injected

670
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:55,320
no let's rock scene

671
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:08,250
and you can hear see that we are on

672
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:12,890
will play and from here now you can do

673
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:18,470
pretty much everyday Inc the would have
seen with this approach you can see here

674
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,600
to the user's name that is

675
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,299
a register to the phone but don't worry
it's fake

676
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,900
yeah although finally really uses

677
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:32,820
were interesting user names and
passwords on Gmail I kissed the bottom

678
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:39,640
so it's actually no I was running inside
the Play Store and we haven't modified

679
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,319
so a BK the same as its came from though

680
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,700
with though the fall and updated though

681
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,660
with us so what we're doing the question

682
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,529
a.m. injection

683
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,280
you know my your and Imperials me know

684
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,230
from and session so all not from
different because you can see the rooted

685
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:04,410
phone that that's a difference between
the

686
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:09,430
do the two methods if you're using pros
and cons over the baby came with doing a

687
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:10,549
can be enjoyed

688
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:13,800
if we have a decade there's no need for
lead to fall

689
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,290
you can do this on on rooted phone AB

690
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,650
all AB needs to be enabled because we
are pushing

691
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:24,080
and to you also hold

692
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,310
or so when I for its

693
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:30,310
that's all there is an issue with
untrusted sources

694
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:34,100
you have to download modifying a blow to
the fall read a BK

695
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:39,279
I'll known only through the phone we do
in 2000 injected directly into Android

696
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,630
although there is no need for a pic a
modification soon just injecting the

697
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,430
runtime

698
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:47,970
up what you need to do to fall and
injected shared libraries and that's why

699
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,649
you need a little bit more skills

700
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:54,270
because it's BAE have been having some
be sure the beginning but because

701
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,990
compiling and no

702
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:59,140
hijacking the native calls when starting
the application

703
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,850
but the it so we so threatened

704
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:07,500
say or true around with the yellow

705
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,940
hey this is a instrument yes

706
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:16,260
this all you can use me have small
growth tall some

707
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,450
face like UK call it's all looks even

708
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:24,710
girl send it to the rhythm SMS messages
you can get a phone is doing something

709
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:25,060
that

710
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,170
with all this kind of call call

711
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,610
like 15 plainly like 20 lifeco

712
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:34,880
and you can some runtime: no don't have
to mission

713
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,740
lash yeah it's actually mission to those
who can play with access to the very

714
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,899
least so that's

715
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,100
FX's along to the on the line only thing
more

716
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,730
you can executed happy great religious

717
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:50,050
longer so that means that there are
changes ahead to know

718
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:53,760
there is 0 possible different kind of
usage

719
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,240
I had been proved it's not only from the
foreign joint

720
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:01,490
I this kind of use it be tested one
client

721
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:05,740
are requested us to test this year to
test oracle forms

722
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,600
have anybody who usess use Oracle Forms

723
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:15,580
well know they're still love that no i i
was also convinced that their desk

724
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,549
because Oracle

725
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:20,650
on all that they gonna be retiring at
but at that moment there's still some

726
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,620
companies developing an Oracle Forms

727
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:26,089
so all we had Oracle Forms

728
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:30,350
broder's for the best think the to it
took us like

729
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:33,440
one day to change it ok see

730
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,150
and actually be injected into the oracle
forms and you're lying inside the World

731
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:37,600
Turns

732
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:42,360
getting all the way it was the same as
enjoy and there are some also kinda

733
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:42,860
quiet

734
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,870
crazy ideas like all I know my son

735
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:50,700
always 12 have me you know that you had
his minecraft

736
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,060
no game when he is playing

737
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,650
someone cares maybe no injected into the
Minecraft the moon

738
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:02,840
his having fun with this kind of RNC
doesn't he

739
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,610
you can create the ultimate CD players

740
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:07,860
multiple you know so we got up now we
gonna see

741
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,950
are we still have one day all all at the
end

742
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,120
for the final them all but you can see
that

743
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,450
this is Saul Saul quite good possibility
so just before the devil

744
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:23,080
some fun hopes it's quite some small
script twelve dollars going to all

745
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,360
written in the group and it's not gonna
be finish more because we have other

746
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,160
things to do

747
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,359
are but it's only get up you you've got
the URL you can

748
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:37,480
to take it played its are sent the email
loro some suggestions

749
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,770
and two can help testers note right
sometimes cases the best duplication

750
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:48,500
IOM Packers cheaters and this is in the
open for suggestions from

751
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,620
comments and things like that soul are

752
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:57,210
since we have been in August all we have
been doing our presentation also also at

753
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:58,070

to see and you will get

760
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:20,300
you will see how all game developers in
all

761
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,600
sometimes missus or sometimes my

762
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,900
they're missing some things because
they've really want to optimize

763
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:34,900
or making make their life much more
easier

764
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,769

ok even help me because I i suck it

766
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:52,849
lecture so well-rounded education

812
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,940

813
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,710
on you dread and I'm displaying

814
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:52,150
this this variable which is starting and
some

815
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,710
some game at PGE some things like that

816
00:51:55,710 --> 00:52:00,270
and just printing it out and below that
I am

817
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:05,110
replacing the card to this that is
actually drawn to the

818
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:10,010
to the user interface so nothing special
here and here I'm sleeping

819
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:13,940
existing concert so actually they say

820

821
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,430
upbringing that's me enables you to win
although

822
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:25,450
all the game would at least you would
have a better chance for

823
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:30,290
for many no it's not that complicated
just let no have to on all
