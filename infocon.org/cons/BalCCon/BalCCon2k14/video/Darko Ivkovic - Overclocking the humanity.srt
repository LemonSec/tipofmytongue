that

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:21,020
well West

air whatever care to hide

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,180
a let me introduce the next lecture the
cream you could reach

5
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,720
and overclocking the community the
science of cycles reveals

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,830
future tense to go think

7
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,470
thank you all for coming here

8
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,650
today BO bol Kong to be with us

9
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,070
2005 a new insights new ideas

10
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,000
new ways to solve the problems

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,580
defied the better way of relieving

12
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,920
dissident

13
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,030
a this is lecture

14
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,340
or blocking the humanity decisive
seichas reviews future trance it's a

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,310
little bit different from another
lectures that you heard

16
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,700
in this 2-3 days we have more speak
about consciousness

17
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,290
about two things that we can do it
practicality

18
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,770
to improve your life to improve our
daily life

19
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,899
a in this lecture we should try raising
awareness

20
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:38,270
on some fundamental truths of life and
get to idea on how to fully leave

21
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,630
our potential 400 own benefit

22
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,560
and benefit or or human cracked a

23
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,490
beer they examine few ideas most of us
here

24
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,570
present are working with computers

25
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,250
our programmers web designs and song
a.m.

26
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,469
a programmer programme ce a resident of
our given application controlling many

27
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:04,270
device of

28
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,019
or technical systems have you

29
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,220
every managed that if it's all

30
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,510
if you're good in programming computer
programming in device programming book

31
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,179
the source devices program and songs in
song

32
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,970
if not this much easier

33
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,100
impossible to program and reprogram your

34
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,810
own life this pressure stink

35
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,260
I think mitch spoke

36
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,709
a lot about this and I will

37
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,820
Wally this further on this topic

38
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,190
today you're sure learned how to a very
simple

39
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,700
reprogram your life and create new
programming in writing

40
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,170
of you or the future the

41
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,339
these few ideas are very new

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,750
and I don't ask you to believe me

43
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,810
after I make the speech but I N cottage
ooo

44
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,380
to examine the to find your troops

45
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,170
not to take the truth that

46
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:16,089
army the app mainstream media given to
us another thing sell second think

47
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,260
reveals they have been the foundation of
science of psychosis

48
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:26,120
and reveal its significance I should
provide you with some predictions

49
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,480
on pure essence problem with any offence
future

50
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,609
influencing our daily lives this
prediction is

51
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,870
can serve us for better preparation for
the future I am

52
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,030
the show also and light the essence

53
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,690
or out into data on internet

54
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,390
as an appearance and essence of its role
in the history of mankind

55
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,890
be sure see why it master be duty

56
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,220
of each of us every one of us to commit
ourselves

57
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,730
to the cause of 3

58
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,810
internet or

59
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,340
at least some minimal protection of
private we spoke a lot of progress in

60
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,200
Internet

61
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,609
we also show today in this short story

62
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,989
discover how each one of you can help

63
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:20,060
minimize the number of conflicts in the
world

64
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,900
sounds a little bit strange yes

65
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,000
how to minimize decaf the number of
politics in this world

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,680
which you also resolute and the same
time in many

67
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,640
foot boat for the increasing your
lifestyle you will have

68
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,090
better life quality

69
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,830
the question is how is this possible in
case you forgot let me remind you how

70
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,530
truly power for you or

71
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,770
in shaping your ice in the lives of the
community issue living

72
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,870
cast a wary in quantum physics

73
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,020
hearsay rust or use it shootings

74
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,430
some all other guys here

75
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,660
probably among us

76
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,990
my remember the great action of
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi that was for

77
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:14,200
two or three decades in which he called
to a lot of people to meditate is for

78
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,229
the workpiece

79
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,700
about onto

80
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,960
Bure I will not ask you to meditate
today

81
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,729
we will speak on them

82
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:30,770
metres them more more simple because all
great things are

83
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:37,770
essentially simpering in nature in on a
trip

84
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,340
of this issue Lords about me

85
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,409
I had some I worked a lot with be

86
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,039
business intelligence system and
knowledge management system that was

87
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:49,860
interesting

88
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,639
thing for me to combine them softer the
hell a pink and work with people

89
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,380
also was a have many years experience

90
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,810
on market to national markets

91
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,300
to improve softer international markets

92
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,340
to predict shoot remorse on these
markets

93
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,770
I signed the using astrology

94
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,889
business astrology mare the defense your
sis

95
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:24,060
to find out my way to rice and

96
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,300
welcome cool this aren't

97
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,949
cost most cosmos

98
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:34,860
is a Greek word and means accordance

99
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,520
order higher money its opposite this
chaos

100
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,099
emptiness the name for calm so most
itself

101
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:47,169
implies that there is some kind of order

102
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,729
some kind of role which make us

103
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:54,630
saw that between the smallest in the
biggest part so the cost must exist some

104
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,680
kind of order in connection

105
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,729
more than terry's of

106
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:03,639
holographic space universe justified the
very

107
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,150
Ward cost Moss poor

108
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,719
all the course missus perpetual motion
and vibration

109
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:15,870
molting celebrating everything vibrates
in Morse

110
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,030
everything is one on one higher-level

111
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,320
a astrology

112
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,440
is the old entiende science of cycles

113
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,160
and perhaps the most as a subject

114
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,960
%uh so in a way most ignored today

115
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,849
the root of Astro dreary can find the
route

116
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:47,850
in the past but owing on the straw he
was the first organized system has

117
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,640
torigians

118
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,930
are rising about second millennium

119
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,770
before Christmas there is a speculation
that the store just some kind

120
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,289
appear this million period the third
millennium before pieces but

121
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,380
these only to the defense fashioned said
I strains me is dated to this period are

122
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:08,780
not

123
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,380
will see their have sufficient evidence
to demonstrate that

124
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,920
one integrated theory of a strong urge
what this

125
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,080
interesting today for us something
that's called procession

126
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,039
of the Equinox I felt where you can see
with this

127
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,680
a session affecting us is a movement of
the earth

128
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,189
due to slow but continuous change Korean
tation of

129
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,580
axis rotation in relation to

130
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:46,580
ideas fear of excess Starz the Earth's
axis

131
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,050
is traveling between 12

132
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,390
stages or the akc in about 25

133
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,069
thousand years twitches on

Orem ruling Mauer less than 26,000 years
which is

135
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,529
wage stepped through a side thinks about
2,200

136
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:12,170
sixty years that PC takes

137
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,819
these 25 manhunt twenty years

138
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:22,399
for a writ access to complete one while
bro survey or proper circle

139
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,880
we called this year these great yar

140
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,230
55 bit intense had 26 thousand years

141
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:34,149
great ER or platonic your in this very
important this is why I'm

142
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:38,529
this 2 10 biggest cycle snowing in the
strong army

143
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:45,529
in universe

144
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,510
and that the cycle

145
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,590
we can't divide the cycling fans parts

146
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,780
every parts give us a big

147
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,699
age about about two thousand years

148
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,090
and we can imagine first the first age

149
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:10,090
that icky speak slowly here is HBT is
6900 before priestess in 4700 before

150
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,890
priestess

151
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,699
that was the age of communication and
writing

152
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,650
this great %eh is associated with it

153
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,650
evolution a quarter in a vast amount of
species

154
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,890
deem main idea was sharing ideas in
treating

155
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,330
another era was

156
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,830
era of Egypt egypt was in his highest
level

157
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:41,280
that was each towers the main board was

158
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:48,280
control for it to agriculture in the in
these age of towers agriculture was

159
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,210
discovered

160
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:54,360
the big pyramids is built and song a
song you can see

161
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,290
the quick summary what was important the
CH

162
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:03,120
at the goal for their a job various
stuff 'cause

163
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,280
between 2,500 before peace this entry

164
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,829
three hundred years before Christmas
that was the time of

165
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,920
Kong Korea conquerors and warriors

166
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,630
the Warriors grueling

167
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,050
the world and a lot of countries

168
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:25,370
in Europe Asia African song after that
we have

169
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,460
new-age and I'm I roll

170
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,710
the age of pieces begins with two

171
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,490
the hand that years before priestess
until

172
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:41,120
90 s and us 90 said three and in this
period we know

173
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,410
that was a period of a lot of organize
their religion Christianity another

174
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,130
religion

175
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,939
but that was also do it

176
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,660
a drive crews eights increase Ishan

177
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,650
on song and then they are coming to our
present era

178
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,150
it's very interesting the Age of
Aquarius your current a lot of %uh about

179
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,110
this topic

180
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,520
and these H begin

181
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,050
a tenth nineteenth century and the real
health

182
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,310
along along ideal tree

183
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:19,500
thousand tears in the eighty agent of
Aquarius

184
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,160
is a Jew with discovery SBC this last
had the tears

185
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,740
big big discoveries percent disagree
with Russian

186
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:34,400
investor evolution the dish changes so
be so quick we cannot imagine it's

187
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,329
we cannot understand how how quick

188
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,420
or two things happened we have two big
war since on

189
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,490
me vent to mean

190
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,290
marist's we sent our ports

191
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,319
and the end of the universe to brute on
for other

192
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,410
in these ages also

193
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,060
interesting because we love near see

194
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,239
that in these H the do that the
individuality each of us will be

195
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,120
stronger

196
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,270
this the big trent but the border
between the sexes feel diminished

197
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,750
military every year the munition

198
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,040
because the energy all these

199
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,219
a roo the sage has no camera

200
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,330
the general thoughts

201
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,019
are

202
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,740
and light mint individual freedom

203
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:34,170
and we have internet today that's not
too that's possible to see

204
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,209
but we will have also a lot of course
because all the wars

205
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,399
these two wars was begin in this

206
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,380
era what's more all sent interesting

207
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,000
human life cycle me

208
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,190
try to understand human life cycle bhi
kabhi bhi we begin the two first

209
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,760
brecht first Brett moment East more
important than

210
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,939
conception back why

211
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:07,529
many can ask why is this

212
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:11,019
it's because a child in the period from
conception until birth

213
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:14,149
makes up us and biotic organism with
mother

214
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:17,970
that carries in here warm and has no
autonomy not

215
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,230
all out on me it's Brett this and he
eats

216
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,420
through its mother which is a whole
universe for it and only

217
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,160
in the very moment of driving infers
Brett the baby starts

218
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,920
its autonomous existence on earth in the
child is staking

219
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,719
burt it chooses the planets and stars
and the moment at which it will be born

220
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,870
it's not opposite the child

221
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,240
and the mother in fact

222
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,020
shoes subconsciously the moment which is
the impurity this harmony with the

223
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,790
Trident

224
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,290
me to sing biggest and greatest

225
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,640
resonates with the tries destiny which
will provide it

226
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,100
for the biggest survivor China's and
today we love the most of his potentials

227
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,370
the cosmos and the men

228
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,829
are connected on multiple levels

229
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,709
a more comprehensive approach to the
subject

230
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:21,729
for surface is the limit so this lecture
so it shows there a single example

231
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,760
we can demonstrate this single
mathematical Court Graffik

232
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,089
overlapping of importance cyclists
import men

233
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:31,640
and a great the caustics ok in this case
big

234
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,189
year me so the little bit

235
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,100
miss the breading remit the rhythm

236
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,450
albrecht is funneled most important
clocks for our

237
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:47,450
humans one can survive without food for
weeks without what their 40s

238
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,380
but when the British Cycling's distort
and broken that comes in a minute

239
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,210
or few minutes it's america's that
number of

240
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:01,140
brecht human mark because most it sick

241
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,400
it grow into the number of years in a
great Mike across the Great America see

242
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,870
how above dot pillow

holes that

245
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,940

Ian Britt out very minute itself
coverage

247
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,430
I which measure so it follows

248
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:32,579
the slow small-company Asian big a c18

249
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,610
Brett's and 60 minutes to 1 hour 24
hours give the exact

250
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,610
25,000 920 preteen in Berthoud

251
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,960
Verde it is exact the number of view

252
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,440
number all viewers in the great here

253
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,440
this is not accidental we can ask why
it's such a resonance between number of

254
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,910
complex human britt

255
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,780
in a day and number of years in the
grittier why these exist

256
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,990
perhaps because we live in a cost more
so in the

257
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,640
you can remember cost missus or their

258
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,730
harmony and accordance

259
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,900
and because clinton is this are not Sol

260
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,839
credential

261
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,859
be dog or of big my aunt believe that
every star

262
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:31,510
every planet and there is something
light give us unique vibration tote

263
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,070
its movements and his travel in space
when you're born

264
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,178
the melody that this creates by

265
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:42,990
tuning on the Starz in that time its

266
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,750
inscribed on your mind in its freshest
most

267
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,179
and so them most and sophisticated and
more sensitive State

268
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,200
the state deal birth through your life

269
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,409
this will cause your health or your
illness

270
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:02,770
in your life isn't human video origin
musical harmony

271
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,620
that exists is the time through birth to
be in your healthy

272
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:11,489
and then or you're tuning with the
fundamental musica how many breaks down

273
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:18,440
you become ill in this connection
process has done very significant words

274
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,240
he would not

275
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:26,179
prescribed medicine to a patient until
she had seen his astrological birth

276
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:30,169
trapped and the it is a surprising think
that

277
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:33,770
after having examined the passion built
by a truck bro tell us what could

278
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,549
patients

279
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:39,049
who had confused other physicians
successfully

280
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:43,360
patience who could not be cured by any
another

281
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,389
physician Hughes it to say then until I
know

282
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:54,419
the position all the stars at the time
with this man births

283
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,740
it's not possible to know the no sew
fleece

284
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,809
in the Harmony and unless a knoll

285
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:07,809
the harassment of this inner harmony how
can I make this man had to in everyday

286
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:09,879
life

287
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,980
the timing seems willing they are to us
like a line

288
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:18,190
what does means

289
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,150
that's running from the past to the
present moment into was the future

290
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,810
its haha

291
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,950
somehow implies that there is no rid no
return Inc

292
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,090
moments more it only thinks but our
asses stores

293
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:40,060
and them acid civilization day seems to
know all

294
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,889
something more because

295
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,230
DSS oh no civilization can

296
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,420
kept the knowledge on the fact that
stymies

297
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,660
of a cycling the street or better yet

298
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:00,640
to say spiral in the truth like corn
will bring their simple motion

299
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,970
time is like spiral like our date in the
day in a spiral

300
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,340
is a picture of time how we

301
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,850
develop our life in time it's not

302
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,428
accident

303
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:21,880
is by Morsi seichas it means that
they're our song

304
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,299
protest that they're accusing the
specific moments of time

305
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:28,730
repetition of same or similar offense

306
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,380
creates the possibility of the
prediction

307
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,450
in marginal moving up to eighty-six
percent

308
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,309
if you wish to know the future you have
to know

309
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:45,350
the best because the future course not
think that has no seething the best

310
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:49,570
do all untested think

311
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:55,220
golden test the scene sees

312
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,820
the one who does know its history is
doomed to repeat

313
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,010
there is a small sink

314
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,399
from Nikola Tesla big mind pussies

315
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:09,959
one of the present degree of mankind
evolution in which there is more

316
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,770
awareness

317
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,399
of historical occurrences and their
cosmological cause this

318
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,860
ok rationale shakes are still natural
even more

319
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,830
fierce battle Shelby fault between the
East and the West

320
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,889
new can see that whilst 20th December
1914

321
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:33,890
that wasn't I most big more

322
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,630
now we can't use some of global
predictions and UV go to another

323
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,559
question

324
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:51,090
global predictions given from a science
a cycle are saying curfew

325
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,459
interesting thinks first thing

326
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,659
capetown of number of workplaces bc it

327
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:04,820
every year and these integration of
extreme decline of many states

328
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,389
in our we last until 20

329
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:12,669
23 thats and big process and the

330
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:17,090
you can think about it and see that it's
better to create your won't drop

331
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:24,090
your own company your own factory
because there is not just seek your

332
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:29,449
drop you cannot think

333
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,600
I will find it because this crisis.
Israel

334
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,860
of order and cute aunty transitory

335
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:40,760
another thing until 2018 we'll have a
treat

336
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,309
or Great War me Ceto now crane and so on

337
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:47,750
what happens on the Middle East but

338
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,620
big Laurel not happen because the
general tendency would be to control

339
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,850
local horse

340
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,809
to give it's more about the real see
another small or so

341
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:00,460
calming in different part of the earth

342
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,029
and the 13 it's important that period
from

343
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:10,419
2018 to 2026 is a period the very
dangerous toward peace

344
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:14,039
for monetary system big banks

345
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:20,419
the more banks will collapse beloved
cease to exist as a currency

346
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:24,899
richer pay to rate changes

347
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:28,250
to come open doors to warn allies
conflict that means we

348
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:33,550
should do something every of us should
do something

349
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:37,710
dude something bad there for our loved
ones

350
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,730
also for the community and for or

351
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,970
world then we go all

352
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:49,020
slowly to practical part a little bit
too

353
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,160
hourly basic knowledge

354
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,260
about the brainwave say I hope you'll
know something

355
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:59,150
and we come to

356
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,410
topical this team overclocking blowouts
clock rate

357
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:08,480
overclocking and bring race i think is
the most of us here now this stinks

358
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,130
the clock rate it typically a first for
the frequency

359
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:16,820
a teacher CPU is running central
processing unit in every computer

360
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:22,820
its measurement inherits and
overclocking

361
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,060
is process of making a computer a
component operate faster than the clock

362
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,899
frequency

363
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,290
specified by the manufacturer by
modifying system paramedics

364
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:35,460
most overclocking techniques

365
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,590
increase power consumption its normal

366
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,810
general use more heat

367
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:47,870
which must be disbursed if the trip is
to remain operational

368
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:53,409
the purpose of lower parking is to
increase the operating speed of giving

369
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,420
however the trade-offs

370
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,040
re: increasing power consumption fan
noise

371
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,280
this is thing can become unstable if the
AP police

372
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,360
overlook too much at the risk of damage

373
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,929
due to excessive or altered Rohit

374
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:16,430
generation in extreme cases costly and
complex cool Inc

375
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:22,100
is required in can solve the problem but
we will not speak up all up to

376
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,199
or clocking in computer on wheels you
are going few

377
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,120
forgive we can ask us together

378
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:36,059
what is the clock similar clock love the
man

379
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,879
was the frequency of the CPU in our
brain

380
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,090
Bri Mason human

381
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:46,059
can be categorized in according to the
papers in four main

382
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:51,020
categories use can see it here your day
with top

383
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:56,750
house ideal for parents steadfast 14-8
ERC out of our

384
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:03,750
8 active both parents and better what
they can say about this

385
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,650
thinks delta waves

386
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,549
the first mate delta wave very slow the
most lawyers

387
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:16,260
wave or the rain is specific for state
of a dreamless

388
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,309
deep sleep we have more not really
conscious

389
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:22,530
pep talk waves

390
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:29,530
number two are characteristic for a
dream state

391
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,830
next third state of mind

392
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,760
they also vase are specific for state
between

393
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,970
this state of being awake and dream
states mostly being associated with the

394
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,080
phase been here

395
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,610
just our way why walk but not complete

396
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,479
or those moments we r falling asleep

397
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,970
a thousand phase

398
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,830
it's grown ups on those they are
experiencing meditation

399
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:01,669
because when the arrow getting or there
we have a problem

400
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:05,030
to got to the south of a zone B

401
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:08,149
aware or think something in this phase

402
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,800
it's a very difficult to be dear in the
present more then we have a

403
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,159
out someplace

404
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,580
what's interesting that's a brief if
anxious

405
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:23,550
simply saved on Fri most in the
frequency that this close to the H

406
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,250
especially by children that means the
chilled the

407
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,060
to his brain mean that tried this meet
at age five

408
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,110
often works on these five carrots

409
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:40,050
with six year what two more to six here
since all on Songz new SOP

410
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,399
it every year with children age

411
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,840
or twenty-year Bethenny's or

412
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,740
these border 0 throw parrots also vase

413
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,220
many memorize the UN's from

414
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,450
early childhood remain tight to rule
over

415
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,920
frequencies which the mind can hardly
reach

416
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,180
in later years without descending

417
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,530
to sleep state in meet NTS 30 s

418
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:11,889
you have a problem menu slow your
brainwaves

419
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,530
from bathtub you say about better more

420
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:19,990
this normal normal state of mind now
when we are speaking

421
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,840
together when you're going from from vet
that two of our

422
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,080
we are more relaxed and so on

423
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,159
be controlled this this delta V issue
kissy

424
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,220
a little bit more in de Paris

425
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,190
this range a to march of

lean ability to read through anybody

428
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,480

tiptoe vase

430
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,079
when we have Vinyard too much

431
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,320
intent that than we are yeah for
emotional awareness and

432
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,059
stress and meow sleeping now optimal we
have creativity emotional connection

00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:09,269
with another people

434
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:13,539
we have strong intuition in varying

I am also may see the seat

438
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:30,349
this is the moderate part eight to 12
harrods

439
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:34,809
this team testing because we have in
this RGB have this

440
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:37,999
division in twelve parts

441
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:41,759
the D&D here we have 12 hats

442
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,809
until we are coming toll normal daily
life

443
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:48,979
3 console our brain in the

444
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:52,079
up I actually have tells Mary the and
that these

445
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,940
its it's not accidental there was a lot
a lot

446
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,999
natural seen the Sphinx am

447
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:04,979
what increases South Ave SPC alcohol in
my view on our I like sound so mounted

448
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:07,149
episode in this special iraqi I

449
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:10,629
team about me first thrives

450
00:30:10,629 --> 00:30:14,668
after with Rocky a party will see it is
this

451
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:20,019
right or wrong them back to me is the
better races

452
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:24,199
most known better this is pretty from
almost a ten-year

453
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:27,589
awake when we were thinking you are
analyzing your

454
00:30:27,589 --> 00:30:30,889
more idk Ingersoll during got it wrong
and song

455
00:30:30,889 --> 00:30:37,789
this is the most so-called normal state
of mind so

456
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:43,379
want to see if this thing that brings
home crowd to put a simple

457
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,040
mmm we have experience it in every child
support

458
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,620
already thinks from a time becomes and
cautious

459
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:55,899
for us in later years in this very hard
to reach

460
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:00,650
we go for dinner

461
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,210
planet Earth has also he's

462
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:08,170
residence internet a residence or 530
East

463
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:14,060
about a terrace this theorem this is so
courtroom on the resonance

464
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,760
is very interesting

465
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,990
for example n shit Indian Rishi's in you
have the Saints in India

466
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:26,230
be called the up on with this frequents
the storm

467
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:29,330
that we heard a lot movie scene

468
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:34,189
books and so on data solitary level

469
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:37,500
in accordance to abbreviate type
division is on the ready

470
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,070
and drove step back and out of our range

471
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:44,659
we concede then we are coming back

472
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:50,220
eight to 12 his seed and many have kept
them apes test

473
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,750
8 and from eighty got 212 has

474
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:59,870
the the very isolation of the planet

475
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:05,330
we're helping the fashion in now for
state the frequent 32 beating conscious

476
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,360
and unconscious

a similar thing is happening globally
with the humanity squalid divine Qantas

517
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,069
or was what was earlier I'm conscious

518
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,070
for trying to push way out

519
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:18,190
from this dark part of our being

520
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,140
into compliance and we must be prepared

521
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:29,140
and they are not prepared that we have a
lot of trouble nature and social

immutable synergy introduced 15 do you
go on their minds

524
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:39,109
if the state so overclocking what I mean

525
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:42,420
in this term or clocking is that these

526
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,540
frequencies where it peaked changing ang

527
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:51,500
conflicts in the world more aggressive
battle for survival of

greater control from Big Brother fear of
losing a job

529
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,310
all these things bring more stress

530
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:05,850
and then sick of time the feeling like
time miss morris dancing fans

531
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:09,830
overclocking the humanities shipping
thought accelerate

it's an abortion it has his purpose

533
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,500
and in accordance to change in the big
your

534
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,060
25 1900 twenty years

535
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,830
it's happening in this time

536
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:28,090
now in here with us together

537
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:34,240
the one cannot follow the change which
will happen the next day cats

538
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,759
will suffer mentally or physically
through illness

539
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,980
which both have their cause

540
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,060
the disc or the soul

541
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,870
you should get into this but the snoop
farthing

542
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:53,870
and reprogram our lives accordingly

543
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:02,380
yes makes passion is how to program the
program our lives

544
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:05,780
because we are all would be in
programming computer

545
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,950
making use of to renew weed or games so
I don't know which way the game is now

546
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:15,640
the most loom we are keen on okay

547
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,120
but how to program our lives how

548
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,569
Kiwi can we change not this most
important

549
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:26,750
our life the biggest

550
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:31,330
art computer and the biggest
programmable substance

551
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:35,590
on the planet is the water there is a
lot

552
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:39,760
a lot experiments in you can find within
you want to find it you can find it on

553
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,520
the internet

554
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,040
but please don't read on the mainstream
Adrienne's

555
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,040
takes the things from them

556
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,820
as a granted please to in on y'all

557
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,130
mine and examine try alt

558
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:59,330
see one or another alternative see
what's right

559
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:03,330
on the what's wrong water

560
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:08,990
commerce majority of our planet the r60
until eighty percent of made the water

561
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:13,160
that the pencil follow each water has a
lot of

562
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,970
alt caressed characteristics its final
Dorries substances which

563
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:22,069
expansive import it's not normal for a
substance in this

564
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:27,240
opposite many of you experience for all
be

565
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,229
correct book lists in the freezer and
then

566
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:37,900
it has been proved that its structure or
what they remember the Xperia sit at

567
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,480
past you can find the a lot of

568
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,080
experiments they can pruitt but not
that's

569
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,259
that's not all that's not all

570
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,500
there is interesting very interesting
guy I Japanese

571
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,750
guy Musallam want of skill I hope a lot
of

572
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:02,000
you heard about him and there is a lot
of things on YouTube on the Internet

573
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,820
a musalo mata has published in testing
results from experiments very he proved

574
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,180
that

575
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,339
water remembers bought

576
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:17,690
our thoughts in the formation it came
into contact with it

577
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,830
in this Sat your party can also

578
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:24,710
that water can take

579
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:28,960
our tolls as a medium

580
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,680
like like

581
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:38,339
drive like computer

582
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:42,749
a mainstream science normally put it

583
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:46,288
into question because of most societies
are being

584
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:50,229
found that the by multinational
corporations such a fun with them so

585
00:39:50,229 --> 00:39:53,718
in this is which have no interest that
people should know

586
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:58,019
simple procedures and the formation
which could enable them to take

587
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:03,598
or were they lives do not tell them I
think the trust those who have complete

588
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,279
control with Misty maybe I say another
time

589
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:10,849
make an effort to get close to the true
that he is said to free

590
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:15,339
oh there is another example for isn't in
Christianity

591
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:18,449
and ever seen its conceptual

592
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:23,680
has the story some boasting effect of
holy water the water that receives a

593
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,399
prayer

594
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,969
it's something different other than
numerous experimental residence

595
00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:32,949
from model practical application of that
knowledge givers

596
00:40:32,949 --> 00:40:36,910
abuse you are cutting edge technology
that one which

597
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:40,680
and the pursuit through consummation of
both programmed water

598
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,118
to program your thoughts for longer
periods of time

599
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,709
your Billys and processes in your or
organism

600
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:53,839
it's a very strong it's taken a little
bit time

601
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,609
it's very strong you should try there is
not costs

602
00:40:57,609 --> 00:41:00,779
its interesting it's open source it

603
00:41:00,779 --> 00:41:05,039
its open-source um

604
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:08,209
that this is simply Pat

605
00:41:08,209 --> 00:41:11,689
of tired if last one's subconscious
hadn't the

606
00:41:11,689 --> 00:41:17,499
if three samples out the hip tosses for
example only hear views water as a

607
00:41:17,499 --> 00:41:18,218
material

608
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:22,179
carry it awesome it suggests became care
didn't suggestion

609
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:26,019
with succession in water put it in what

610
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:29,519
let us leave for a while and what about

611
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:32,660
I kinda do too tool search

612
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:38,190
a little bit more about my solemn oath

lotta love lost they have put in the
food itself

635
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:06,630
family is very more healthy and more

636
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:10,200
I'm it'll to Davie all eat

637
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,600
in Fort

638
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,180
alone separated

639
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,270
forgetting their family lunch is all
about

640
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:26,770
try doing the amount to experiment with
rice it's a very interesting can be seen

641
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,509
on YouTube

642
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:31,490
you put it Macedonia Malta experiment
with the rise

643
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:36,560
it you can easily repeat in your kitchen
that can be your own experiments

644
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,860
don't listen to both mainstream and they
make your experiment and see what the

645
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,100
truth

646
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:48,470
the Inc this experiment 14 it be
different emotions

647
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:54,810
get charger shocking me at shockingly

648
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:59,520
keen another way checked this please

649
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,670
don't take for granted I will show you

650
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:07,670
I small think from a model

651
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:14,670
what and what about us doctor and want
to expose music or spoken wars type it

652
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,370
pictures in the dust water

653
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:24,370
after it was crest allies the waters
this post must truly majestic

654
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:29,100
Bekasi few things here first good

655
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,270
emotions put it in the water and freeze

656
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:37,720
this emotional blow then thank you

657
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,109
and you will see how

658
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:46,810
reach form has a bath salts in motion
then love and appreciation

659
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:50,370
bias

660
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:57,370
nice crystal for happiness

661
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:07,400
truth

662
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,130
and then crystalline water from Lake
after pray offering

663
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:16,290
for both annual see how is what though

664
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:19,740
before the play before offering a prayer

665
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:24,098
is totally newest

666
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:31,099
his structure done more mother teresa

667
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:47,390
he he

668
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:53,660
you add the dolts you make me sick guy
who kill you

669
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:58,589
but went up no symmetry

670
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:05,590
no really more damage now sold

671
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:13,480
%uh the Hitler

672
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:20,480
this image come out from the water then
Gretzky

673
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:32,869
man simply taking holy water

674
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:40,440
done more peace

675
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,329
the difference is so big you pukin dogs
say anything

676
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:48,510
then batons Pastora give us

677
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:55,510
this form on water on amazing grease

678
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:05,310
than de Mon you see how nice

679
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:11,100
this game looks so and I'm off to expose
it a try

680
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:18,100
and an anger

681
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,670
you see it's clear the difference

682
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:27,000
what

683
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,250
is memorized in water and

684
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,490
his thoughts can do that to water and we
are

685
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:41,000
60 70 80 percent a water can imagine
what our thoughts came to class

686
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,630
menu seeing yeah I can not do it this
then your program in your water

687
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:50,910
in your body not to be possible

688
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:57,910
to achieve song some tea

689
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,710
mmm

690
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:10,980
area here and what took

691
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:15,140
yeah a how you came

692
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:19,670
do with this programming there is no
fuel race

693
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:24,170
you can speak to the water you can

694
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:28,550
put the water tho extension music

695
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:34,220
you can pray but you can write something
on the glass

696
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,669
all water and after did this is

697
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:40,740
this was for me amazing I strike some
experiments

698
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,740
but I saw that thats

699
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:47,729
like seed you should

700
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:51,480
made your own experiments and see what
is the truth

701
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,460
I'm you can do this put back glass
bottle field

702
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,950
with water to stand in the Sun for some
time

703
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:04,129
to take energy from the Sun and insert
your thoughts

704
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:08,280
and vicious me a piece of paper now try
to program

705
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,460
to do what entrap

706
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,740
I tried to meet up my plans on the
balcony

707
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:17,910
that was amazing I treated

708
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:21,170
two-piece of plants with these water

709
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:25,140
and other plans to meet another water
that was the same people

710
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:29,210
plants in the in one month but was
amazing the difference vez a big

711
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:32,800
but you should tracked you should see

712
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,050
alone I said not to believe to me what
they split

713
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:40,940
for more information or item us I D
Amato

714
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:44,750
in there is a lot of stinks lot of
things and in turn in to YouTube you can

715
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,010
see you read it

716
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:50,550
see the pictures firm interesting
experiments and song

717
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:55,670
additional argument concerning the
memory of the water is for example como

718
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:56,190
party

719
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:59,840
home yet but the is based on a member of
the water

720
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:05,750
it caps curing a lot of people today

721
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:08,630
but it's problematic for big

722
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:12,549
in this the fireman they don't have and
then they're not get it

723
00:50:12,549 --> 00:50:16,150
for corporation the

724
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:20,530
home ok but the help securing a lot of
people at many we think there is no real

725
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:21,359
work there

726
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:25,279
home a party that's probably just
placebo effect

727
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,010
but what shall we do with this fact

728
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:32,049
that come up at: successfully treated
any must all

729
00:50:32,049 --> 00:50:35,730
can you say that what

730
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:40,329
any mild and placebo effect any amount
should not know

731
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:45,549
anything about placebo effect
intelligent man finds this enough for

732
00:50:45,549 --> 00:50:46,740
for the research

733
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:50,439
I hope you have some it took so my this

734
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:55,180
her what this collective unconscious

735
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,960
it's interesting crash we spoke a little
bit about

736
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,049
collective unconscious and i think is
important talk

737
00:51:02,049 --> 00:51:05,380
to review it collective unconscious is a
term from

738
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:09,049
of analytical psychology going at Barker
room

739
00:51:09,049 --> 00:51:13,650
car was the view it's a part of the
unconscious mind expressed

740
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:17,440
inhumanity and or lifeform sleep

741
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,460
never systems like we and discuss how
the strep throat this

742
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:26,690
psyche out comical organist experience
younger distinguished

743
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:30,200
the collective unconscious from the
press along conscious

744
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,819
in that the press along conscious is a
personal reservoir of experience

745
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:39,980
unique to each if the adult why the
collective unconscious collects and

746
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,069
organize those personal experience

747
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:46,549
in a similar way with each member of
particular species

748
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:50,450
man-woman sauce piece/pieces animal
species some song

749
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:56,339
there is an interesting effect with name
the 100 Mike effects

750
00:51:56,339 --> 00:52:00,299
some scientists are conducted the study
of

751
00:52:00,299 --> 00:52:03,569
mccracken monkeys on the Japanese
Iceland

752
00:52:03,569 --> 00:52:09,000
well she might in nineteen 52 this act
is observed that some of these monkeys

753
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,319
learnt to wash sweet potatoes before the

754
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:13,040
eat

755
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,020
in gradually this new behavior spreads
through the younger generation monkeys

756
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,180
in usual fashion

757
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:23,710
through observation and their petition
what song

758
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:27,010
damn concluded that the researchers
observed

759
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:31,000
that once a critical number of monkeys
this island was reached

760
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,230
the so-called hundredth monkey this
preview issue learning behavior is that

761
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:37,210
the spreads

762
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:41,940
across the water to mike is are in their
brains blackness lintz

763
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:46,460
there is there was no physical contact
with between another monkeys

764
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:50,630
but when you have a critical mass of in
the video of

765
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:55,420
in they have some knowledge something
this critical mass

766
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:58,970
King achieved that your knowledge

767
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:02,500
in formation or energy or something

768
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,680
emotions are going to space their
project in

769
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:11,870
in another people and see species can
take this information used

770
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:16,950
it's like radio in such a way like radio
like how or

771
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:23,160
10 this forms and so on and then we come
to intercede think

772
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,390
internet internet what's internet

773
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:34,390
Internet is a materialization of
collective act conscious

774
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:38,910
we are slowly more and more connected B
team

775
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:43,410
together like in collective unconscious

776
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:46,730
because collective unconscious and this

777
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:50,470
on matter lavoro Toeplitz

778
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:53,538
are connecting as well but we cannot see
it

779
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:56,670
it's not really in some way for us

780
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,900
update these this stinks exist

781
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:04,539
the internet this so-called
modernization of these collective

782
00:54:04,539 --> 00:54:06,630
unconscious controlling the Internet

783
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:11,180
he's not only controlling your and
collective unconscious

784
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:15,419
but also your past and your future is in
the worst

785
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,910
that these two losing the freedom
congress putrid control

786
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:23,710
and goes to complete masses on be fine
Inc

787
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:29,770
is this okay for you I think no

788
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:33,038
I think then

789
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:36,839
please commit yourself to privacy and
freedom on the internet now

790
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:40,950
from this moment because the process of
controlling internet

791
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:45,520
is a rash

792
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,160
going on rush very rush going on he
spoke about
