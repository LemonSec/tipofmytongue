1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:25,930
anyway i'm watching coaster and this is
dr. probably not sure we actually

2
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:33,129
talking together but because hard time
finding ourselves in trouble so it's

3
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:42,280
actually two persons talking about just
me I'm here actually for the i think i

4
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,870
have been to all Vulcans so far so I
really like it and overtakes here for

5
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,659
the first time so please give him a warm
welcome

6
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:59,769
yeah and because we had a hard time like
updating the frob to help him also as a

7
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:05,170
core speaker in short we will talk about
hiking hard work to talk with android

8
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:12,580
what it means is we'll talk how to
actually develop some kind of hardware

9
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,690
to topic android how we can adapt some
kind of how to talk with Android and so

10
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:25,630
on so this is something we will coloring
in this 45 minutes actually one hour if

11
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:31,179
you take questions right and if you have
any questions feel free to to ask you

12
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,580
doing presentations as well so this is
something we will which which we thought

13
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,539
we also have some kind of demonstrations
just a show of some some of the things

14
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:48,640
and yeah let's go short if you don't
know me I make sure security consultant

15
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,180
indirect are actually yet another
penetration tester right and I'm

16
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:00,610
actually hoping a lot of for my own open
source project and also i helped

17
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:05,590
contribute to LA to find the projects of
the sauce mostly security-related and

18
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,460
you can actually find me on the github

19
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,970
this is the link so you can find the
project I'm working on

20
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,970
regarding my undergrad experience

21
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:23,910
well I'm counting from my first android
market up so it's since 2010 and I'm not

22
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,710
focusing mostly on the development like
a job and stuff mostly focusing on and

23
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,490
the ka dhacay what it means that means
native development kit right and access

24
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:38,040
the development kit which is kind of
lower things so how it looks like well

25
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,230
it's usually like this one right

26
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:46,590
what wires and yeah I also done like
partying and not too different textures

27
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,820
so if you are using for example and open
android on kindle probably use my

28
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,090
pictures for the binary if you trust me
enough right

29
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:02,730
and dr. is i'm working as a system
administrator in library in faculty of

30
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:09,209
humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb
and so three softer bigger since 1995

31
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,700
also had the gift get Bob i have blogged
on which you can follow me if you like

32
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,609
hardware and to be quite honest I don't
like and raise as much as cause to do

33
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,210
but i do like hard work here

34
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:32,370
ok so the first question is actually
develop our adult why I'm not why I'm

35
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,240
asking this question because usually you
can just take something off the shelf

36
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,970
and just adapted to your needs but what
it means so for example are very nice

37
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,070
much popular nowadays and you can find
it everywhere and everybody starts

38
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,530
playing with it it's actually started to
it

39
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,680
oh I have this temperature sensor and i
will connect to the internet and i will

40
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,690
have temperature right I guess everybody
who tried Audrina probably started with

41
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,180
this way but actually with if you just
need temperature you actually don't need

42
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,730
to connect and are doing or and such
stuff you can just take some kind of

43
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:14,609
farm android phone and if its curve

44
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,048
good sensors you can actually just have
to use the hardware and just if you have

45
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:26,210
some kind of fault on the red phone you
can just take it and write adopted and

46
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,510
write something for it and then you can
have like your temperature ambient

47
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:38,210
temperature to the internet right so
usually the problem is not all Android

48
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,810
hardware is same so if you have some
kind of something phone or if you have

49
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,780
HTC or whatever it doesn't have all the
sensors so we have to be really picky

50
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,219
which one you will take

51
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,840
so for example if you can want to Swan
it doesn't have ambient temperature if

52
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,710
you have something to have and so on so
it's always kind of different right and

53
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:06,109
that that why it's actually if you want
to do it some kind of my supplication

54
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,760
maybe it's not that way but if you just
needed to quickly do it something you

55
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:20,690
just need to find some kind of old
hardware and just take the the wii the

56
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:27,889
phone which have like such kind of
sensor so we are the other fingers if

57
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:33,350
you need like to combine much more sense
like I know ambient temperature and

58
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,150
greens sensor and so on right you can
always like take something with John on

59
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,690
the right hair and just connect the
other ones which mission it's much

60
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:48,979
cheaper than hearing a the development
from from stars right if you count your

61
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:55,789
time and everything so to prove this
point I actually made some kind of first

62
00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:01,370
implant 3dep to look all the sensors you
can so it will detect all kinds of

63
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,260
environmental sensors that means
temperatures and everything into log to

64
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:12,200
whatever our URL you get it right so it
will just end like let's call it rest

65
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,969
right it will send all the census data
to some kind of location you specify

66
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:22,070
your special URL just leave it and it
will actually send all the sensor data

67
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:28,190
it was actually my birthday present from
costs and my use case was I was trying

68
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:34,010
to figure out when my washing is done
and they said okay I can make a sense or

69
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:39,920
I can make are doing i can take esp8266
or i can take all the android phone and

70
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,200
just startled the sensors up the web
server somewhere and then crunch data

71
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,729
there and from the data because usually
carry enough sensors there including

72
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:54,410
sound and everything to actually figure
out from them what is your washing

73
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:01,490
machine doing so until your phone drops
from the motion machine right which will

74
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:06,920
also detect yeah so it's really basic
application it's not so user-friendly

75
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,440
but it actually does the thing that's
the things which are supposed to done

76
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,170
right of course this is this can be a
privacy invader because the Blitz asked

77
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,410
to embed like a GPS longer so it's
better to use some kind of encryption

78
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:27,380
right so you have actually all the GPS
coordinate from the gps and all the

79
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,260
sense of theta sending someone else
right

80
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,920
yeah it can be privacy right about the
doctor doesn't care

81
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:41,390
yeah you don't get privacy anywhere on
the internet so if you really cannot

82
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:47,180
find something which we can use from
from the android and and there's not no

83
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,010
days there's a lot of force which which
have really our large number of sensors

84
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:57,620
on it so if you cannot find it right
then you have to develop your own right

85
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,150
the first thing is ok but what they do
right where to start

86
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:08,960
well just think is it your final goal to
actually develop the ready-made kit or

87
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,640
you're just wanting to to do something
so problem once and forget it right for

88
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:20,450
yourself and not what everyone else
right and interdependence about user

89
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,800
experience and speed of communication
and communication security what what you

90
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,480
will choose to actually communicate with
all these sensors

91
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:34,530
what you will need actually is some kind
of this kit if you're starting I know if

92
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,490
you're already doing some some hardware
but this is actually something you will

93
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:45,300
need yeah we actually lazy so we just
borrow it for a guy we know who actually

94
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,310
wrote it what you will need and you can
actually find it easily on the like the

95
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,930
extreme or Aliexpress and all those
chinese website where you can buy nice

96
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,489
electronic stuff and just be completely
something what you will need

97
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,300
so in there to be completely Frank we
don't agree with him with his choice of

98
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,569
soldiering iron but you know

99
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:12,090
yeah we also don't agree on what what
else do you need right beside that also

100
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,540
would recommend to help us pilot of
course for analyzing and detail stereo

101
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,439
cable but the actual don't need to tell
cable if your butt pirate because you

102
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,510
can always like health center i'm
walking inside mass pilot

103
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,030
yeah it's

104
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:36,299
this is something like you have
different kinds and it's you can find

105
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:43,470
from animal 20 box 40 bucks to 16 right
depending on diversion and everything so

106
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,809
yeah and this is of course logic
analyzer layout for you can buy for ten

107
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:52,230
bucks which can get you started
analyzing things

108
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:57,209
this is a Chinese clone of serologic oh
no is it just you completely Frank yeah

109
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,439
the best part is actually force with
sheetrock so you can actually get all

110
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:05,160
the date I and everything from the for
example it's right to apply the signal

111
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,238
in full view

112
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:13,649
so I if you look from from the other
prospective or communication perspective

113
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:19,860
your hard work and talk quite right with
different things with violence both off

114
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:27,989
NFC USB serial they were right to choose
and if you start with the while ser you

115
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:29,459
know everything right

116
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:33,540
we are here i would call technical
conference so i will not explain all

117
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:41,279
this stuff and yeah these are some of
these options and what I find useful for

118
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,540
reversing once i find some kind of water
which I want to adapt is actually this

119
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,309
is kind of talking to EJ prefer to have
of course you if i'm just getting the

120
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:51,868
data to actually analyze it

121
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:56,910
of course he's mad and eric and this be
down helps a lot but for actually

122
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,499
analyzing it

123
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:03,419
of course why shark and the shark but if
I have a lot of traffic i prefer to have

124
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:08,669
it inside mala it indexes up a lot and
reduces like elasticsearch so can

125
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:15,959
actually go through it very easily and
find the buttons yourself you have it on

126
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:22,138
the doctor as well dr. eyes so you can
just actually docker build it then hear

127
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,529
it directly from there

128
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:29,060
and also sometimes if the protocol is
much more complex is speaker bindings

129
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,998
for of course one of your favorite
languages right and yeah except it

130
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:36,319
always helps

131
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:43,219
so let's go for some quick example so
this was one example where my daughter

132
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,980
was i know crazy about that sick RC cars
remote control cars let's hear it one

133
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:56,600
here it's actually being good a day as I
am I have worked for one right so I like

134
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:04,129
to play it right and everywhere every
girl needs is the RC car right yeah so

135
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:05,959
yeah after sometime

136
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:11,748
yeah that means today's she was interest
right so they go to interest

137
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:18,589
ok so you play it you don't want to i
outplayed right and ok it's now the

138
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:20,779
Detroit first finger which will do

139
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:30,439
of course they will take it apart so how
it works actually that that car is

140
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:35,660
actually wireless access point and it's
open wireless network with certificates

141
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,800
IDU just connected then it's typical
tcp/ip which different ports and you can

142
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:46,910
connect it and just use right and if you
don't basic information there's like

143
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:52,790
four parts for different communication
and if you see there is like HTTP server

144
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:58,639
and you have also like some kind of
strange part 1 2001 right and yeah if

145
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,339
you just connect to this port like 280
you can't like open wireless camera

146
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:13,160
well that means that means that if
somebody connects right . to destroy its

147
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,179
actually there's no protection network
or application viral and there's no

148
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:19,170
possible encryption

149
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,699
educational and levels that means you
everybody can connect it and of course

150
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:31,290
look at the stream of the camera or like
take advantage of the god itself

151
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,899
yeah if you are sitting on your ears
like for a few years now we are now but

152
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:47,279
I an era where boys can spy on us and
get into business but the problem is if

153
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,720
you're pessimistic you'll say all this
is privacy invading and security arrived

154
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,740
we are together on and so on but if your
mystic you can always have a new

155
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,089
business opportunity right so this one
is getting into business with camera

156
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:07,110
color price right so it depends how you
look at things so if you look at the

157
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:12,329
basic protocol analysis you are using
wireshark you just look at the data

158
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:18,449
trying to find the patterns but i
actually like is I like to use graphical

159
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:22,889
interface to actually do it likes kind
of quick analysis structural analysis

160
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:28,019
and then if I find some kind of bottom
tonight use like text for finding the

161
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:33,000
buttons and why should help me to
actually dumped it completely in for

162
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,060
example in C so i can actually just
taste it and send it so how it looks

163
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:44,670
like actually this is kind of you just
used a little shell scripting and so on

164
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,589
and then you can actually find easily
buttons so here is an example of

165
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:56,550
extracting department itself if you look
for some time and try like different

166
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,079
buttons that means for example go
forward you will see if it what what

167
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,709
beats are changing and then you try to
go down and left and right and now you

168
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:09,449
know which be changing and then you try
to experiment sent to the device and

169
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:13,959
then of course you know they're called
the particle looks like right

170
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:29,650
so okay i'll try to be on the microphone
so i'll just use mouse so here you can

171
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,480
actually see they have some kind of
starting like I'm starting of command

172
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:41,290
and here they have some kind of end of
command like FF and here is for example

173
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:52,240
usage of ford motor or backwards or left
to right and so on and here is little

174
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,810
checksum which is standard basic checks
which is easily you can identify right

175
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:07,420
so let's let me show you how it works
and how you can actually connect it here

176
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,349
it makes it so its bigger car

177
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:32,070
oh thanks so what so it is basically i
found out the protocol and i just sent

178
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:37,050
to everything like okay go left right
and now you know everything and then go

179
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:42,479
backwards but this is not actually the
the . . is actually combining the

180
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:50,940
Android itself with the with his sin
source and with which is a protocol and

181
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,780
everything so for example I would just
show you one of the things you can do

182
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:59,459
you can actually just gripped it right
and the other thing is you can actually

183
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,420
let's say let me

184
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,399
it's turned off in the meantime yeah it
always works when you start right

185
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,099
and actually the good thing is you can
actually strip then

186
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:28,359
oh say okay i'll just go this way this
way and so one but actually combining

187
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,770
this and and the phone you can actually
have like kind of for design you can

188
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:38,200
actually help button recognition with
the phone he's good enough and you can

189
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,090
also the camera and I i've a undertaking
camera so you can actually like a

190
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,620
binding and see like a obstacle
detection and so on using bait is all

191
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,610
things and he can also gps so you can
actually combine every thing and here

192
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,740
are some kind of cell phone numbers that
I've combining these two right well you

193
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,630
can also do other things one of the
examples is for example

194
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,470
hi can I lon

195
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,220
let's try to force it to hell up

196
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:16,928
so it's going like the last 5 and so on

197
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,600
yeah

198
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,570
yeah

199
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,320
yeah

200
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:45,090
the other part is not work so the other
part is actually having something like

201
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:57,478
how let me try this one so if it phone
rings so for example we consented to

202
00:18:57,479 --> 00:19:03,809
actually go around the circle if
somebody is calling

203
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:11,849
we like and if somebody is not going to
like right then it can i no go over and

204
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:19,529
over again are hiding in the corner or
something something like this right so

205
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:20,820
let's try this one

206
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,820
let me just set it up

207
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,690
ok

208
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,889
so i will connect to the phone

209
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,230
and now we'll divide the vault

210
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,660
yeah

211
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,990
display

212
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,990
take some time to actually connect so

213
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:10,560
I ok i actually let me help you

214
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,429
so

215
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:24,990
you can actually see on the phone and it
looks like right i can so the camera

216
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:36,780
you'll split so if i call it right you
probably don't see anything right

217
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,880
Oh

218
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:50,070
the stream ok so now two and now it's
like a same command to actually go

219
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,600
around or something right

220
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,199
Oh

221
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,370
yeah

222
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:05,379
I guess connect the wireless right
sometimes it's very shaky because if if

223
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,920
there's some kind of connection like two
or three people connecting to the same

224
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:18,580
garden and they have problems so yeah we
start always helps right okay okay

225
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,240
come to pray to blame God something just
doesn't work right

226
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,540
we are now waiting for the violence
network of the car to appear

227
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,260
and it is the first one in the top

228
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:53,370
yeah actually have the HTTP server on
inside and everything right so please if

229
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:59,459
you are connecting right now please done
because to them or probably will not

230
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:07,680
work if there's so much people
connecting to the same SSID so maybe you

231
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,540
want to censor it until you're dancing
they can like to play with it right you

232
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:22,770
can play with it we trust you all for
all our friends and our system

233
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,520
this

234
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
remember seat

235
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,800
so what we're doing is like waiting on
intent of actually broadcast receiver

236
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:43,040
for phone and then if it rains then it
should connect and go around but now

237
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:57,409
yeah we'll try later why don't you try
it on the inside but will continue and

238
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,610
you saw the call for part of it but over
to work on it so you will see it on the

239
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,610
am sorry for

240
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:16,560
yeah so yeah as you can see our prayers
were when so good so yeah we only just

241
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:22,379
got off of it so but you know what's the
most interesting part now when i started

242
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:32,340
playing now she wants to pick right and
the other things we which actually is

243
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:36,360
good for communication if you can kind
of power is of course but off which of

244
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:43,919
course like ET le and so on and I mean
its standard finger and you can actually

245
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,030
find it on the reference on there were
400 comments so on so i will not cover

246
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:53,910
it too much the only thing which kind of
it's not documented there is like boof

247
00:23:53,910 --> 00:24:04,830
analysis right but what is most
interesting is that the toes i guess you

248
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:10,409
know already like even 21 spectrum
analyzer more radiant as the I right can

249
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:17,910
help while spectrum analyzer and like
not agency is very low level but with

250
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:25,560
other tools you can actually get it much
more method like this so it works here

251
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:31,979
yeah you can actually do it and so on

252
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,700
there is also like possibility to
actually implement such communication

253
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,590
also with the from from the phone game
applications and from the Colorado

254
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:48,300
applications and so on so he is it works
also without any problems but this is

255
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:53,399
everything standard and documented so i
will not go into too much details

256
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,770
everything is there

257
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:00,660
there is also like NFC communication I I
can't see too much but it's actually

258
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:10,250
from the other side can be secure and
not so yeah i w-want want to tell you

259
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,110
something about the NFC right if you
feel something like it's yeah you're

260
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:21,290
being very used to the NFC but basically
to two different frequencies and few

261
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:26,210
different protocols on the high
frequency which weekend on the previous

262
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:31,790
slide pink and the thing I have to warn
you it is that if you have the older

263
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:36,290
Android phone with the NFC you actually
have the better device because in the

264
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:42,379
newer devices they actually disabled the
Mifare classic cards which is quite good

265
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:47,120
because we should face them out and they
are known security attacks against them

266
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,610
for the last five years or so but in a
sense the newer phones can read less

267
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:57,469
cards and all the ones and then if your
phone does not ring

268
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,790
read the card or if you have some kind
of access token for the doors

269
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,550
it's probably the other frequency which
android which is not in NFC but it's

270
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:14,510
also virus which is not supported on the
android so not all rfid cards are

271
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,540
created equal

272
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:26,990
okay yeah and the other way well how you
can actually communicate with some kind

273
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,970
of harder if you have a like a android
phone is actually with USB right you

274
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,380
will usually port for charging and you
actually can use it for communication

275
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:44,450
options which you can actually there's a
lot of different options but most usual

276
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:52,010
ones actually with cereal as a serial
device and as a device which is actually

277
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:56,720
like your keyboard input and so on so
that means you can actually make it very

278
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,260
easy to work with for example with this
page

279
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,770
welcome page we can actually make

280
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:06,960
walking down the road as well as any
other right if you had any experience

281
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,990
with rubber ducky screams or I know
incey do you know and such things that

282
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,550
actually yeah it is the same thing and
what the most interesting part you can

283
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,060
actually just use it if you're an
offensive side you can actually use it

284
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:27,179
to to have some kind of I know enable
debugging and so on so some such kind of

285
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,380
attacks but also if you're working on
something to work with android it's

286
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,600
actually good to have some kind of
communication with keyboard and mouse

287
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:42,959
right the other standard fingers like
storage device but there's not so much

288
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,640
options if you some kind of sensors to
to have something like this right and

289
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:55,200
it's a device to actually like I don't
walk over to reach right maybe the month

290
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:05,160
that the only problem is once you start
developing with with USB right you are

291
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:11,430
using you're actually losing the way how
to debug because you can't help this

292
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:18,450
same connection right for your computer
into the device that's why a TB or TCP

293
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:23,340
IP or ATM network is kind of cool so you
can actually hear it over the network

294
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,000
and then you can actually work with the
device itself once your programming

295
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,100
right of course there are models where
you have multiple USB port so yeah then

296
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,689
you can do it right but usually if you
have phone then or tablet usually it's

297
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:41,640
only one part and then you have to
enable 280 be right or what this VIP

298
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,760
area

299
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,120
let's use well-liked print case or text
messages

300
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,760
usually we go to the bottom such
problems how you enable it there is like

301
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:01,680
a lot of ways it's actually what you do
is you have board and you'd just

302
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:07,770
communicate with these people and there
are also like security implications in

303
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,269
short

304
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:13,099
that means usually if you open up baby
port on the network that means everybody

305
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:18,950
can actually the bug and on your android
device so you don't want to enable it in

306
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:24,889
and secure environment right and how you
can actually set it there is like a lot

307
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:32,478
of hundred ops actually helps you to
enable like while satb and usually doesn

308
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,989
t the road for any other device you
don't need to be able to actually enable

309
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:41,570
ATM network so this is usually commands
which you can actually do it in

310
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:46,369
terminology if you don't want to install
anything more just use adb shell of

311
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:52,189
terminal from down to it and actually
really helps in debugging other problems

312
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:58,429
of course there is also options to
actually write your own device that I

313
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:05,119
this is the problematic on Android
because if it is called the pendant what

314
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,349
I mean like your own device driver is
that you write your own condom on that

315
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:13,458
will not work for people who don't the
audacity of hope so you don't want to go

316
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:18,859
that way if you want to have a lot of
users for the who doesn't want to have

317
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:24,079
heard and so on and so on and you also
have like no compatibility there is like

318
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:27,320
a lot of different kernels and if you
had how we're going to distribute it

319
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,539
should everyone compile it and so on

320
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:36,019
there's a lot of cases where it's really
the only way to do it but if you're

321
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:42,440
doing anything like user-friendly then
probably this is not the way to go

322
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:50,230
but there is also a specification units
be there if you need some kind of

323
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:55,510
specific drivers right then the only way
for you care of some kind of particular

324
00:30:55,510 --> 00:31:00,370
android harder which you are writing
custom application for it's a valid

325
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:06,129
option we are different and also there
is like the other way is actually fall

326
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,190
of the excessive development kit from
the google beyond that's the safeway

327
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:14,769
right it's officially supported you have
support for both of us be and so on and

328
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:18,460
it all works over a hundred of an
accessory protocol they don't have to

329
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:25,870
have it and so on and Google is actually
distributing such boats like to test

330
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:31,029
this is actually are doing interfacing
android and you can actually taste there

331
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:37,450
is like a few versions of of this ATM
aboard which we'll distributed few years

332
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:45,429
ago on ioe confidences right but it is
but in a sense it seems to us that

333
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:49,389
google actually abandoned at a year
because they didn't mention it in the

334
00:31:49,389 --> 00:31:55,059
last few google i/o and all the code
which you will actually find right now

335
00:31:55,059 --> 00:32:00,940
want to work without modifications if
you could write on the older harder the

336
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:08,049
the good side is that this is to
automate 256 the big arduino in a sense

337
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:12,820
with the with the additional shield so
everything you can do on a DK you can do

338
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:20,500
on arduino mega so it might be viable
option but then again out-of-the-box

339
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,750
it's not as well supported as the next
possibility which costs will tell us

340
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:31,330
yeah this one is actually a very well
documented on their website so we don't

341
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:37,299
have too much body right and here is the
other thing is actually cell

342
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:38,649
communication right

343
00:32:38,649 --> 00:32:43,899
the good part is the truth is not needed
in your versions of colonel and you can

344
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:51,010
actually communicate with our serial
cable actual serial communication and

345
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:55,200
there is like support from android free
so that means a lot of phones

346
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:02,220
would support it and there is really
good families on top of API so you can

347
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,600
actually talk directly with it harder
and you don't need actually wrote right

348
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:15,418
so this is something which is good and
well what key it's using its actually

349
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:21,419
using like a horse API from Android then
there is like a serial driver library so

350
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:26,639
you connect your doctor tcf to the eye
and so on and of course we have to be no

351
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:32,668
its own the good part about this one is
you you can like really good libraries

352
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:36,600
and you can actually talk directly with
of course with API but also there is

353
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:42,330
little bit obstructing libraries to talk
about it so it really looks like this

354
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:48,570
one you don't need too much like cold
and it's quite easy and it's also you

355
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:53,158
can do it in JavaScript like fun gift
for the line such things right you just

356
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:57,840
install the platform plugin is that
going to get the serial port and it

357
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:05,100
works out of the box right how it should
be the good part is actually i'm using

358
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,940
it for example if I need to quickly see
something with by that you can actually

359
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:16,200
just have this kind of microalgae cable
right and you just connect the two the

360
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:22,049
for example to the bus pirate and you
can actually hit on the on the tablet

361
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,790
pacifier on 41 or whatever and connect
with something to look up then you can

362
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:32,879
really just connected directly write you
need to connect phone or connect

363
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:40,828
computer and so on so it's kind of
really good library so the other example

364
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:45,329
for example using like a serial
communication is this multimeter you can

365
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:50,849
actually find it on dealextreme it's
really UD 61 and

366
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:57,400
what what's good about this multimeter
is here actually kind of interface very

367
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:04,630
you can get a date out which is
displayed and the part which is good is

368
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:09,550
that actually you can really buy really
cheap it for example of your creation

369
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:13,720
creation you can find local electronics
store go to put their kind you can also

370
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:22,569
find xtreme and so on and it have like
communication material right so if you

371
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:28,360
look at it it's really care like basic
cell communication and how you actually

372
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:34,390
get it actually see how it works for the
protocol itself right looking at the

373
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:39,850
product specification see my product
specification yeah there is also like

374
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:45,279
ways to actually take the baseball rate
so that means that the best thing for us

375
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,170
guessing i try with every speed and get
the parameters right then the other

376
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:58,210
parameters like stop bead parity and so
on and its basic analysis of what we

377
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:02,470
same done on the wireless its aim on the
serial port right getting as much

378
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,720
communication as possible

379
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,529
changing flipping beats and getting the
health practical looks like the right

380
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:14,350
and find the bottoms and differences
right if you look from the security

381
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,830
considerations tis cool it's quite open
a possible encryption and authentication

382
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:24,730
but this time it's not wireless right so
it's only white tail and by looking at

383
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:29,230
the cell communication this one for
example have this kind of communication

384
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:37,450
what what we found out its standard 204
plentiful 400

385
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:45,010
bits per second it beats and so on and
its really like easy you just helped 14

386
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:51,490
byte packets and there is like a first
few bites are merely oh and the other

387
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,529
bits legs

388
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:57,280
well it's not so interesting from a
security perspective but it's actually

389
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,520
can help you analysis what why have we
think about this one is because what if

390
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,759
i can get the readings from the android
phone so i don't have to protect the

391
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:12,850
like personal computer and for example i
can get a nice graph from the multimeter

392
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:18,549
so that means i have some kind of one
general logic analyzer right and i can

393
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:22,900
actually export well as to see it
c-suite on the SD card and take pictures

394
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:29,020
with coming on spike with OSD and why
this i think the little better explain

395
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,730
right there

396
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:35,620
the ideas that you have some kind of
motherboard in front of you you find the

397
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:41,350
ground and you want to mark some other
headers on it and so the idea is to

398
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:46,450
actually attach your ground from the
movie meter to the to the board and then

399
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:52,660
just probe around the board and every
time the video or the reading changes it

400
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:57,460
will actually take the picture which
will include the point of your probe if

401
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,960
you position your android phone correct
and the value you found on it whether

402
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,970
that pin was free . free walls whether
it was Caillou or low so you don't

403
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,080
actually have to take notes while you
are debugging something you just grows

404
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:17,799
through pictures and then if you want to
make some kind of notes and we think it

405
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:24,010
might be really helpful so of so imagine
you're doing analysis and you just put

406
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:31,240
with those holders right your phone or a
tablet and connect your multimeter and

407
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,560
you just press the pins and when it
takes the spike it will automatically

408
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,730
take the picture and write the ride the
rails to the exhibit and picture itself

409
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:45,490
and then you just go for the pictures
and now which means you touch then what

410
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,490
what the value

411
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:55,279
right so it can kind of help you with
the bugging however and we actually

412
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,450
wrote the proof of concept of this it's
under the application like using city

413
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:04,790
library and its driving the german grafs
was using on the plot so let's see the

414
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:11,480
demo you know if we have some kind of
far and on android tablets and we're all

415
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:18,770
connected using usb OTG cable right
fingers crossed this is this doesn't

416
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,119
involve I fight

417
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:24,650
yeah its serial communication right so
all the wires

418
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:32,900
yep know this

419
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:38,720
ok let me try now to show with cheese

420
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:46,459
well cost is preparing that not all
unity 61 multimeters are created equal

421
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:53,180
if you have choice at all take unity 61
e and not some other model this is some

422
00:39:53,180 --> 00:40:00,080
other models but the model is much more
precise is to 22,000 counts multimeter

423
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:08,960
which is quite amazing 450 bucks so as
you can see here it's actually first is

424
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,330
gives a list of devices which are
connected

425
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:16,100
that means that you can actually have
much more like serial devices right and

426
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:21,980
much more multimeters this casey aight
ask for permission see ya

427
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:29,780
we can talk to the device and now you
have like a really nice graph of of the

428
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,400
values here right

429
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,700
no but it's ariel try to change values
so you can actually see the graph the

430
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:43,069
other part is what we talked is that it
will try to do change detection right so

431
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:51,020
it will be if it's change detection if
it detects sudden drop or a spike and it

432
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,819
will automatically take picture and
actually offensive on

433
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:57,930
and so you can actually have it like
here taking pictures and you can

434
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:02,848
actually look at the value right defense
which camera will use and so on right

435
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:09,839
and also there is option like to take a
bit every time it detects spike so you

436
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:16,049
can go further to do analysis right
anybody finds it useful

437
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,960
ok

438
00:41:26,299 --> 00:41:40,699
so yeah it helps actually in in analysis
let me turn this off we can actually so

439
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:46,849
it won't have time to close and later so
you can actually see the values and how

440
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:54,109
it takes the spikes and yeah this is the
application itself we will upload it to

441
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:57,920
the github and placed are so you can
actually have played with it you just

442
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:05,179
need to buy such monumental right but
are extremely multimeter with the serial

443
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:10,549
port support and tell me to patch right
yeah but then you'll need to parse and

444
00:42:10,549 --> 00:42:14,959
do the bottom lashes for your own
multimeter and at to the but i will

445
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:17,959
accept the request of course and you can
forget or whatever right

446
00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:23,718
look the good hint is to take a look at
secret because it supports a huge range

447
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:28,699
of of multimeters so you probably don't
have to reverse engineer the protocol

448
00:42:28,699 --> 00:42:33,319
yourself devices already supported in
seagrove just read the source code and

449
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:43,429
three implement that yeah so there is
just one example which is kind of a

450
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:47,449
brawling Adam me I don't know if you
have for this device but it's very cheap

451
00:42:47,449 --> 00:42:56,869
device like 20 bucks and it's some kind
of let's call it like why do is to

452
00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:03,289
infrared bridge because you can connect
with wireless and then an ottoman three

453
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:08,420
enough the air conditioner and you can
do it or internet right standard like

454
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:16,279
IOT things and yeah i got it from Tony
made by the way we stock his last talked

455
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:17,390
before the

456
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:24,200
the workshop and yeah we started looking
at it as you can see right and it's

457
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:30,710
actually a standard model controller and
so on and looking at the communication

458
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:39,319
actually yeah we talked to cloud and it
but it actually if you disable by your

459
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,130
own firewall to not talk with internet
you can actually have local

460
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,260
communication as well right

461
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:51,020
what of course you can secure and and so
on but actually just communication port

462
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,610
80 you'd be so if you see if that
communication and you turn on something

463
00:43:55,610 --> 00:44:00,320
you can actually just do the replay
attack and just repeat the same one and

464
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:08,780
the to walk right so it's same with any
device which you just take the payload

465
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,800
how you actually turn it on and you can
do the replay

466
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,630
oh no not again right we don't have time
to externalize that allowed one

467
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:22,250
communication so yeah it's probably it
will be fun right

468
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,240
so definitely worth looking if you want
to join

469
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,700
we have some kind of pic of dumps of
communications for for example two weeks

470
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,700
so you don't have to do it yourself

471
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:45,040
and yeah so he could be short and how to
actually our partner for Android as you

472
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,540
can see we actually just try to take
some kind of similar device which have

473
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:56,170
similar like functionality but you just
add missing functionality that means if

474
00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:00,339
this is not for the masses it's it
really helps and even really easily do

475
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:06,190
something adopted right if you just need
some specific sensors you really maybe

476
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:10,930
you don't need that all right maybe
region you can just use the standard

477
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:18,609
sensors and yeah regarding all those
custom hardware and so on

478
00:45:18,609 --> 00:45:22,509
I really found out that serial
communication is working pretty well in

479
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:28,030
route and i would say its way to go in
in Android world with this one of course

480
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:31,720
if you need like wired communication if
you need while seiu have a lot of

481
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,459
options which we mentioned right and we
had really what I'm doing all these

482
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:43,990
things if you have any questions we are
here organised asked us to actually if

483
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:49,569
you have some questions you have to come
here to the microphone and we are

484
00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:56,740
looking forward expressions if you had
something for the questions so it will

485
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,270
be well worth it

486
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:01,660
yeah if you already have something right
yeah if you are over 18

487
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,890
can you can you come to the mic

488
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,300
anymore any questions

489
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:19,400
come on gifts are small but they're here
yeah it's for preparation for our sake

490
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,340
workshop

491
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:29,600
come on come on we have one question
here are you have to come up here and

492
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:34,250
all your question okay okay yeah i I'm
sorry to ask something that's like such

493
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:40,190
a tangent but i I've been not wondering
if i want to buy a nice oscilloscope how

494
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:48,800
I should go about it like over where can
I find out like a what you have to speak

495
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,120
on microphone the story

496
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:55,759
yeah i remember i needed for my
application I need a like the cheap ones

497
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,630
that don't have the cheap ones that
don't work with them they need a high

498
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:02,720
frame rate or something like that so it
needs to be a good one

499
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,419
how much money do need to have to have
great i have noted to get the good one

500
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,590
but i wanted to be a good one

501
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:12,710
do actually good not just you have 400
bucks yeah

502
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:20,149
regal 1054 said great and you can take
it to get double bandwidth because there

503
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:24,920
is a key generator on the web for it so
you know your turn

504
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,720
$400 or still scope into seven hundred
dollar with seals go by just typing a

505
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,529
few numbers

506
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:33,530
oh cool thank you it is your gift

507
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:40,280
you're welcome oh yeah and you get to
give I think we don't ask one more

508
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,720
question I have a question about

509
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,310
you said you can connect the interface
device and some sort of interface

510
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:54,700
thank you i did I wonder if you said we
don't need rude but I i tried to use the

511
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,839
abilities it's actually requiring grew
to be acting like a mouse on keyboard

512
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:04,810
and some sort of like that in many
cities it's only supporting because I

513
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:11,500
check my Colonel I'm using 3.0 2.4 is
better than anything I know about it

514
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,869
because it's just has a lot of support
on the default so but it still does

515
00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:21,369
require root are you sure it's only
supporting some specific device has it

516
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:25,450
so it's kind of like a can depend on
port for cereal i'm pretty sure it works

517
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:33,160
on free . or iron right but for hit
devices to cost you to customize the

518
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,410
channel because i am I hated myself

519
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:40,390
yeah yeah but the problem is if you want
android to be here device but if you if

520
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:41,170
you want

521
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:46,930
he devised to talk to be like you if you
want to connect mouse or even worth or

522
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:47,859
this page

523
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:52,420
welcome page then you don't need all
that means yeah I never found has into

524
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,839
other ways my android gonna be a
keyboard and mouse acting like that then

525
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:02,140
you need wrote okay yeah I even on no no
devices as hard as I know so yeah okay I

526
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,319
have another question when you try to
connect to

527
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:12,430
the card you use a virus communication
with the between to them but my question

528
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:17,140
is why didn't you encrypted using
encryption of security about the things

529
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:22,150
you put in there is custom right i mean
is it just a hardware limitation or with

530
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:29,830
the program limitation the the idea
behind car the car is actually within

531
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:34,000
customize it it's really like
off-the-shelf car it's a more exciting

532
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,040
you're not running while custom code on
it so that means its customer is not

533
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,210
customized i'm just about the protocol
and then used that protocol direction

534
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:48,130
without him so I didn't customize the
former itself i only just wrote the

535
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:53,050
protocol which he already have in the
former so I didn't touch the the

536
00:49:53,050 --> 00:50:00,790
clientele so yeah that's why I'm talking
about the the car because it's GI it

537
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:04,480
doesn't have anything like my encryption
and authentication nothing because if

538
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,850
you might of the Shelf somebody connects
yeah you can you can watch it you had

539
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,110
this coming out right

540
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:18,400
ok last question is when you try to do
it

541
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:29,760
you use it a I'm sorry try to not sure
take your time take a sip ya or take the

542
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,760
rakia or take an idea and it will be
easier

543
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:50,310
we are definitely a sure I agree about
the up about the adb connection you said

544
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:55,740
we can use a tcp/ip connection over to
locate the serial connection yes are so

545
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:59,549
you said it doesn't working when you
plug the cable and we can do some sort

546
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:05,100
of other communications to about on my
device i tested myself but I don't have

547
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:10,200
all the phones but just as I know my
phone is galaxy note 2 just all but I

548
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:15,870
can when I connect with the cable i can
still do the other stuff too so maybe

549
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:22,230
you said is some sort of a device
differences between is a DB cableway

550
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:27,900
limitations but if you use the wireless
Vegas we're gonna be just you know free

551
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:32,430
ourselves from the cable but we can
still do multiple stuff in the cable to

552
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:37,770
yes or it's just intimidation or
something like that

553
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:44,009
there that actually device-specific if
you ever had a Galaxy Nexus the the

554
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:49,410
original Nexus yes which is similar to
your phone if you have all older Colonel

555
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:54,060
you would get of shit load of USB
devices when you when you connected to

556
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:58,200
computer would get a separate serial
device for the modem you would get a

557
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:04,830
separate storage device for they for the
internal flesh and then when when they

558
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:09,450
started updating Colonel you get you
started losing those abilities so if

559
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:14,279
this this is fairly specific to your
particularly wise so in a sense you are

560
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,390
happy

561
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:16,490
yeah but this

562
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:22,250
in my safe I just customize my kernel
and lot so I have all of it in once I

563
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:26,030
can see it I can trust that I don't live
in Los so that's why I wonder is this

564
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:29,060
device specific or not so I'm not and
I'm sure thank you so much

565
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:34,640
yep ok we have for example here is only
have one part right tablet but if you

566
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,170
have some kind of like s2b android
device they can usually much more port

567
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:44,630
so you can actually just use all of them
or USB yeah yeah yeah

568
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:48,470
then that's really depends

569
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:57,759
they're in the trunk

570
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:01,070
yes

571
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:04,070
design

572
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:13,500
yeah and the other the other ways
actually because it's divisive .

573
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:19,020
dependent and sometimes it's just easier
it is just a video network is kind of

574
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:26,130
much easier right then

575
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,930
manufacturer doesn't

576
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:38,930
so it will just repeat for the camera
because i don't think that people who

577
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:43,308
are watching the screen book here the
the only really important thing is that

578
00:53:43,309 --> 00:53:50,540
you're currently 3.4 yeah and client
right our pyria yeah so your friends

579
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:55,520
implements on the on the other hand if
you have android device and you don't

580
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,869
care about android please try putting
your Colonel to it it's not that hard if

581
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,490
you want to talk about it

582
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:13,759
we are here any other question are we
have one more question are you

583
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:20,000
overrating bc the identification cards
are you already have

584
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,510
I was getting it didn't matter skin on
the car and I saw it had a telnet port

585
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:27,200
open

586
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:32,480
yeah have you tried playing with that
yeah but the problem is it's embedded

587
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:38,359
and if you just like you have to really
be nice because it is restarted itself

588
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:43,640
after some time and then if you try to
be as the password for our it it takes a

589
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,980
lot of times you don't know the password
