1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:25,410
welcome to the third day or welcome to
k-16 the next lesson will be about las

2
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,340
veo founding the hackerspace presented
by Gordon message

3
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:44,260
huh well what the crowd first talk after
a rocky workshop and there's this

4
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,500
fanbase thank you all for coming

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:58,000
so my name is maker and I am co-founder
of headspace analysis side it's a

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,880
one-and-a-half-year-old baby and we had
our share of problems and some of them

7
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:15,850
were solved attacked by free software we
wrote so i'm going to talk about our

8
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:25,750
experience in huh well how it all went
and so for start way we had a

9
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:32,110
hackerspace we have a hackerspace and
it's a nearby i'm going to talk about it

10
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:43,180
a bit more later but for now it's it's
growing and it's it's doing nice it can

11
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,259
always do better

12
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:55,570
of course and but if you want to find
something with which open-source you

13
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:04,479
need a project definitely you need a
project in a in a unpleasant way of

14
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:12,280
thinking of your new idea that is
developing as a project and

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:24,280
we try to avoid really boring stuff and
that that aspect of funding is not not

16
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,390
fun at all

17
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:31,779
so we try to automate it because mostly
were systems and we're lazy and we

18
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:50,290
automate stuff and when i get on a call
for papers we had funding and I was all

19
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:58,000
happy to announce that we have funding
as open source project but we had it for

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,150
two months and over two months we don't

21
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:08,530
so the question mark is what do you do
when you don't have funding and there is

22
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:16,000
some experience from the from the
project that you can use to while keep

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,870
on going and as I said we are we're
young we were babies and I invited to

24
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,000
stay on an axe talk which is about a bit
more mature hackerspace and their

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,769
problems and so i'm going to talk about
problems a lot but that's because i want

26
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,770
you to be aware of them and

27
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:48,540
the moral of the talk is a fun one
creating your own town one and this is

28
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,900
one of the examples that can give you
funding which is mostly the problem and

29
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:03,090
we realize that were young but mostly
web developers and systems so if we want

30
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:10,230
some funding we better do something with
it because that's this what we can do

31
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:20,190
that's what we know and we realize that
the one hackerspace actually is a bunch

32
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,079
of crazy ideas

33
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,830
well that's a crazy and of in a
hackerspace environment but to the

34
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:35,640
outside world it's just craziness and
some formulas or code or whatever but

35
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:42,960
your understood in that environment so
you can expose your ideas to really

36
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:53,940
crazy people with a lot of smart ideas
and experience how how they did it in

37
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:06,180
their own projects and one aspect that I
like to emphasize is a will to do

38
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:15,630
anything so Justin a as an example
there's a not our initiative about the

39
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:24,120
hackerspace and the moon by 2027 I think
so that that's a really strong will to

40
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:33,510
do anything and now we created a project
which is actually his fault

41
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,280
this little guy and

42
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:44,109
we're citizens and what we do is
administrating wordpress and more

43
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:51,100
wordpress and we're up to here with
wordpress and the initial idea was ok

44
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:57,070
can we create a button so that our
client can click on a button and poop

45
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:05,770
person wordpress but since then the the
idea evolved and ok so we are using

46
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:14,349
danceable right now does anyone here
know what a school is well quite a few

47
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:24,940
so Ansel is a fancy script you apply to
your server and it creates whatever the

48
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:32,560
script is meant to create so you have
this among others wordpress and whatever

49
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,940
you put in a script it's there so
ansible galaxy is way is a market in a

50
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:46,960
in a way where people exchange their
their scripts and answer all calls them

51
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:54,969
rolls so on the other hand if you want
to create a some server doing something

52
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,610
you probably do something with the
provider and we realized well yeah we

53
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,340
could use API its modern why not

54
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:12,940
and what we didn't know what the pain
was 24 bunch of system ins is to learn

55
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:20,500
front end and it was really painful
experience I think it's worthwhile but

56
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,000
while I don't wish to go through that
again

57
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:38,860
so front-end we're kind of stuck with
modern stack with the redox material you

58
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:46,360
i read and react and socket i/o which is
just a bunch of list of

59
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:54,400
frameworks we use but i think it's
combined in a system anyway so let's not

60
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:03,219
touch the code at all let's make it do
its own job kind of thing and once there

61
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:10,479
was front and we needed design and we
really suck at design so material you I

62
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:20,110
helped moral of this story is you have
to realize what you're strong at and

63
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,289
what were your weak points and deal with
it

64
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:28,810
I mean that it's there so you better
deal with it so we know we don't know

65
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:37,120
design and thank you material you I but
worse

66
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,429
this is our strong point so it's
basically we we've done everything in

67
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:52,149
backend of course and the idea was that
has this advanced we are using Python

68
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:57,760
all the time so how about we learn to
program a bit so we create something

69
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:06,100
useful and we are obviously scratching
our back with whatever we have and it's

70
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:14,050
convenient and so it's a by the way if
if you're seeing double that's not

71
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:28,750
because of rocket you find so back to
topic we try to use as a small stack as

72
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:38,860
possible as minimal frameworks as
possible and i think at the end because

73
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:47,110
of the develops I'd actually I think we
did in some aspects better job than

74
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,760
ansible tower which is official
application which is not open source

75
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,910
that does the same job and we'll GPL
three

76
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:03,820
even if we wanted it any other way we
couldn't because the code and a license

77
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:13,030
offensive rebound us to use GPL three
and i think it that that was a lucky

78
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:25,360
coincidence so we enjoyed so on the on
the develop side here you have to

79
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,500
publish something an ansible galaxy in
order to have something in market and

80
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:41,440
likely other people did and it's a huge
market and you you kinda have to know

81
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:50,170
right now how to use it as we're
officially last version was 001 and

82
00:10:50,170 --> 00:11:03,610
using dr. compose gave us ability to not
bound ourself to any provider or any VN

83
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:12,370
implementation so you can write on your
laptop as a on one command or in a cloud

84
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:19,570
or wherever you wish and please do and
let us know they're bugs of course their

85
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:27,910
box itself version so please report them
but now once we had a project and a

86
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:37,660
hackerspace of course we are we're back
to funding and to me that the most

87
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:46,360
important thing I ever heard as an
advice was this Congress three years ago

88
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:56,260
I heard a talk by ego who said you need
a local context you need to know local

89
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,430
context to make something with local
people and

90
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:08,819
that's that's basically what we did ok
we have a hackerspace way to need and we

91
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:15,149
have a project with which provides
something and how about we do something

92
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:24,300
windows too and our local context said
well people are not so much able to give

93
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,910
him money as a donation but they're
really willing to put an effort and

94
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:37,769
their will and their brain power into
creating something that's wonderful

95
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:38,699
actually

96
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:48,300
and here we are with one of the greatest
places like a class of places called

97
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:55,380
hackerspace which collect people with
high IQ and we need to find a way to

98
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:01,170
figure out a way to raise some money
from my help

99
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:06,870
how hard can it be right i mean we
should be smart

100
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:16,079
let's do it and we did by being really
loud or at least trying to be really

101
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:27,239
loud and being really loud in in digital
age probably means facebook twitter

102
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:41,250
youtube whatever you come by as a free
way of saying hey I exist and we do this

103
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,880
and we want this can we exchange or kill
me

104
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:53,790
can we find some some common interest
and of course is version 001 was a

105
00:13:53,790 --> 00:14:02,189
proof-of-concept we had to have one in
order to kinda sell the idea and your

106
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:06,689
order to do anything we needed a team
but that team was

107
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:16,890
the kinda afterthought and the reason it
was an afterthought be aids because we

108
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:21,449
knew each other for years and we didn't
think about a team we were already

109
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:27,150
drinking beer together so let's do
something together but i have to point

110
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:38,189
out it's really really important . and
don't neglect your team so funding was

111
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:50,460
as a funding on its own was a project
way with its ups and downs awaits

112
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:01,050
we're with problems that we were luckily
we were lucky to solve one-on-one

113
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:07,050
interesting way and interesting way what
was that we encountered a guy dad said

114
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:16,109
okay I really am stuck with some client
and I know you guys from the previous

115
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:22,590
projects can use speed up development
please on this and this and that

116
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:30,810
happened to us and we were kind enough
to say okay cower expanses of a

117
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:37,229
hackerspace and we will make it happen
so that was happening for two months

118
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:47,610
that that was the funding for and we
ended up being better at project

119
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,610
management and management

120
00:15:50,610 --> 00:16:01,080
overall we kept it kind of fun that that
that funding side we kept fun as much as

121
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:08,560
possible and actually our landlords
helped the

122
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:17,500
everyone involved in till the center is
a hackerspace were super cool and

123
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:25,600
helpful so it kinda didn't fail if we
put enough brainpower and we'll into it

124
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,410
so it was funny in a way its own ways
and you're going to discover on your own

125
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,800
how it is bad a project

126
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:45,790
well we're were system means for 290
fifth time and we're lazy of course so

127
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:50,949
that the only product and the only way
of solving a problem we know is

128
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:57,250
automation so we did it and a huge part
of that is answerable if you never heard

129
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,200
of defensible please do look up the
windows and it's super easy to install

130
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:08,230
so automation everywhere generators
everywhere so don't write your own code

131
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:17,860
it's terrible but the project was
interesting because of 11 collaborative

132
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:24,369
effort and its new people and old people
that know each other I have no idea

133
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:32,500
what's going on how do you how do you
cope with it and me personally as a

134
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:38,770
technical person I'm not really good
with people and then that that that was

135
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:49,960
my obstacle and my challenge to to solve
and rejecting ideas and pool requests

136
00:17:49,960 --> 00:18:01,840
and in some people was hard and
desirable to protect the rest of the

137
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:11,080
project and the rest of the team from
the fools and from the wrong route and I

138
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,090
read once

139
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:21,129
I think it was Jesse frazzle who said
for a pool request and the project's

140
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:27,430
your your maintainer off saying you know
it's it's a temporary thing because when

141
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:33,940
i say okay this can go i give you the
reasons or can work on this can we

142
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:41,410
improve that but saying yes is accepting
the the pool request or a person in a

143
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:47,770
team who can destroy it and you have to
be careful about it so the reason i'm

144
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:55,840
emphasizing saying no is a be careful
for you we choose to be like your

145
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,840
friends i'm not saying it is your father
but I didn't sound like it and a project

146
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,139
is your baby so you kind of have this
parental thing going on with your

147
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:15,820
project and just slip into emotions
sooner or later and I'm so the project

148
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:23,800
didn't end by the funding did and now we
can do something with it

149
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:34,750
honestly the thing we were asked to do
was totally not fun it was Asia API and

150
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:40,540
we couldn't figure it out in two months
if anyone can figure it out please let

151
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:47,889
us know we were not smart enough to do
it which microsoft support help it was

152
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,240
that ridiculous

153
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:57,790
so after the funding stop we could
really do some cool stuff away we could

154
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:03,580
break the project again if we wanted to
and we wanted to because it was ugly and

155
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,269
we needed some new design

156
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:15,209
and new rope and it's a wonderful new
opportunity for new ideas and because

157
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:24,059
we're already kinda breaking the project
we are keeping the version stable but

158
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:32,369
God forbid if we have something stable
right now and I'm master wrench so it's

159
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:43,049
a it's a start of some new ideas and
your research but we kind of cool our

160
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:51,479
heads we with the research right now so
it's it's also time to invite new people

161
00:20:51,479 --> 00:21:00,659
now that we finally know what we're
doing and any physical entity has its

162
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:07,739
own inertia so does a project always
were a virtual but it has this inertia

163
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:19,289
of cool people doing cool stuff and we
kept on doing it and that inertia gave

164
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:24,809
birth to some other projects that are on
the same stack based on the same stack

165
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:34,559
and are totally different than what I
hope for which is great i really love

166
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:44,908
diversity as so that inertia is a is
kind of important and once that that

167
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:49,589
real good feeling stops inertia keeps on
going and don't neglect

168
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:58,010
so what we're doing right now what I'm
doing right this second is putting the

169
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:04,970
word out we're out of funding and we are
in for the new people so that's

170
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:13,220
basically putting the word out and we
think of scaling not only as system

171
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:22,970
means although I I'm afraid we're gonna
use the same solutions but there that

172
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:32,060
this is only one project and it's only
one license since then we some of us

173
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:42,139
grow to like PSD and we want to expand
that even legally so and we don't know

174
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,140
how to do it where we don't know what
are the consequences

175
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:53,660
so not only the digital world has to
scale it's it's our knowledge and it's

176
00:22:53,660 --> 00:23:05,840
our membership and as a project is now
in a in a alpha state I I did my best

177
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:15,830
and inspiring people to write docks and
we have pretty much covered it all but

178
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:24,409
we need people who are not so technical
as we are as we need proper a new

179
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:30,560
perspective into a project we can't
explain it to people what it is

180
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,710
normal people are

181
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:39,680
I kind of said you're not normal sorry
check that but Yamin

182
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:47,950
I could talk to you about these IDs and
you're not in a position where you need

183
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:54,340
a spoon feeding and for the people you
trying to ask for money you need to

184
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:01,509
spoon-feed them so we don't know how to
properly put it into docs so if you know

185
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:07,929
it please let us know we were more than
willing to listen to you so that was all

186
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:15,279
by me and if you have any questions
please if you can use the mic please do

187
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:22,120
know

188
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:30,970
okay so we're gonna have a torture
hackerspace which is I don't know seven

189
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,970
minutes in that direction by foot

190
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:43,539
follow the beautiful lady with similar
shirt in 3pm and thank you for being

191
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:47,110
here even on on hangover

192
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,990
yeah
