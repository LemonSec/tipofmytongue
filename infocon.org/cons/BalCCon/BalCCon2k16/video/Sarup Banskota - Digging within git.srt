1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:26,550
okay our first lecture for today is by
syrup against Kota and it's called

2
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,550
digging within get enjoy

3
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,470
hello it's my first time in Serbia so
first of all hello serbia hello beside

4
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:50,700
as you can probably tell i usually am
found mostly in Asia that that's like my

5
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,160
usual happy that and in Asia when we
start conferences there's like a little

6
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,148
custom you do before you start usually
test the microphone make hello can you

7
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:00,809
hear me

8
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,700
but but apparently it's not not that
very you know things just work here

9
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,200
so when I'm when I'm presenting a
conference in asia i usually have it

10
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,340
covered make I usually come with a few
jokes or something like that for the

11
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,690
time period where there where the laptop
is being set up the microphone is being

12
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,440
set up

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,560
unfortunately none for you because
everything covered so I wanted to begin

14
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,180
by thanking everyone for having me here
we'll be talking a little bit about get

15
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,930
as the sleigh as the slide says and
thank you organizers for making it so

16
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,420
easy in fact you usually i mean i was
telling the guy i'm staying with in the

17
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,650
same place and and then when I was
underway i was telling him that it's my

18
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,280
first day I've ever starting a
conference on the last day the first

19
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,509
talk and usually that's that's a tricky
one because mostly people are drunk the

20
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,860
previous night right i mean i can see
look look at him is it shows on his face

21
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,979
so you don't miss her drunk people on on
the first thing they're listening to in

22
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,139
the morning and the worst thing you can
do to

23
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,279
drunk guys and girls the first talk in
the morning is to talk about a subject

24
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,290
like it

25
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,700
and yesterday i was writing a bunch of
slides sitting in a cafe and just

26
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,859
crawling critter and interesting shut up

27
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,890
apparently two days back somebody made a
little website about you know ship get

28
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,790
and i will leave that out for you it
says get documentation has this chicken

29
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,660
and egg problem where you can search for
how to get yourself out of a mess

30
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,769
unless you already know not know of the
thing that you need to know about in

31
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:45,340
order to fix their problems so this is
my story a few years ago I was also new

32
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:52,030
to a computer and in the first place and
definitely to get and I had just started

33
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,739
to write simple programs in my
university and somebody told me try this

34
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:57,670
thing out

35
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,869
it's called get it's very useful and i
was i was googling right and I first

36
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,010
thing I google was one of the first
things I did it so fast available

37
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,489
distribution revision control system and
that sounds like something out of

38
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:15,790
someone's linkedin profile and it was
too much to grab at first and although

39
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,269
of course over time once i started using
it more and more it started to make

40
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:24,489
sense and everything was quite useful
and once you kind of get the handles it

41
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,390
you you learn it the hard way that at
the end of the day it is a stupid

42
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,649
content tracker and this is not making
it up you can check up like mandate and

43
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,570
that's what it would say so this talk is
a little bit

44
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:42,489
it's not really about how to use get
it's more about how get internally works

45
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:46,329
and i will give you a little bit of
background just to do a little

46
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:50,950
motivation about way why this is useful
why we should try to understand so for

47
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,850
me I'm a designer i'm actually not that
much of a programmer although i do

48
00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:00,400
program and a few years ago I was I was
complaining about how design tools and

49
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,410
you know very very nice

50
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,980
so for designers we had a lot of
problems collaborating whenever you want

51
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,679
to collaborate on design work and we
don't have

52
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,390
something like our github equivalent
well you know you really have the social

53
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,829
place where you can go and do your
design stuff and since we didn't have 1i

54
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:21,639
decided to start helping create one and
i was involved with a project which

55
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,780
basically tried to be a guitar for
open-source designers and while I was

56
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,070
making it there were two problems I had
to understand a bit of how it works

57
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,900
because that software was get back and
i'm a designer that's short for saying I

58
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,880
have a problem I don't really know
what's happening here and and i started

59
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,009
with everything and get like like like
that website whenever you want to do a

60
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:45,550
much

61
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,289
ok i said i tried to do a marg once and
then it created a march comment for me

62
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:54,310
fair enough then a few days later i made
another much but this time there was no

63
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,449
more comment and so what what happened
it's the same try kind of thing

64
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:03,280
three days later I wanted to do a rebase
and that happened because I somehow

65
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,059
screwed up my project history and one of
the more experienced ladies I was

66
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,080
working with said my you should probably
replace it and then and then send the

67
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,580
pull request again so I mean ego issues
i could ask her exactly what every basis

68
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,870
i went and googled it i tried to do the
best I could and I rebased and somehow

69
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,280
all the comments in the history and this
was about 60 comments in a pull request

70
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,229
speak about bad practices and all of
them somehow had never come with she

71
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:33,880
wrote and they appeared there somehow
and my face was on top of her face on

72
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,560
github and I really didn't know what was
going on so it's such stuff they never

73
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,139
made sense to me and over trying to
build this tool and fixing some of my

74
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:48,400
own problems i struggled and I to
understand how it works and i thought i

75
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,190
should share it with you so let's start
so the basic idea is indeed we have

76
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,240
something called porcelain commands and
plumbing comments i don't really know

77
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,030
why their name that but that's how it is

78
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:07,570
porcelain is like the front and sort of
user facing the commands that you are

79
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,430
expected to use more often unless you
are scripting or something like that and

80
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,810
plumbing is what gets you this
internally to you know make those things

81
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,540
happen and

82
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,770
and you probably don't use plumbing
commands on a day-to-day basis unless

83
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:29,969
you are doing something with get or 88 a
script or something of that sort and I

84
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,320
actually I'm not very sure how much you
know in what they're after

85
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,270
what kind of explanation i will need to
do but let's let's start with the let's

86
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,270
start with the basics i will have to
switch my

87
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:54,479
you can see another problem I side took
when i was in serbia one of the issues

88
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,889
when you come from Asia as i'm typically
shorter so every cafe want to go and eat

89
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:02,909
food in its like hey can you get me the
food and then my laptop is here and i

90
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:08,699
have to type like that so I'm sure it's
the same thing with the with the

91
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:23,909
terminal so let's make sure you can see
it more and you see okay what okay

92
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,760
good enough ok

93
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,650
so let's try it let's try just creating
a repository let's call it

94
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:46,390
balkon and would anybody tell me what is
the porcelain command for creating a new

95
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:56,890
like how to initialize get within a
repository what would that be okay so we

96
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:03,070
did that and so now here it's worth
mentioning that most of it's magic it's

97
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,870
it lies inside this repository called .
get and that's why my talk was called

98
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,010
begin within . get and oops

99
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:24,460
yeah and now let's say let's try to see
what's in it so i will do right so there

100
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,710
are a bunch of things inside it and
usually in your daily course of work if

101
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,610
you're doing software projects making
applications you probably don't want to

102
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,570
go in here and do things this is this is
only when you want to understand what's

103
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:44,890
happening behind the scenes so that's
that's that and you will see that that's

104
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:50,740
the same thing now all of this is not
really relevant to this topic because we

105
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,750
will try to keep it simple will talk
about the key concepts after which you

106
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,440
can always go back and construct other
things from it so the things we really

107
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,710
want to worry about to the division of
the stock are the head file objects and

108
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,880
rest the key

109
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,880
ok

110
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,340
ok I'll just explain what is going on
there so at its core get is a persistent

111
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:24,620
attachment you get content and it
converts it to a half and then this

112
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,860
house gets thrown around so that's
that's basically what happens

113
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:35,360
let's try to do something for example
let's just say i want

114
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,230
okay there's this coming command i'll
introduce you to it's called get hash

115
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,730
object and what it does is it takes some
content and it converts it to ash

116
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:54,650
so let's try to make one let's let's
make something called people and i will

117
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,270
type it here and we're taking it from
standard input usually have subject

118
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:05,540
expects a file but we are taking it here
and and you will see it it returns ash

119
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:14,240
so this pretty much represents what's in
it and let's see what happened I mean we

120
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,870
did something inside a git repository
and we already initialized to get

121
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,200
repository and so far we run this
command so you would expect that

122
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,020
somewhere there should be some you know
their friends to it so i will try to do

123
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,689
this again

124
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:36,740
actually let's do but really nothing new
is there it's just just what it was

125
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,550
before

126
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:42,349
so what happened was we didn't persisted
and to persist that we can do this right

127
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:48,620
flag and once we do that we can actually
look inside the objects people and you

128
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,480
will see that a new a new file has been
created and there's a convention if you

129
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:00,890
observe this string here and this pot
the first two characters have been made

130
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,790
a directory and the rest of the stuff
was gone within now i'll introduce you

131
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,449
to another one another one coming
command

132
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,430
it's called cat file and get file is
basically like some sort of Inspector

133
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,959
you give it something and it will show
you what what's in it so I'm just going

134
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,240
to take the first few characters of the
string here

135
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,899
and I will pass it to cat file and it's
sorry i also need to pass a flag so

136
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:34,320
there are 22 commonly use flex one is
tnp so if I used t it's going to tell me

137
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,550
that it's a blob

138
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,670
that's good way of saying that's content

139
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:43,800
ok something like that and you might
wonder we wrote people waited that

140
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,550
disappear I mean it doesn't seem to show
anyway and in the whole git repository

141
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:58,680
so it's actually within this this is so
what's happening here is get cat file is

142
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,109
almost like think of it like some sort
of doing a cat operation but then it's

143
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:10,620
it's it's looking inside what what's in
that weird object so that that content

144
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,620
that you had sent people it's now saved
in this one so let's look at what files

145
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,310
we have again and right now we have we
have this so let's go back

146
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,640
yeah so that's just a string and you
take any unique string it's going to

147
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,890
return your unique sure that's another
thing to note and now let's try to

148
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,270
visually to something

149
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,569
actually I wrote a little script before
I came here simple one

150
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:42,060
let's run but so I'm just going to for
the sake of simplicity I will try and

151
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,060
create a repository quickly

152
00:12:52,430 --> 00:13:03,290
and you will see that i have created
something called get repo and and

153
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,920
they're there are that's what the
structure looks like so whats there it's

154
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,279
it's a directory called the triple
inside which there's another directory

155
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:15,439
called Friday inside which there are two
other files and at its root there's also

156
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,720
another one called read me . margin and
these are the files in this directory

157
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:29,300
there's no get initialized yet so now
let's let's try to enter this one and

158
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:39,649
we'll initialize get here and as you can
see that guy has been created and we'll

159
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:42,649
just make a comment at this point

160
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,560
let's just call it first for simplicity

161
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,979
so you have some information now there's
this weird screen again and then it says

162
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,020
which files got added and so on so
that's the comment like let's try to

163
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,040
visually look at this and what's what's
in it

164
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,819
we don't know yet so let's try to
inspect you are already returned this

165
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,160
string so I will take that and i will
try to do a cat file with it to first

166
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,920
see what type this and it says it's a
comet which tells us that that's how

167
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,439
come it's are represented and then let's
try to now see what's in the comment

168
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:32,370
what do you expect to see in the comment
let's begin with that anybody the name

169
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:41,130
of the files what we expect a diff mhm
the content of the files any more

170
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:41,850
answers

171
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,089
ok let's let's just stick with that

172
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:50,370
so we're going to look at what's within
this what's within this and we'll check

173
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:56,339
i'm sorry it's a bit but you can I think
you can make out

174
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:01,710
it basically has what looks like a bit
of meta information it has my name and

175
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,430
it has other things like timestamp and
then there's something called the tree

176
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,359
and then there's the commit message that
is specified but there doesn't seem to

177
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,110
be any reference to the files that i
created not the content so it's a bit

178
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,860
funny i'll try to break this down for
you

179
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,780
now what you see here that is literally
to commit this is not my information

180
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:27,240
this is literally exactly its comment
and what happened here is that each

181
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,709
comment its kind of pointing to
something called a tree and that we will

182
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:36,719
think of a tree like some kind of
directly please can contain other trees

183
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,709
and it can contain blobs blogs are what
I explained already there are just

184
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:45,359
pieces of content and trees contain
other trees and you can navigate just

185
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,630
like a good i don't like a filesystem
and let's try to inspect what's in the

186
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:58,380
tree right so by the way I just I just
not it done this year so that

187
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,820
and like just a representation the black
stuff is the comment and then this thing

188
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:08,310
here that's the that's the tree for that
comment and now we'll try to inspect

189
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,310
will try to inspect what's in that tree

190
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:19,290
so let's do helps keep doing it all the
time so if i take the type for that one

191
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:25,050
it does me to treat this like I expected
and we allow try to see what's actually

192
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:34,859
in it and there you go you see that
there are there's a reference to a blob

193
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:42,029
and there's there's the file name which
you are familiar with and there's also

194
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:43,740
another directory within it

195
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:49,019
so let's try to visually represent this
what happened is inside the comment

196
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:52,920
there is a reference to it street and
inside that tree there is a reference to

197
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,170
another treat which is referencing
friday and there is a reference to this

198
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,529
blog and if you dig further

199
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,579
ok let's let's see what's in the blob
right so let's take some of this some

200
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:14,010
part of this thing and we are just
trying to see what's in the blog so

201
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:19,470
first of all let's do to make sure
that's indeed the blood we want and now

202
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:27,750
but that's that's where that's where the
content of that file was so what we had

203
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:34,049
saved in that file is within its within
this blob so i will walk into that once

204
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:35,580
more so that we are here

205
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,260
first there's the comment which is
referencing to its tree and that he has

206
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:46,110
reference to another tree and it has
reference to another blob and the name

207
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:50,610
of that file which has that content is
actually in its tree it's not in the

208
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:56,610
file itself there is no file which has
you know there is no standard on file

209
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:06,899
and the content of that of that file is
actually within within this blob ok and

210
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,080
you could also take further

211
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,879
I'm struggling a bit with the sighs okay
let's clear this

212
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,330
yeah

213
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,230
so I'm starting with that comment again

214
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:40,600
and i found the tree of that comment and
now I'm just seeing what's inside that

215
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,560
tree and we already saw that there's a
blog now let's try to go inside another

216
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:54,190
tree so it's fair to do and you see that
that tree has more blogs within it

217
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,860
so basically they're sort of like the
structure of that deposit a directory

218
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,850
that you had it was now kind of
replicated here in this tree structure

219
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:10,480
and then there are two blobs and I think
it should be obvious by now that if we

220
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:18,100
check out what's in the blob what do you
expect what do you expect Insider blog

221
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,490
ok cool so that's fine

222
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:32,139
so that's our representation so far
let's try to make another comment just

223
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,240
for fun I actually memorized the string
that I want to change so that the shows

224
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:48,400
are the same so we'll go inside friday
and i will change the file called people

225
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:55,630
more people because we are like it and
it's been

226
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,310
ok

227
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:07,120
let's call it second right so that's
that's our situation at this point and

228
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,810
this comment has a hash and let's

229
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:22,240
and as you expect okay i think i messed
up on the phylum somewhere but

230
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,690
essentially what happens is that this
commit now has a reference to another

231
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,810
tree and if you open that that tree

232
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,620
you will see the same structure that we
had before and this factor is there in

233
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,310
that fashion because we didn't really
change the structure of our dietary all

234
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:47,120
we really did was change the content of
one file now let's try to really

235
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:54,320
understand this i just hope I'm not
going too fast or something so we change

236
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,909
the content of just one file right so
that's there and why is that a new

237
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:05,270
reference because that's a new file its
new content so it gets its own blob and

238
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:10,610
there's a new link to it but there was
one directory in our project the Friday

239
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,570
directory that you see here which wich
good reference here we don't know

240
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,470
anything about it in the second commit
so what do you expect would happen to it

241
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:28,909
do you think we would create a new like
new link with the with a new tree and

242
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:34,820
ideas just link it right exactly

243
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,929
smart so it's just going to reuse what
you already have this not going to be

244
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:45,170
anything new there i'm gonna let it
parse

245
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:50,678
that's what happened there

246
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:57,039
ok so we'll walk to this once more
quickly so that the sequence is clear

247
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,389
I'm sorry if this comes across is boring
to some people but there was a commit

248
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:06,340
its reference it's linking to a tree and
then there's another tree there and a

249
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:12,549
blob the blog has the content and then
there are two files which are linked to

250
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:15,639
blogs in that tree and there's a second
commit

251
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:22,178
ok so at this point you pretty much
understand at a high level

252
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,749
what's happening in the background
whenever you write comments that's

253
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:30,909
really all you need to know now let's
think about what do you how do you think

254
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:34,990
when let's say your change comments
right you go you check out one of the

255
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,529
comment and you want to see what's
happening in that comment so how do you

256
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:42,970
think it actually figures out that this
other stuff that you need to see on this

257
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,529
comet like would you expect there to be
a day for this mechanism you must have

258
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:51,129
heard of the term snapshot a lot like
when you when you do the good stuff i

259
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:56,049
never got that I mean snapchat what's
what's this snapshot is it sounds like a

260
00:22:56,049 --> 00:23:01,749
photograph kinky but not quite this this
system makes it super-easy forget to

261
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:07,360
track anything so how get finds out
figures out what content to include in

262
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,949
any comet basically you take whatever
committee want and then you traverse

263
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,289
from that point

264
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:19,059
everywhere you can reach so you let's
take first you can reach here from there

265
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:22,928
you can reach here you cannot reach here
because it's an inverse direction you

266
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:27,009
can reach here you can reach here so
this would be the stuff that's included

267
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:28,149
in the first comment

268
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:32,678
let's talk about the second comment
where can you go if you started from the

269
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:37,269
second comment you could go here you
could go here you could go here you

270
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:43,779
can't really go here and so on so a
snapshot is basically just following the

271
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:46,779
but wherever you can go and that's
really all there is

272
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:52,149
so

273
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:18,640
no you would you would go to the blob to
the blob and what I didn't quite

274
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,500
understand how we would go back to the
first okay later

275
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:35,260
cool that that's why i mean it's it's a
bad idea to do a snap sure it's

276
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:40,750
essentially what can you see on that
commits that's basically the snapshot

277
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:47,830
yeah and where can you reach and
basically if if you are at any point in

278
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,820
your project history you are on some
comment right so what can i see at this

279
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,960
point what am I accessible that's the
snapshot and the comet is just the

280
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,570
representation for that thing in it

281
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,590
ok let's talk about grunting now that
this is the second freaked out that I

282
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:08,320
had when I was when I was thinking so
right now our setup pretty much looks

283
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:16,870
like that there are two commits and this
is what there's a brunch

284
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:30,299
Master so we'll just put a little thing
there and i think i will have to do this

285
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:36,629
little bit visually but ok so that there
are two things here let's talk about

286
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:41,309
let's talk about that first so there's
there's a branch master and now you

287
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:43,918
would wonder where is this master thing
I mean how

288
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,080
where is it saved because clearly we
didn't have it in that objects a guide

289
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:59,549
there was no reference to it we can
verify oops that's a lot of force but

290
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:04,500
that there is no reference just trust me
and now we'll just go to rest I will

291
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,850
save you the trouble and you will see
this thing called heads and that's where

292
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:12,629
that's where the reference to the other
brands that you create they are

293
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,990
basically kept their let's create a
branch and then it will be more clear

294
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:25,530
so let's get a branch called fixes and i
will do the same thing and you will see

295
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,980
that it got there for those of you who
find it easier to look at it visually

296
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,980
maybe I can

297
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:41,690
yeah so all the stuff which was the game
object database that's here

298
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,919
ignore the info and pack for now that's
more forget to make things quicker but

299
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,910
this is basically all the stuff that we
were looking at these objects we created

300
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:56,990
and the references like the branch names
there here there are just two files with

301
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,669
with them and one might wonder what
watching it it's just a simple text file

302
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:04,669
so let's try to do

303
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:17,120
and it links to something I mean you see
you see another show so let's try to see

304
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,330
what this show is all about

305
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,330
actually I think I've seen this before

306
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,380
so

307
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,930
if you notice that one this is this is
the same show here so it's basically our

308
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,930
second comment but let's try it

309
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:51,560
yeah it's ended it ended that comment so
that's where so what-what that branch

310
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,639
file contains is a link to that last
comment where it was standing where it

311
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,620
wherever it was pointing to then there's
this famous thing called head

312
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:06,199
everybody knows head and if you just
check out all the branches we've got

313
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,430
we've got two branches fixes and master
and master is bright and green and nice

314
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,710
and fixes is not really

315
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:16,220
so where is this information contained
about which branch and I currently on

316
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,810
that's that's another thing were
wondering about so this is actually

317
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:27,710
there in a file called head and let's
let's find it

318
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:41,230
there's this file head and that
basically contains you know the

319
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:48,100
reference to which branch is currently
are on so let's let's do it and you will

320
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,748
see that there's a link to link to the
current branch around if you don't

321
00:28:52,749 --> 00:29:01,659
believe me we can actually switch
branches so let's do and you will see

322
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:05,739
that the reference has changed so next
time if you if you want to feel geeky

323
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:09,369
and you want to change branches you
don't forget check out thing you know

324
00:29:09,369 --> 00:29:13,269
which file to go and change right just
getting don't try it

325
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,210
yeah that's it let me okay

326
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:24,820
from this point onwards I will try to
not do much of a demo other ways it's

327
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:31,658
going to get the public tricky so i will
try to use the visual representations ok

328
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:37,450
so we we stopped at that point right we
we basically had two commits and there

329
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,450
was master and fixes two branches

330
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:49,340
would I think it goes in there ok so
there are two commits and there are two

331
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:54,980
ranches and head is pointing to that
master thing now let's try to create a

332
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,730
new comment

333
00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:02,779
so we create a new computer and what
would you expect to change with master

334
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:05,600
and fixes what do you think that would
have change

335
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,090
we didn't switch branches so we expect
had to change know so it doesn't change

336
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:16,189
we didn't really do much it fixes so
fixes didn't change so obviously master

337
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:21,590
changed and what happened was master
moved and it pointed to the third common

338
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:27,080
and and had just moved along with master
because it already dif different secret

339
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:37,850
ok so now now we want to switch branches
so what we did was we switch from we

340
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:43,070
were here before we were on mastered and
i just did a good check out fixes and

341
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:49,340
all that happened was the reference the
head now points to fixes that that's

342
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,928
what it looks like

343
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:54,590
let's try to clean this up a little bit
and it's the same same reference and

344
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,658
just making it look nicer

345
00:30:56,659 --> 00:31:00,019
let's write up let's start to emerge

346
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:05,480
so what we want to do is we want too
much those two branches and this is a

347
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,990
very tricky thing I mean what what
exactly did happen when i created a much

348
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,059
so what good does it

349
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:17,059
it creates a new commit the much comment
which is very famous and and then it

350
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:22,460
most the reference of that branch up to
that much commit so now both of those

351
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,860
things are contender

352
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,949
that's how March works till this point
it is fairly straightforward

353
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:33,259
now let's let me ask a question so
imagine that there

354
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:37,610
this is the March commit and we are here
on master and let's say I wanted too

355
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,678
much the branches

356
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:46,639
I mean this I want to merge these two so
what we expect would happen would create

357
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:52,248
a new much comment and then you know but
there was there would be expected to

358
00:31:52,249 --> 00:31:52,850
that

359
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,639
yeah I agree

360
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:01,820
so just to repeat the question there are
two there's a much here there's that

361
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:06,740
other committee last comment on master
and i just want too much these two what

362
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,300
what would happen I mean we create a new
new note here and just kind of much it

363
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:19,070
that's what we would expect but getting
smart so it basically just moves that

364
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,679
guy there because think about what
you're trying to achieve you're just

365
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,570
doing something that's already there and
this my friends is exactly what happens

366
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:31,610
when you do a fast forward and every
time you see that fast forward thingy

367
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:35,570
this is what happened basically that's
good congratulating you for saving an

368
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,500
extra comment

369
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,040
yeah so that's that

370
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:46,280
now i think i'm going towards the end of
my talk and i would like to end by

371
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,330
explaining how rebase works that's quite
interesting

372
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,730
so that's the scenario let's go let's
assume that's our scenario right now and

373
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:01,100
we would like to we would like to
basically take this fort and fifth and

374
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:05,750
put it over second and third that that's
how we want to maintain our history

375
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:11,180
so what we're trying to achieve is we
want to take that guy and put it on top

376
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:20,240
here now how would we do that i mean you
can't really is if you did anything to

377
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,210
do it if you change this link you would
be changing the parent I don't know if I

378
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:31,190
show you that by the way so I'm sorry
just a moment

379
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,360
oops I'm stuck

380
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,850
I'm a little stuck actually I can't
remove it okay it's fine i just i just

381
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:51,800
explained this week so I'm sorry i have
created a condition where I cannot go

382
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,690
back to the other other screen but
essentially what you want to create is

383
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:02,300
you want to take fourth and fifth and
move them on top of 2nd and 3rd that's

384
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,169
what you want to achieve and what
happens is every comment also has

385
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:09,980
something called a parent and that's
basically linking to the parent commit

386
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:15,350
to commit before it and now if you have
to change if you want to change the link

387
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:20,779
you will be changing the comment itself
which is not fair because common objects

388
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:27,380
are immutable so what it will do is it
will cheat and what's going to happen is

389
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:33,200
i had slides for this but maybe you can
check them up later essentially fourth

390
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,239
and fifth there will be two exactly same
content from and commits newcomers

391
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,918
created with new shower and everything
and it will point to third and then and

392
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:47,600
then . 250 so that's not this commit
morning anyway the commentary list is

393
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,130
where it is there are two new commits
created specifically for that rivers and

394
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:56,330
they will contain the same properties as
these and they will move on top of 2nd

395
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:03,049
and 3rd and now you can imagine if you
move there and and this branch reference

396
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:09,830
will move to the top so there's no way
to reach these guys anymore because you

397
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:14,509
have now created your now 112 that
branch so once there is no way to reach

398
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:17,510
a few comments what do you think it
would do it

399
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:31,190
any ideas he threw them away and it was
going to do so yeah I mean I had

400
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,600
somebody say it's it's going to keep
them for a while and so somebody i think

401
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,069
i heard garbage collection must be this
you guys and yeah exactly so that's

402
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:43,520
what's gonna happen it's going to keep
them around for a while and let it chill

403
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,470
and after a point in time when it does
no longer needs them it's just going to

404
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,279
throw them away

405
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:56,570
yeah that's that's basically all there
that is there's understand here i had

406
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:00,680
the last light which said thank you in
Serbian i think was it how la la la la

407
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,500
la sao paulo thank you

408
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,500
thatthat's

409
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,578
yeah
