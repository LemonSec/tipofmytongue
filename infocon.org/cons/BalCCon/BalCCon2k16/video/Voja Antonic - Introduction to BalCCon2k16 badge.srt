1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:26,740
my antics will be presenting the batch
small introduction how it's working

2
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:39,309
I will not take you to much time I just
have thought explain you how to use your

3
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:44,108
bedroom hope that you all you all have
your badges and that you tried to switch

4
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:54,550
it on to you have the PDF manual on the
side i hope the official seeed son Marco

5
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:02,108
please you have the PDF on the site and
you can you can you have all the all the

6
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:08,950
options in that video we shall we shall
see soon okay

7
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,550
this lets go to the PDF

8
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,690
yes that's it thank you very much

9
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:29,240
huh there are three basic functions one
of them is just the bed streets use the

10
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:36,410
just dodo let something roll let's let
something happen while you have your veg

11
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:42,560
when you switch it on it starts playing
some predefined patterns there are about

12
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:51,020
50 patterns here and they are played at
random but random the interesting thing

13
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:58,550
is that when two badges spot each other
because they they have the the infrared

14
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:06,140
communication or when they spot each
other they synchronize and they play the

15
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,270
patterns synchronized all at the same
time a little faster and at the same

16
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:19,760
time the same patterns so we shall have
the when you when you are when there are

17
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,750
more badges then they they will be
socialized as we used to say there is

18
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:37,670
that that the main flow chart of the
operation when you press the lower

19
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,510
button you switch on or off the badge

20
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:47,090
that's all for the beginning when you
keep it pressed when you keep it pressed

21
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,650
a little longer

22
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:58,970
you see now and now you have the only
that the the medium the central that led

23
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:08,720
is is switched on and now it works like
BB gun I guess that you know what this

24
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,609
DB gone we had the mich Altman as our
guest two years ago

25
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:21,500
it's his product and he was kind to let
us use his idea in this veg you can

26
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:27,610
switch off or all TV sets around the old
when you switch it on

27
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:35,410
a you menya you don't want the TV when
there is some restaurants or some cafe

28
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:45,040
or or anywhere that you you don't like
the theory then you switch on this BB

29
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,030
gun

30
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,870
hold this button a little longer

31
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:59,770
yes and it will be or it will be
automatic automatically switched off so

32
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:08,890
it works like the remote TV control for
all tvs but with only one command with

33
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:19,209
command switch off if you don't want to
be spotted like someone who like a

34
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:25,210
terrorist complete switch is off the TVs
you have to press the upper button and

35
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:31,900
then it works in silent mouth in blind
mouth leds which stuff but it is still

36
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:38,799
working is still working the end it's
still switches of the TV so so you can

37
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:47,560
use it in in the blind the mouth it will
be switched off automatically after some

38
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,860
time when it when he throws all the
calls there are about 220 codes for for

39
00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:00,130
our most theories when he throws

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,130
the the whole the whole list of codes
then it will be switched off

41
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,350
automatically but you can switch off
also by pressing the lower button you

42
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:22,030
see now when it works you sweet again
and and the switch it to you press the

43
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:28,869
button again and switch it off the third
part function is password manager so

44
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:37,450
makaveli please scroll down the password
manager yes yes

45
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:44,800
it'sit's well a little more yes it's
okay here

46
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,430
thank you when you guys know the upper
button you are in password manager mouth

47
00:05:51,430 --> 00:06:03,220
only one thing led is is on when you
repeatedly press the upper button again

48
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:09,250
and again you switch the next LED and so
on the whole circle you see you have

49
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:18,280
also the outer repeat function so you
have attend password it can manage up to

50
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:28,929
10 passwords and you mean first you
select one or over those LEDs there are

51
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:36,580
12 of them but the first ten leds are
active now you select the password that

52
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,120
you want to use and you just plug it in
there

53
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:50,270
in your computer in USB part it will
connect as the USB keyboard so it

54
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:58,609
emulate the keyboard and when you plug
it in your computer you will it will

55
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:05,479
automatically type that password the
type the password that you selected how

56
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:12,199
to generate your passwords at the first
moments all passwords are empty now you

57
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,199
have to generate new passwords

58
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:22,820
let's say you know you want to generate
password the number one hold this button

59
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:30,080
a little longer while you get the red
LED in the center in the middle value

60
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,560
while you get it on in the middle then
you select the password that you want to

61
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:45,320
generate the to change the password i
selected the number one and you plug it

62
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:55,039
in your computer when the when it is
when the USB parties synchronize their

63
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:02,300
the enumeration process is finished when
this led stops blinking you can generate

64
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,160
new password by pressing the upper
button again when you pressed it you

65
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,740
will see that password completely new
password which is generated by Iran

66
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:22,970
random number generator it contains a 15
to 20 characters but the the number of

67
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:31,580
characters is also random you have you
will get 15 to 20 characters which

68
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,848
contain

69
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:41,130
digits also it's your new password you
can repeat about by pressing this upper

70
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:47,399
button again when you switch it off when
your blog it off from your usb part it

71
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:54,360
will be sweet stuff to automatically
then you can use that password each time

72
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:02,940
you plug it in your USB port you will it
will be automatically type that password

73
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:09,209
is kept in the flesh from of this
microcontroller so you don't you will

74
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:16,529
not lose it when you put in your replace
your battery and you it will be not

75
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:26,910
changed until the new process for for
password forge new password generation

76
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:38,610
so you can generate then passwords which
are completely unique and the LED number

77
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,319
11

78
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:45,719
just a moment with now

79
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:54,770
first ten digits are for ten passwords
number 11 is mark just like a letter L

80
00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:02,689
that means password least when you
select this led it's blue LED with that

81
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:11,300
with the letter L and you plug it in
your USB port but please before that you

82
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:22,040
have to to open some text editor it will
emulate the keyboard again and type your

83
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:30,020
password list in the text editor you see
those numbers USC password least 13 that

84
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:35,900
means that you invoked your password
least 13 times it's just the counter how

85
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:43,550
many times did you print it in your
password editor after each password you

86
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:51,290
see those password are marked with
numbers 029 it's a bug it's my party in

87
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:59,569
the program i'm sorry he here on on the
PCB there they're marked from number one

88
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:04,610
to number zero at the end but here are
their mark that number 202 number not in

89
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:11,720
9 i'm sorry it's it's a backpack here
you have to keep it in your mind as I

90
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:18,680
yet so a number one here is number 0
here said I'm sorry after the password

91
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:25,339
you will see the number of which tells
you how many times did you use that

92
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,510
password if you want to track this
number

93
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:36,830
did someone use it in instead of your I
don't know what you can see how many

94
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,730
times the you use it when you generate
the new password that counter

95
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:48,140
automatically resets to zero of course
and the last function is a function

96
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:59,000
our it's the the last led here is the
random number generator it's it also

97
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,640
stimulates the keyboard and types in
your text editor it types the random

98
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:16,699
number stream it's the a-10 infinite
stream and in infinite string are you

99
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:25,580
can you can stop it other problem ever
power Z 2 by pressing the upper button

100
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:32,060
again and maybe this seems a little
confusing here but you have all that

101
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:40,699
explained in this file and I hope that
it will be simple enough and clear

102
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,720
enough

103
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,940
another thing that i have dimension
within which was not mentioned in this

104
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:55,820
PDF file because it was added at the
last minute is the power automatic power

105
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:01,700
of it turned out that you can switch it
on

106
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:08,479
unintentionally while it is in your
pocket or so so it will be switched off

107
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:15,020
after one hour operation if you wanted
to use it more than one hour here you

108
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:21,079
have to switch it on again it's one hour
in bed more than the 10 minutes in

109
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,340
password manager month it will be
switched off that's all if you have some

110
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,650
questions I'll be here around and i'll
be glad to answer you thank you very

111
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,350
much

112
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,770
yeah
