1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:24,670
Daniel graph will be presenting nature
Darwin and bug bounty hunting when the

2
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,570
QA Q&A starts you'll be going to the
microphone and speaking

3
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:44,230
ok let's talk about nature darvon and
bounty hunting first how many bug bounty

4
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,309
hunter so here in this room please raise
your hands

5
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:54,190
nobody do you know even what bounties
anybody

6
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:04,420
yeah great audience but what has nature
to do with bug bounty hunting are it

7
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,420
turns out that nature is actually crew
you have one animal feeding another and

8
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,910
if you don't believe me try to swim in
the water near bahamas and you will see

9
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,300
the renters of boom

10
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:25,030
so on the other side nature is also
beautiful and we can learn much of it

11
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:34,810
are for example hunting techniques and
as the name implies bounty-hunting are

12
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:49,120
hunting is part of bonding so Who am I
not a stranger at all 2014 are presented

13
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,820
with million gobble me on this is here

14
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:58,339
raise your hand yeah I've seen a tool
for reversing concrete application and

15
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:10,970
and basically we showed you how to cheat
in mobile mobile games the next year

16
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:19,129
milan presented ecstatic for hackers how
to analyze by five packets and if you

17
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:26,599
don't know Alex stands for elasticsearch
lock station Qabbani boom we also run

18
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:31,578
the CTF here antibody playing CTF last
year

19
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:40,370
ok how is this year going not so well
it's interesting

20
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:48,620
ok so boo now it's 2016 and I'm back

21
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:56,120
oh hi everybody here's my list of boxes
is discovered

22
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:03,530
so r if you can see from the timeline
here i was very active room for one

23
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:10,549
mount are the main reason for this is my
motivation behind it because I'm a

24
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:17,000
security consultant at various and I do
a lot of panties think security

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,370
assessment everything you can imagine
about security and I just wanted to

26
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,319
prove to myself that I'm good at this
why because bug bounty hunting as a

27
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:32,268
quite competitive if you have a lot of
bug bounty hunters with a lot of

28
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:39,200
knowledge and so on so this is my
timeline of discovered box i'll try to

29
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,700
explain this box through the
presentation and try to give you some

30
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,569
basic information how to start bug
bounty hunting

31
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:55,429
why shoot why shouldn't and what you
should do so we will try to answer those

32
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:04,910
basic questions and the but the
Pandora's Box is of course how how to do

33
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,510
our bounty hunter

34
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:15,149
how to be effective how to be famous all
to earn money do it for a living so why

35
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,389
bounty-hunting some do it for money

36
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:25,979
some dude for fame but of course if you
have a lot of money bug bounty hunting

37
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:33,690
this is like you have a lot of fame are
the others do it because they want to

38
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:39,300
learn something you my advice to you is
do it for fun because if you do it for

39
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:46,860
farm all things will naturally follow so
you will learn a lot you will have money

40
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:54,120
and you have thing and why do it because
even kids can do it this is an article

41
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:03,750
about the 10-year ball he found the
Bakken Instagram and got 10,000 for it

42
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:10,500
so basically for ten-year-old kids can
do you can also do it but it's kind of

43
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,410
depressing if you're hacking let's say
48 hours and then you read such an

44
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:23,460
article please don't give up maybe he
got lucky maybe he's a genius and don't

45
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:30,960
don't compare yourself to others and
evenly if you think positively are you

46
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,830
can pick a strategy other waste you have
ten children's turned it into a bug

47
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:44,580
bounty hunters and you got a living so
even but i don't know i don't have

48
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,639
children are they say the children never
listen so maybe you have chances that

49
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,550
two out of ten will be bug bounty
hunters

50
00:05:53,550 --> 00:06:03,810
so good luck with the rest 8y not bone
team a lack of time of course this was

51
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:09,090
my let's say factor why I

52
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:19,150
didn't do but wanting more but our it's
up to you actually it's not because I

53
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:25,780
didn't have time but because I was not
willing to spend a lot of time or it can

54
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,460
be on healthy

55
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,919
it depends and can it can be stressful i
don't know for me it wasn't but I put it

56
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:42,070
on the slide because it's a fancy and
popular work these days are so who who

57
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,300
are the hunters

58
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:52,240
if you start bug bounty are you just
face it never be a thousand people with

59
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,690
more knowledge than you probably they
have more time than you and some are

60
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:05,169
like you so you will feel like this
little guy here if you start and

61
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:15,159
competing against dose but as I said
don't compare yourself to others try to

62
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,310
learn something you and things will
naturally follow and who's the hunted

63
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:30,250
basically those are big medium small
companies with bigamy in corporations

64
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:39,190
like Google Facebook Twitter Yahoo you
name it and also the others are Pentagon

65
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:46,060
joined the bug bounty program it's got a
fitness indent on government starts to

66
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:52,150
run a program and maybe not interested
encouraging for the bounty community

67
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:59,349
because this mean that at bones were
doing something good when it comes in

68
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:06,159
terms of security team and also some
exciting companies like Boeing hop

69
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,090
anybody try to hang on Hart here

70
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,210
No

71
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,210
oh sorry

72
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:21,270
actually I was really interested in
hacking this but I didn't know how to

73
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:26,698
explain this to my girlfriend because
you know imagine honey what are you

74
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,000
doing oh I'm trying to find SQL
injection

75
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:40,079
no it's like that i see so I but other
did it and find some awesome box-like

76
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,330
remote code execution and stuff like
this and you can see the variety of

77
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:53,279
companies that are doing bug bounty is
quite are let's say our a positive i

78
00:08:53,279 --> 00:09:00,000
think here and bug bounty business and
help a company tries to run the program

79
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,370
this picture was taken in mesa before
the sad events i was there when the

80
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:16,110
street and this was a shop owner and
this was here if he escapes your

81
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:24,029
registry and he was running for a talent
and put this dock on the side so you can

82
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:31,589
do or let's say around the program like
this it's rather optimistic but I

83
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:37,410
recommend that you do first security
assessment you do a fantasy and then you

84
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,600
go into a bounty hunting home and if you
know if you know the difference between

85
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,450
security assessment can test

86
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:53,040
no one yeah of course you know basically
security assessment was like this you

87
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,560
try to cover the whole area try to find
the vulnerabilities and you end up with

88
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,500
the proof-of-concept are implant as you
should like this you try to exploit as

89
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:11,100
far as you can Our and of course social
engineering case also included bug

90
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:21,360
bounty is not different in terms are
like for like for example are if you are

91
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,240
companies running a program and are they
are actually glad to discover something

92
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:34,620
and are they are not glad if you try to
exploit them so much so he showed them a

93
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,839
proof-of-concept and that's it for
example if F remote code execution you

94
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,600
just output data comment

95
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,089
or who am i and show them that it's
possible and I not try to have the

96
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:54,569
server and get their emails and so on so
and this sounds bounty is not so

97
00:10:54,569 --> 00:11:02,219
different from security assessment but
it's different in terms of resources and

98
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,899
bug bounty you have unlimited people
that are trying to track you you have

99
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:13,740
unlimited time and if you try to run the
program you should first do a security

100
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,000
assessment from inside then from the
outside then you should do a ban test

101
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,819
and eventually after sometime about
wanting program now that we know why do

102
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,189
it and who does it

103
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,190
let's talk about how to do it

104
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:38,639
the first thing is knowledge if you have
a decent amount of knowledge you should

105
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:45,810
go but if you don't you should acquire
knowledge then you can reduce their at

106
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:52,138
Hector one or back route for example our
platforms for bounty hunters anybody

107
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:55,949
know Hector 1k background

108
00:11:55,949 --> 00:12:05,189
ok arm i started to take everyone down I
release it that back road but then

109
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:13,740
eventually my time went off we will talk
also about strategy if you choose the

110
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,529
strategy then you should just your
program and go for it but remember our

111
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:22,529
to learn and evolve constantly

112
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:33,970
so it's not so easy i found out read
that background forum are they recommend

113
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:40,390
you how to start a bounding understand
start hunting box and the first thing

114
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:48,610
they recommend is to start reading this
is the step where you need to acquire

115
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,050
knowledge of course i would recommend
this resources also to all panting

116
00:12:53,050 --> 00:13:00,459
security assessment because those books
are are great and every compare

117
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:07,870
ourselves our bounty hunters with human
evolution then this face is like a

118
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,760
monkey so if you start bounty-hunting no
offense

119
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:22,689
we all did it we were monkeys and this
was a selfie beeping okay they at

120
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,910
background forum recommend a lot of
steps and before you start it's up to

121
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,240
you i mean if you have an awful lot of
knowledge you should started right away

122
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:38,320
I don't just advise you because I did it
and it's some mistakes so if you are

123
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:46,900
again comparing bounty with evolution
you can see first you are a monkey then

124
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:53,290
you try to stand up then you got some
tools and know how to use them then you

125
00:13:53,290 --> 00:14:00,189
develop even more techniques and
sophisticated tools at at the end you

126
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:06,730
find yourself sitting in front of a
computer for 16 hours a day and now this

127
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,770
is not how you planned

128
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:18,730
you will marry a princess and live happy
ever after but let's face it anytime in

129
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,710
order to be successful in bug bounty
business and of course evolution

130
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:30,100
learning learning learning so my
mistakes are

131
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:37,480
let's say i had a decent amount of
knowledge and just run into a program i

132
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,610
reduce that Hector one and try to help
you but and after a while I didn't even

133
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:50,140
read the rules for river i just said ok
the scope is everything I can hack and I

134
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:56,290
did it after hacking for let's say eight
dollars i didn't find anything I was

135
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,150
little bit disappointed

136
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:06,069
except this mineral block its content
injection basically you can put message

137
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,120
into it

138
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,050
this message said you should call
something can be used for social

139
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:17,020
engineering and fishing and stuff like
this but the program rules stated that

140
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,010
this is out of scope and it's not the
leader before booking outbound him but I

141
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:26,560
didn't read the program also i submit it
directly and and also try to name it

142
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,420
some fancy like arbitrary text inclusion
of course they rejected my report and

143
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:38,319
also lowered my reputation level because
of her 14 I was successful blog that you

144
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:45,430
submit you increase your reputation and
this was much for submission I and i got

145
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:53,530
totally rejected and are but I didn't
lose hope that I discovered another book

146
00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:01,720
let's say I i read the blog close about
boot for simplification attack anybody

147
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,790
no brute force

148
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:10,390
okay for those the . don't know it's
affecting wordpress and basically what

149
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:15,160
you can do as are sent a combination of
thousand username and password for

150
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,500
example to the server and the server
replies for all the combinations if a

151
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:29,500
combination is valid or not so you can
imagine that you can our run your

152
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,820
worthless pretty fast because as you
know if you try to root for something on

153
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:39,130
the map you have some delay and I
reported to them this

154
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,180
durability they said it's an issue about
basically they had some other

155
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:51,930
protections so after a few requests they
shot it down and didn't say how they did

156
00:16:51,930 --> 00:17:00,780
but I almost got reward for this book
which was encouraging but after spend

157
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:07,260
some time I tried to think of it how to
do bounty because as you can see i was

158
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:16,079
not effective so I try to find a
strategy and try to employ a strategy

159
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:22,679
three factors only focus i consider it
as discovery skills what you did it

160
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:30,090
how much time you're willing to spend
and how much time you have

161
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:36,149
and what's your automation want to do it
for fun for money for fame

162
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:43,260
it's up to you i did it for proof of a
point that I'm good at my job so it's up

163
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,010
to you

164
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:50,520
so this was my why I'm good at web and
mobile my weakness was time not because

165
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,230
I didn't have it because I wasn't
willing to spend a lot of time sitting

166
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,050
in front of a computer

167
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:03,510
ok the other thing is learning in
challenge for me for example hacking

168
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,540
it's like four others crossword puzzles

169
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:17,280
it's it's a mentally challenged and as I
said I just want to prove it because I

170
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,950
was good at that

171
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:25,020
what's important here is to discover

172
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:34,429
let's say host if you want to do a bug
bounty against the program and they say

173
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:39,230
for example yahoo.com every sub domain
is allowed then you need to find

174
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:44,000
subdomains then you need to find
interesting holds and if you find an

175
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,370
interesting coast you try to find hidden
content and functionality that shouldn't

176
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:55,340
be there maybe or is doing something
else they didn't foresee after that you

177
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:04,790
analyze the things you scan it your +
and so on so i used here are some of the

178
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:11,570
resource let's say tools and resources
that i use of course burp i prefer

179
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:18,169
boulders up how many of you are using
Zapotec proxy verb

180
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:27,350
oh it's it's 5050 of course kali linux
distribution into Nessus the free

181
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,990
version the first there buster

182
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:37,280
of course also are rooted phone if you
want to run and see what the implication

183
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,170
on the phone does you should have a
rooted phone the other resources which

184
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:46,370
are kind of great for discovery and
forcing more seconds and give get up

185
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:54,500
available that you can have dns names
are directories bailouts and so on and

186
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:04,610
also fuzzyby the other hot topic is
polyglots anybody know what polyglot

187
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,610
this one

188
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:17,309
23 ok our polyglot it's a payload that
executes and different context for

189
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:22,889
example if you take this excess
according to the altar shoots fire on

190
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:28,590
single quote tech attribute double boat
deck attribute and even with all the

191
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:34,590
cattles what this means is actually you
sent one pedal to the server and it

192
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:42,000
covers all the different context so you
are shrinking the traffic between the

193
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,020
server in order to find a vulnerability
ever the scanners and fathers and other

194
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:54,120
tools didn't pick it up they will soon
because it's a hot topic are also asked

195
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:00,840
injection can be covered or four
different times and I think we should

196
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:08,699
follow this area because it it's an
interesting topic are set so about

197
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:15,720
subdomains and bug bounty but one think
our sub domains is very hot topic dunno

198
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:22,350
passive DNS there of course you know
because I would not talk to the right

199
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:30,389
audience if you didn't know basically
they are the store carries anonymously

200
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:39,240
about clients request and those are the
bases are pretty useful for malware

201
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:48,210
analysis and at Western salt is also
useful for bug bounty hunters course are

202
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:55,080
for example of us total has a database
if you run the main search you can find

203
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,178
subdomains interesting

204
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:04,650
Dennis Dennis dumpster for example has
our service to uncover subdomains and

205
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,360
other things you can do in discovering
sound amazing is brute forcing about you

206
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,610
need to have a valid least an algorithm
for example best bounty hunters have

207
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:14,929
there

208
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:22,070
own algorithm for discovering subdomains
and they used to like frickin ng anna

209
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:28,340
malle animal is basically our paper that
was written around recommend you but

210
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:34,340
Jason headaches was the number one at
back Krauts for some time I don't know

211
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:43,490
if we still the number one I use DNS
recon and i use some let's say I have my

212
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:49,040
own list of subdomains of course this
should be also included in strategy

213
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:58,730
the next thing our was doing to ease
myself and bug bounty hunting and to

214
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:05,390
make it easier for me was to write a
Python script for example for

215
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:12,800
discovering submarines are I'm not fan
of 100 lines to present at a conference

216
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:20,750
because it's a little bit shady about
it's quite easy and effective so the one

217
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:25,430
thing here to know is Marcus
elasticsearch the opposition cabana and

218
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:30,830
you barely can put anything into it so i
decided to put subdomains into it what

219
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:36,860
this group does is it takes the word
list and discover sub-domain then it

220
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:45,320
doesn't and maps can on this ports which
are the most often ports used for

221
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:53,330
applications and if it's fine to service
then it puts an interesting search and

222
00:23:53,330 --> 00:24:00,169
of course then you can visualize this
submarines this is some output in urbana

223
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:07,190
for example you can see the sub domain
you can see the title extracted support

224
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,030
this open and so on so you can imagine
you just run the streets around for

225
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:17,270
coffee and come back and see all the
interesting host this can make your life

226
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,350
let's say pretty easier

227
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:31,980
and this tactic paid off i discovered
are reflected success and you begin

228
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,740
networks i found a house which look
interesting and this success was from a

229
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:44,640
textbook like it took me one minute to
exploit it and because i right are a lot

230
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,970
of reports i just submitted a report and
the whole thing took let's say for 15

231
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:59,250
minutes and they paid me 300 box i think
not much but for 15 minutes of work

232
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,400
not bad at all that asset you need to
run the store something discover

233
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:13,590
subdomains and if you have everything
setup then it becomes easier so let's

234
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,990
talk about how to choose a target

235
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:24,540
this is a nice picture of birthdays are
predicting hunting and if you imagine

236
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:30,899
this is for example are large company
running care for example Joe yahoo.com

237
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:36,720
and those are all valid host and how how
can one know which hosting is

238
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:45,390
interesting how to pick a target so my
strategy strategy was for example you

239
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:50,670
discover some similarities between
technology they use architectural and

240
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:56,280
for example if they use for the public
websites about your PHP to Paul as CMS

241
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:04,649
framework and they do it because because
it's actually easier to maintain to

242
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:12,930
update and so on but then after you're
scanning and discover all of those holes

243
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:18,480
running the same software-defined dunno
GS server so probably this should be a

244
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,720
target because they have like not so
much experience

245
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:32,640
and attacking those holes I mean not
attacking protecting those holes so I

246
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:41,669
guess we are we are choosing called
runners which different technology

247
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:50,490
dollar think our what-what are all
Turner's is are basically shortcuts if

248
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:55,200
you do a lot of pentesting can security
assessment you will find yourself

249
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,799
thinking like a developer and for
example of you will choose functionality

250
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:08,908
that was added after it's not the main
branches it was added like like a

251
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:17,640
shortcut so with if you're talking about
one application this is another thing to

252
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:24,299
consider as focus not on the main branch
and of course different technology also

253
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:29,879
the other thing is if application is
running on a different portion 80 or 443

254
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:36,330
this should be maybe your target so
think of it and for me it's paid out

255
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:44,639
because i find on excess and flickr and
about using flickr no one

256
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:56,250
it's it's I think yahoo about Flickr and
it's a large platform for sharing

257
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:06,900
content so this success was by uploading
come icon for your for your avatar and M

258
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:13,200
basically what they did is if you were
uploading the icon day transfer it to

259
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:21,059
also server farm and they included the
worl directly into JavaScript they

260
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:30,149
encoded everything every except 11
singles I single quote and if you

261
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:37,470
induced on your quote like here I hope
you can see it you you could basically

262
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:48,330
write JavaScript discs this was
discovered also really fast and they

263
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:53,100
wanted me I think 300 bucks or something
like this

264
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:59,610
not much but it was very satisfying
because you will probably guess that a

265
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,510
lot of bug bounty hunters have been
looking into this and they didn't find

266
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:13,799
it and this is this was satisfying for
me let's talk about another thing mobile

267
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:23,429
anybody are let's say how many of you
use android iphone

268
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:36,339
no iphone only 1i also use Android and
if you do bug bounty hunting most of the

269
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:43,809
companies are developing stuff for both
platforms and they unify things not the

270
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:50,469
client part the server part and I choose
for example android because I most more

271
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:56,709
family with it and the other thing i
like to choose in mobile application is

272
00:29:56,709 --> 00:30:00,639
the is the communication with the server

273
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:08,139
ok the client side is also interesting
because how they store information so on

274
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:13,839
but i'm more interested in there up
because already

275
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:22,208
I mean they often place SL pinning and
then they think they are secure because

276
00:30:22,209 --> 00:30:29,859
ok ifs opening know you can you don't
know what's the right request to the

277
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:37,178
server and you cannot exploit me and
they don't check the payload so this is

278
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:45,099
the biggest mistake they are making do
you know SS opening okay

279
00:30:48,290 --> 00:31:00,409
so if we talk about Android you can
bypass developing using the framework

280
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:07,460
rack series of thread which is basically
for also for iOS and exposed and this is

281
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:15,170
the easy way you download a model and
and with one click you should be fine

282
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:21,680
and see the request between the
application and the server but sometimes

283
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:29,750
it doesn't work and basically and what
they do is hooking the get Ross manager

284
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:38,960
methods and instructing the application
to or let's say the RPO 502 trust all

285
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,270
the certificates so you can place your
for example if you use burp and be

286
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:50,300
man-in-the-middle and see all the
requests so using a framework is the

287
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:56,870
easy way to do it the hard ways
modifying the application i'm talking

288
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:04,100
again about Android and i found the two
things what you can do here as replacing

289
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,320
the keystore and of course you need to
do the reverse engineering you need to

290
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:15,110
discover the password for the keystore
and extract application replace the

291
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:21,800
keystore inside the key social your
birth certificate and you're good to go

292
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:28,730
of course you can do also modify the
code but this means in and read that you

293
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:36,110
need to read smaller cult which is not
so fancy at all and if you replace the

294
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:40,429
cold you pack it and sign it and you are
good to go

295
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:47,510
these are this is the hard way because i
found out that for example this

296
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,080
application that analyze the developers
that are

297
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:58,309
developing let's say regular application
are going can't handle an hour because

298
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:06,980
they try to protect their under
application and what do you think is

299
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,980
this an clue

300
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:19,899
no clue at all just shoot it

301
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:32,809
this is a basic four encoded white
stream of a keystore and this was

302
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:40,190
directly and java source code so i
didn't know which part they use if they

303
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:47,269
use the key sore on the package or they
use this key store so i replace both of

304
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:48,019
them

305
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:57,110
this is how i did it i just created a
keystore place burp certificate into it

306
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:04,908
and also added the reverse engineering
part and our i discovered the password

307
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:13,190
are the then the next step is to write
some java code and transform this key

308
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:20,240
store and to base64 encoded by stream
and place it into this part of Colton

309
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,638
you're good to go

310
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:30,919
it's kind of hard to do these things and
I did it almost 41 weekend that I

311
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:37,940
discovered reverse-engineered and what's
going on and after that I was successful

312
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:44,059
i saw the request and I quit because i
was so satisfied to see the request i

313
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:54,679
didn't even test happy anymore but this
was a mistake of course the next thing I

314
00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:05,150
like to talk about as don't give up this
are my failures because sometimes our if

315
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:09,140
you if you're doing bug bounty you're
running into some

316
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:16,680
let's say unpredictable situations i
reported to your beauty networks the

317
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:24,779
jungle pockets enabled luckily for them
it was some newer version so of the the

318
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:33,960
error produce some stuck here on the
arrow showed some information about what

319
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:41,490
models are used which usernames there
are and so on but they're actually said

320
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,439
to me what's the problem

321
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:52,319
so I said okay a lot of information is
real you cannot exploit directly so that

322
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:59,009
they said our ok it's not eligible for
bounty I didn't know even i think they

323
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,130
fix it but no thanks no not at all

324
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:07,470
so maybe sometimes you will run into
this kind of situation the other time

325
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:14,490
you will run into see with the situation
like if you are reporting a duplicate I

326
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:21,569
found on success in a survey at ubiquiti
networks and it turns out it wasn't

327
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:30,240
implicate so they say thank you but I
already 11 bounty hunter and reported it

328
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,379
already

329
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:41,520
the other things is you will miss stuff
a lot actually hear a bounty hunter i

330
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:48,059
think it was orange nickname discovered
of template injection anybody know this

331
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:51,960
vulnerability only one

332
00:36:51,960 --> 00:37:01,500
ok it's about basically with template
ejection you can run remote called and

333
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:09,660
this reliability was present in the
profile of uber i was checking the uber

334
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:15,118
and i thought this may be interesting
but it turned out that

335
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:21,620
request that you try to change in your
profile they sent you an email and I was

336
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:27,350
not willing to run the tool scanner into
it because i would get easily thousand

337
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:33,740
and more emails but if I did I would
discover this because most cameras are

338
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:42,109
having those payloads already inside are
so basically here is the lesson that you

339
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:46,580
need to our need to have updated
scanners

340
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:53,060
the other thing is don't give up because
you were missed of actually a lot

341
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:58,160
because you will have some sub site and
then you discover how conniving is that

342
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,620
but you did and the other thing is you
will find something what others didn't

343
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:20,600
which is that's a pretty satisfying so
let's talk about statistics if I if I

344
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:26,660
spent I was doing bug bounty for one
mount or maybe more spent 30 hours

345
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:36,259
basically it was 60 because I I trying
to push my ego a little bit i got six on

346
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,250
the box for it

347
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:45,710
this is twenty dollars an hour which is
not bad at all but of course you have

348
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:53,330
the uncertainty that you find that you
will find something it's like running a

349
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,259
business

350
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:00,080
sometimes you have projects sometimes
you don't but as they say no risk no

351
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:07,940
phone and other things is I found report
about the state of bounty at back route

352
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:16,760
and that they said that top-10 hunters
are basically getting twenty-three

353
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:23,510
percent of total payout this means that
I think 2016 they paid out two million

354
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,020
dollars and

355
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:33,000
this God divided two top-10 bug bounty
hunters and the rest just got everything

356
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:43,260
was left so if you consider doing a bug
bounty for a living

357
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:53,130
be good at it my advice is to use keep
your jobs and do it for fun and try to

358
00:39:53,130 --> 00:40:01,530
learn something new i put some resources
here up as I said with a store for

359
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:07,320
example to discovering subdomains also
the NM at ens dumpster

360
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:16,259
here's a blog post about how to get
started into bug bounty and some

361
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:24,690
resources and guitar pop basically a
list of payload and stuff like that so i

362
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:33,300
hope you consider after this
presentation doing some bug bounty and

363
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:41,160
what I forgot to set is when I'm stuck
at bondi always watch our talk about

364
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,230
bounty at YouTube my inspiration was
Jason headaches i started after

365
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:56,280
listening to his talk and you should I
think you should also look at some

366
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,580
videos read proof of concepts and of
course you first need to acquire

367
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:08,759
knowledge and don't make the mistake
that decided not to read the program

368
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,790
rules and so on so this is basically
this what I'm trying to say here

369
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:24,900
so questions yes you should come to the
Michael

370
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,250
yeah

371
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:55,400
I have a question if you join forces
with other researchers for bounty is it

372
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:04,160
able to be in that 23% in those 10 if
it's able yeah of course

373
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,160
so you want to join forces

374
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,780
this is an offer yeah of course I want
to join forces

375
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:18,319
okay great so when I can't horses and
get those 1 million euros see ya

376
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:32,420
I think it's enough if 500,000 ok think
another question i'll come on on ok

377
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,420
sorry that next

378
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:42,859
ok up does the black market place more
than 40 of bugs

379
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:49,130
I don't have experience in the black
market but i guess it does

380
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:55,280
sure you don't just get that is another
question

381
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:00,790
and

382
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:05,879
hello is all congratulation for the
presentation

383
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:11,189
thank you I congratulation for the
presentation I would like to ask you if

384
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:18,120
the companies that are at doing the
bounty programs are a and exploding the

385
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,470
fact that

386
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:26,040
the halfback panting program so did note
and actually give so many money to the

387
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:31,770
actual security and penetration testing
and all this stuff and you answered the

388
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:38,550
question yet i said i recommend two
companies to do first the security

389
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:43,950
assessment and stuff like this but as
you know security assessments are always

390
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:47,549
limited with time and also resources

391
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:52,259
some people are working and in a back
problem the program they are don't but

392
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:56,340
if you run straight into a bug bounty
program you need to have a lot of money

393
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:01,560
are but of course there are also
programs that don't give away manages

394
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:07,259
thank you and for example that if you
look at backroad you have a lot of

395
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,530
programs do it just for thank you

396
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:18,420
so here is the basic concepts is for fun
and to and Kane hands the security of

397
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:22,500
companies i didn't know if i ask myself
the question

398
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,280
ok and other questions

399
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:32,530
ok

400
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:41,570
hello what happens if you really break
something you you said you had a

401
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:46,820
experience with the going against the
rules or something and we have legal

402
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:54,200
applications and they're there they're
not so strict it because this guy orange

403
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,750
that discovered this bark already
published the blogpost and they didn't

404
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:05,000
even fix it so he removed the blog post
after that and they said okay it's okay

405
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,170
but the defense i think the highest
Bondy was paid

406
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,540
I don't know actually the story about it
but the highest quality was paid because

407
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:25,279
some hacker was actually not showing
just proof of concept but taking over a

408
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:32,630
large part of the network so it depends
on bug bounty as always independence and

409
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:39,080
security or walking on the grey line and
if you step a little left your on the

410
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,790
black side if you step on the right here
on the light so it's always depends

411
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:47,000
thank you

412
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:56,690
other questions if he has no questions
you can catch me up I will be here today

413
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:10,910
and tomorrow so we can talk about bone
to maybe join some forces so thank you
