1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:26,650
our next rockies by hedi and it's called
how not surround a hackerspace enjoy

2
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:32,920
well good morning everyone

3
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,749
so that's my awesome talk about how to
run a hex pace with my really bad slides

4
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:40,539
I didn't have time to make it fancy so
enjoy

5
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:45,579
I'm so first of all how to attract space
there is a really good picture about it

6
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:52,390
so that's like normal with our heck
space so it's some Germans it stays so

7
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,879
so what they do admit Vienna should be
forbidden so much like four years ago

8
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:00,068
they had really a lot of fun

9
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:07,090
no one died so it's everything ok so
first of all what is this all about

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,000
yeah thanks first of all what the heck
space maybe look everyone here knows

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,320
what the heck spaces so there are a lot
of space around the globe

12
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,410
Aaron most of the countries and are also
getting more and more hex bases in the

13
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,850
world

14
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,360
first of all it's like it's what
infrastructure to have a space where you

15
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,820
can share infrastructure have a
community to share knowledge it's also

16
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:40,449
about hosting user groups and have a lot
of people there and sharing knowledge

17
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:46,000
for new projects and one of the most
important things about interesting

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,430
projects so people going together make
some interesting projects i will try

19
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:56,950
later some cool pictures about some
projects we had made our I want to make

20
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:03,250
the lab yeah that's like the best
picture to show what the middle of is it

21
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:11,080
it's a phone booth it's it's like TARDIS
just mother so it's all the full . so i

22
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,910
think it was off after the camp event we
just put everything later formed when it

23
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,660
came back from

24
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:23,590
a complication camp so that's our logo
we have a form of its fully working with

25
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,360
ry phone in it so if you collect the
Metalab you will just bring their inside

26
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,140
and you can go there and hang up and
talk with the people you can even call

27
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,179
out from from the form of some other
people if you like and it also has a

28
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,970
cool feature it's called on selfie booth
self-report so you go in there is a

29
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,410
webcam there is a big button and if you
press the button makes her selfie and

30
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:54,010
uploaded yourself soup so soup is a
micro blog like tumblr it's our it began

31
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:59,079
at made the lab for people from a clip
made this platform and there we have our

32
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,360
thumb or soup lock and there's our
self-report soup I control later

33
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:11,230
episodes are quite some funny pictures
so made love itself it's ry nice heck

34
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,600
space we have around $MONEY hundred
eighty members so it's quiet quite some

35
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:23,410
number this year it what it became 10
years old so it's quite a long time so

36
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,959
it's there for us our motivation for
other headspace is free which became a

37
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,390
new in other countries it was like a
motivation and it's also one of the

38
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:40,839
famous x paces in in the world because
it's so old we have quite a quite a

39
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,570
pickaxe pay so there is a plan of the X
pace it's like 220 square meters around

40
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:56,920
and there's really a lot of rooms there
on small here for you here arm we have

41
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,640
like a main room they are very all the
people are working on stuff and we have

42
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,529
two big presentations with the library
with some books which are like deadwood

43
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:11,590
so it's during the shelf and rallies on
one reads books there but they are there

44
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,200
so that's the library we have a cool
pretty stuff room area for this cameras

45
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,409
and lays a large 3d printers and laser
scanner with our kitchen so you can even

46
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,470
cook at the myth that make some

47
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,290
illegal stuff like chocolate coffee and
it was like last last year people came

48
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:37,080
there put the make made chocolate all of
our coffin to put a lot of caffeine in

49
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,530
it no one died but it was really good

50
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,330
we also have whatever left with like are
working space we have there are

51
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,789
soldering stations with the laser cutter
with a video cutters or you can make

52
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:58,170
some funny videos to put on your laptop
on other cars and so on therefore dark

53
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,850
rumor can make the photo lab can make
pictures and all the old school stuff

54
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,820
there are some people which also make
their own cameras

55
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:11,340
I'll ultralight with some pictures out
of it and if the heavy machinery

56
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,640
I'm really glad that that till now no
one died there

57
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,790
I mean there yet there's really really
some danger stuff some sometimes there

58
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,470
that you really think holy sheets that
no one thought there so we have there

59
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:32,610
are cnc machine and a lot of heavy
machinery stuff like well welding

60
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:39,450
equipment cnc machine a drills or
everything you need to kill yourself

61
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:44,039
so I'm really glad the real nothing
happens to now because it's also a big

62
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,900
problem for us for the board members if
really something dangerous happens we

63
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,169
have like the liability and have been
problems for this

64
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:01,169
well we like 10 years have made the lab
and i will present you some solutions

65
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:09,690
for common problems in X basis what we
had like I will start with my story of

66
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:19,020
how I became a board member of Metalab
so it looks like a deaf paper so it's a

67
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,270
little bit like this so becoming a board
member of matlab a recap so it was like

68
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:31,530
last year or end of july well before
Election are we just need to fill out

69
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,520
three formulas for progressive stuff but
cool yeah look I will

70
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,340
go there for election and they will
elect me for board member and well I

71
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,960
just became the board member i got
elected for this and then just this

72
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:57,400
happened after election so I i started
to board member and start to do to check

73
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,080
out or our membership stuff like how
many members you have and whether open

74
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,258
membership fees what people have depth
there and well for the formulas for the

75
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,819
broadcast the stuff we just needed to
put their how many member open

76
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:18,819
membership fees we have so I I said down
and checked out how many open membership

77
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:25,539
fees where there and it was like between
10 and 20 k euros of membership fees

78
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:30,580
because people are that was like a
shitload of work because people didn't

79
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:36,008
do it properly like over all the years
people became board members and made

80
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:41,139
their stuff but they didn't make more
than they needed so it really became a

81
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:49,780
big load of problems so that was quite a
lot of work so it was around 16,000

82
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:56,020
heroes and open membership fees are
after one year I managed to get half of

83
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,370
it so i get a got from the people at
talking euros back of the open

84
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,599
membership fees it wasn't really a lot
of work especially if you like call

85
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:09,340
people and tell them hey there you have
like 1000 euro open fields you want to

86
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:16,150
pay back it was all in all I really
match to like talk to people and tell

87
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:23,799
well come on pay like 300 euros and the
rest will just let it fall down so we

88
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,710
tried to get the solution for everyone
that they can pay some stuff for we will

89
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,370
call the well you have no peace anymore
but now you're just paying member and

90
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:40,270
pay all the fees no regular so it was
like a couple of many ways so sometimes

91
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:44,500
people just forgot to pay sometimes it
was like a mistake of the board members

92
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,050
they just deactivated there

93
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:53,050
the bank account input from the people
and they didn't know that so after like

94
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,189
fears he didn't get the bank account
money from the people and then we just

95
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,730
started

96
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,750
oh well it was deactivated like four
years ago and no one knows why and

97
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,720
people also didn't know that so it was
quite out a lot of work and but it

98
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:14,140
really get really was and there at the
end of success because I get like half

99
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:20,829
of the stuff back of the money day had
open fees so really are really important

100
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:27,130
thing is check out regular finance stuff
in your bills so if you don't do it you

101
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:35,079
end up there for big pile of open fees
or missing money and its really are

102
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:40,329
it's really bad if like have open fields
and you have to pay stuff and you and

103
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,890
then don't have the money to pay you can
really close your space so really dry

104
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:49,899
have tried to have solid income to pay
your running costs that's a big problem

105
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:52,779
if you don't have to do it you don't
have the money every month to pay

106
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:56,709
running costs you can close in the next
month and all the people will have no

107
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:02,199
space there to cook too cool stuff so
the first thing if you like make X peso

108
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,470
have a running xbase check out to have
your running costs every month can pay

109
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:15,399
like the rent the gas electricity we had
to make it look like I have like around

110
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:21,190
3,000 euros running costs $MONEY per
month for it on fire for 500 it's not

111
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:27,279
it's really a lot of fees to pay we only
pay for electricity every month 400

112
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,529
euros so it's quite a lot of money for
electricity we pay like $MONEY for the

113
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:39,370
rent two tours of euros a month and so
you really have to have the running

114
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:44,829
costs there else you can really close
really fast and that's really a lost for

115
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:50,380
the whole community if there is X base
closed if you have enough money then you

116
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,380
have stuff like this so

117
00:10:53,910 --> 00:11:01,439
that's like a tomato left when we had
the money now it's okay we still have

118
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,700
money but still there is some stuff to
do at the matlab so it's like every time

119
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,370
you have to do stuff

120
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:14,160
well do the work regularly as board
members and this members it's because

121
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,550
it's constant work if you like that
regularly all the stuff and you have

122
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,540
like you need like three hours a week
for doing stuff you have constant work

123
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,140
and you will not get the sheet lot of
pile of stuff and you don't know where

124
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,460
to start

125
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:34,590
like we got it after became board
members and also for this topic is on a

126
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:39,300
very important communicate each other so
communicative with other people

127
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:46,620
communicate if your board members are if
something is not ok tell them because

128
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,430
maybe they don't know it you have a
problem with it or that they don't know

129
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:56,400
that you that they made a mistake so
please tell them and try to get better

130
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,829
so that's the really up a big thing it
don't help if you like right females on

131
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:06,660
the mailing list and tell them you're
all shitloads of people go there to

132
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,439
people who talk face-to-face if the
people and tell them your problems or

133
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,360
solutions and work together you have all
the same you have all one goal you want

134
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,350
to have a cool xbase of interesting
projects and if you just write all the

135
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,970
time ailments or CD everything is the
space will close soon and all people run

136
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,080
away so it's really important to
communicate with each other

137
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,439
communicate more clearly and really
cutting a concert of way else people

138
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:41,370
will just take each other and that's not
the the thing you want to go r1 also

139
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:48,480
important of thing is is rules are rules
are in some way important

140
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:55,800
well there is it's hard to say but the
best thing is life has as less as

141
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:02,760
possible and as much as needed so it you
have to be clear as community how many

142
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,100
rules you want to have how many rules
you need

143
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:12,880
and the bestest GF s athlete was
possible but you have to speak together

144
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:20,769
and and and check out what rules we want
to have what rules we don't need and you

145
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:27,190
need this you need to make this
community so it don't help if you have

146
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,149
like three members which really want all
the rules and the rest of members don't

147
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:31,959
need them

148
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:37,209
it's everything is just overhead if you
like more rules than you need so go

149
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:42,130
together speak with each other and like
get those get the set of of rules you

150
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:47,079
really need for space to run up so
they're like rules you will need like

151
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:56,109
how to all want to do with people which
which were doing problems of what to do

152
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,279
with people with our which are sleeping
that's a big problem at the lab we have

153
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:04,480
like a simple rule you're not allowed to
sleep at the matlab because they were

154
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,670
some people who really abused this went
to the mainland slept like three days in

155
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,930
a row and didn't see a shower for 10
years or more like this

156
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:21,370
so therefore days the rule sleeping is
not allowed to make the lab and they

157
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,939
were really all the kick-out people for
this is always someone

158
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:31,779
Oh sleep to meet the lab he gets warmed
by us and told well you can go home now

159
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:37,720
if they catch the guy or the girl a lot
of time we keep them out like towards

160
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,209
three days so he gets a band from metal
app and that like snakes around so if

161
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:47,859
someone get the first time here gets
like been for one or two weeks and there

162
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,970
are some people actually come there to
meet laps left they're got kicked out

163
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:58,720
first day came back again slept again
got kicked out for two weeks after two

164
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,069
weeks he came again slept there again I
get out of time kicked off for two weeks

165
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,939
so there are some people didn't learn
stuffs and you have you have to execute

166
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:13,269
stuff that's the next slide our rows
upon execution execution is like no rule

167
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:18,069
an important text so you you don't need
rules if you don't enforce them

168
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:19,719
so let's a really

169
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,250
big thing because we have other some
rules which are didn't get and forth

170
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,319
quite real and it's like no rule with an
important text and zero fucks given by

171
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:35,110
the people so if you really make rules
also enforce them and even if it's like

172
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:42,490
not so easy to enforce them like kicking
out people or our other stuff you have

173
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:48,490
to do it else it's like talking for the
community because people then just have

174
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,620
to know fun to come back to the lab to
the community because i think i should

175
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:59,170
get that code Aaron or toxic people here
which are better people and they don't

176
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:05,110
get kicked out so you just our shoot
yourself in your own money if you don't

177
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,110
enforce rules that's really important

178
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:15,459
another really important topic is our
lawyer limits one everyone at the Metro

179
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:21,638
tech space or do it or you ever ever
stuff without getting money so all the

180
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:27,220
board members to all the stuff without
getting paid and also all the projects

181
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,410
are made by the people and they don't
get paid for it so it's like a space

182
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,629
where people just off use their free
time to make cool stuff but you have to

183
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:43,809
know your limits because if you get too
much to work and you were just there

184
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:48,069
will be a time or just say fuck off LOL
come again because i have so much work

185
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:54,490
to do there and I I don't like Monty's
so don't don't let people give you more

186
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,420
work than you really need to do so you
left and lower limits when you have to

187
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:04,899
stop very have to say I I don't have
free or service for this so you have you

188
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,720
have to you have you must have to say no
if you really can't do it because are

189
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,980
there are also other people which
collect it can get do the work for you

190
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,669
just ask our people if they have like
three time or for your suitors to do the

191
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:26,350
work because there was one guy to meet
the lab he like got like eight or ten

192
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:31,719
projects and others that sometimes you
just kick all exploit away and told as

193
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,490
well

194
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:38,370
I will hold on to anything anymore
because I got all the projects and I'm

195
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,659
alone and no one wants to help me so I
keep away all the products and just

196
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,400
didn't do any product anymore and its
really a pity because he had was a good

197
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,410
guy and he know what to do and had also
the ability to make the cool projects

198
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,780
but if you get like 10 projects you
you're not able to every of them because

199
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,790
they've also to work you have to get
money you have other people your friends

200
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,300
to see so really are

201
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,909
don't let give you too much work as you
really can do you know you you need also

202
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:18,030
need for yourself so I yes you see
yourself to say no when I don't help the

203
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,800
people give america i really have to say
no I don't want to do this I can't have

204
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,409
the resources

205
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:30,809
that's our that's really that's really
important topic also if needed and

206
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:35,730
people from the space so if there really
people which are toxic to the community

207
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,980
or making bad things you have to keep
them out else of people will not come

208
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,429
again or new people will come because
they're toxic people are people which

209
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:48,720
are like have a bad behavior and that's
a big problem was intimated that there's

210
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,570
some people which little heart took its
little hard to keep them out but at at

211
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,260
the end you have to do it because other
people will not come again because of

212
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,420
this one person that's a big problem of
new people don't come again if they like

213
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:09,270
see this person action how it behaves
like even if the person is a longtime

214
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:16,290
member that that's no excuse to 44
shitty behavior so even if you're like

215
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:21,300
member 46 year in your space that's not
actually not excuse to like a shitty

216
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:28,649
member and be talking to other people
and destroy stuff and go to other people

217
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:37,410
and make them cry all happened at us our
space so you have really two to do it so

218
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:43,470
go there and keep the person out forever
or for some months or tell the person if

219
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,540
you like

220
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,960
what if you will I can guarantee you can
go to come back there are some person we

221
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,520
really kicked out and told the person
you can go to therapy therapy and if you

222
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,639
if you did that and you show us the that
you did there

223
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,090
you can come back there are some people
who are really paranoid

224
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:04,159
it was one which really paranoid and
thought that it was like on surveillance

225
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,800
by other people and then we get kicked
her out and told their you're not

226
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,330
welcome to lio went to therapy and you
fixed your problem because there was

227
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:21,230
really a person's other people felt very
uncomfortable in the space arm

228
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:29,899
another thing is also are you have to be
you should need you should have like

229
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:35,690
some ruleset what you apply for all the
stuff i don't have contacts life for

230
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:41,930
that but you should like as a community
make a rule set for for for bad behavior

231
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,040
like what we'll do it if some people
make that stuff like will call the

232
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,790
person for one day we'll kick out the
person for seven days and like make a

233
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:58,040
hero here of how bad people's behavior
will will have how bad on execution like

234
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,090
if someone's really really shitty and
heard someone I think the problem should

235
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:09,379
get out of middle forever if it's really
are a hard incident if some people like

236
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:14,930
trolling all other people all the time i
would say you can pick people out for

237
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:18,050
like seven days to weeks

238
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:21,530
it depends entertainment on the
situation so you you should have like a

239
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:27,710
rule set of rules which apply like what
is the what enforced like keep people

240
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:32,030
out for two weeks three weeks then
people for one day you should like agree

241
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:36,860
with the whole group on this and you
have to enforce it also you don't you

242
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,909
don't have to feel like a real set but
you don't force it so that that's that's

243
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,450
the most important thing if you're froze
you have to force it else it won't help

244
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,450
you

245
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:52,789
that's like just my slide my slides for
the how to not run the heck space but i

246
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:57,440
still have some inside of the Metalab of
our cool project what we did there that

247
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,950
you have let's see what is like the
space around and I can tell us some

248
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,950
stories about it

249
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,750
so let's see

250
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:17,840
boom

251
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,580
yeah

252
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,840
so that's one shield our that's what she
loved us

253
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,178
it means of because of cleaning closed
so it's on our foam roof

254
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:40,250
oh that's like our are clean working
table it's really unique cost on a table

255
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,890
full of stop and people are really
pissed off

256
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,890
never seen it like this

257
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:56,299
yeah this disk space intentionally left
blank arm that's a cool project one of

258
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,710
the members that was pretty printed and
there is a LED stripe in it and a half

259
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,039
like kept different colors there they
are

260
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:11,840
RGB LED for map interface I thinking it
the print went for two days for this

261
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:23,389
object that are really nice shovel wreck
so it's really quite structure it's

262
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:32,870
really structured I mean that was much
worse sometimes I our kitchen so that's

263
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,399
the way you don't you get the right a
kitchen is of native method at eleven a

264
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:42,620
really big problem because people really
pissed off because people don't put your

265
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:48,620
stuff away and it was also a lot of
drama on the mailing list so it's really

266
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:55,189
not so good and also people really there
was also fought to shut down the kitchen

267
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:03,080
and you only have excessive modification
to the kitchen with like some ideas down

268
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:10,389
senior and yes we have also one
procedure procedure called shut down and

269
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:18,670
clean up our cleanup is add 2145 that
everyone stands up and bring out the

270
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:24,910
depends the trash bins and sometimes you
have to you have to hit people in the

271
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:29,740
ass to stand up and do that that's all
sometimes a problem and sometimes you

272
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,300
haven't even to keep people to really
don't want to do that because defeat

273
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:40,389
well I'm too good for this and that's
bad but you have to do a stuff and have

274
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:45,430
some enforcement because if if everyone
is sitting there and don't bring out the

275
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:51,820
trash bins no one will do and shutdown
is our procedure we have our key system

276
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:57,580
so i remember can get the key that can
get access 24 hour seven if I button so

277
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,409
key lock system and if you like the last
member and there are some other people

278
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:08,020
journal of members or no key members you
have to keep them out and you have to

279
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:12,129
like close to shut down the space you
have to close the windows closed the

280
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:16,900
doors are shut down the lights and
effective shotgun approach proceedure

281
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:22,780
but that's also a problem because there
are some people which are missed it to

282
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,560
do that and or sometimes people came to
make them in the morning and it was open

283
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:32,290
and no one was there so we have like
little bit too much keys out there and

284
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:36,310
we have to rethink the four key system
because there's some people which are

285
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:41,830
not reliable enough to have a key
because they don't are do their part on

286
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:45,250
properly and we don't have like we don't
trust them anymore some people not

287
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,810
anymore because they don't do the shot
down properly and that's that's all

288
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,700
some of the problems we behalf of the
metal web so it's also a lot of stuff is

289
00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:02,260
about trust because we trust a lot of
the members so but it's every time

290
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:09,730
obtaining there's if people are don't
show the trust and behave other buffet

291
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:14,110
behave bed and then we lose the trust in
some people and really bad because the

292
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,809
whole community is more or less on trust
level

293
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:21,279
like the gift gift the people kyon trust
level it because we trust them that they

294
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:27,129
can do the shutdown and therefore we
know started too far remember workshop

295
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:31,090
the people have to go there to get the
key so they learn how to deliver track

296
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:36,879
down like there are their fire
distinguish out how to shut down the lab

297
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:42,610
what have to be seen also there's all of
big thing to shut down the soldering

298
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:51,519
stations because not good to let them
overnight there and so a community at

299
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,619
the middle of is like everything is
about trust and if you lose the trust

300
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:57,879
you have a problem

301
00:26:57,879 --> 00:27:03,039
so really if you have some members which
are not trustworthy fee it's the

302
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,869
question if there really should be at
the laptop the space if they are not

303
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:12,549
trustworthy because they can have a bet
behavior so you should rethink that

304
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:17,499
about our people which are not trust her
free because there can be our damage for

305
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:23,559
your community that people don't come
again like it told you the way before if

306
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,309
there are people that the ever you
really need to keep them out else meet

307
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:31,090
other people cool project will not come
again and that's that's really bad

308
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:35,259
because if you have fun one person which
really toxic and make problems there

309
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:40,720
will be like 10 minimal 10 other people
have come to the space and I rather will

310
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,409
kick out one person that in our people
who come to the space and make the

311
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:50,619
project even if it's hard you have to do
some something up yeah that's our

312
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:58,029
original xk city with the original
signature from randomer oh so if two of

313
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:03,700
them into at the space are you coming
too bad I can't is important what

314
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,860
someone is wrong or internet or somebody
strong one inmate elapsed or like you

315
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,850
want to see it

316
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:16,509
that's our cool LED stripe we have quite
a lot of leds at the space

317
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:24,360
yes that's like the the important motto

318
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,960
yeah that's one all Member he is not
here anymore estimated lab because of

319
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,650
some problems for other people it's bad
but well it happens so also the result

320
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:42,330
like a natural fluctuation because
people are coming to the middle of

321
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,770
people are going because they got family
so the real every time will be new

322
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:50,879
people there and all people will go
that's just normally but you still have

323
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,840
to and to see that all the new people
are doing something it doesn't help if

324
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,409
they're the new people coming in there
are just looking around and don't give a

325
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,580
fuck about helping out and making cool
stuff

326
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,610
it's also probably mental actuality are
some people that are coming there and

327
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:11,370
just looking around and don't help us
with cleanup and don't two cool projects

328
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:15,209
going to lounge and chill out all the
time and play all the time out of card

329
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:21,270
that's that's not the solution people
that also some actual problem at the lab

330
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:25,680
that people are some people just looking
around and other people can't work

331
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:31,380
because there just are all the day at
the large and playing mario kart and

332
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:39,930
playing ukulele yeah that's the normal
version of the wreck if it's not clean

333
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:45,810
so what one time a year realizing we
just to clean up the whole Lab more or

334
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:56,310
less and people can really make great
the cable make the cables great again we

335
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:02,070
find some interesting Japanese things in
the middle app it in Chinese Chinese

336
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:07,500
things it's really it's really or
interesting what you can find everything

337
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,270
in tomato it's really you just come
there and see some sort of what the fark

338
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:20,790
sometimes like this core infrastructure
factor to not unplug yeah

339
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:29,669
yeah that's like a clean several yeah
it's labeled that that's one important

340
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:35,340
thing label all the stuff at the matlab
else's freefall more or less that's like

341
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:42,238
our clean silver XO people really get
there and made made it great again that

342
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:52,679
like when when they put everything out
of sale rack that's are we headed up the

343
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:57,720
coast under the summer rec so there was
some some of the stuff undersell

344
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:05,700
reconnect pulled it out its like the its
ancient piece of carpet the server rack

345
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,700
it's really it's for sure

346
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:19,200
thousands of euros worth i don't know
what's this looks interesting things you

347
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,499
find up people try to kill themselves
with some rock material and put it maybe

348
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:29,700
in the no electricity stuff i don't know
it looks broken

349
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:44,999
ah diffuse we've also make we are also
doing good food so sometimes people come

350
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:50,220
there and really cook good so there is
also sometimes a community the nerves or

351
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,599
people cook for a committee then we set
down and talk to each other and talk

352
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:58,799
about problems talk about solutions and
just hang out together though it's also

353
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,999
important thing like if you have a
kitchen just to make evening and

354
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:08,879
together and just entertainment and talk
to each other that helps and all the

355
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:19,709
community spiritual will be better so
that's like or-or-or food label

356
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:26,729
so that that's our clean celery it's
like a unique so it's like one time a

357
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:41,460
year select this one week and some some
days some stuff out of the shower XO you

358
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,320
need every time are a hammer hammer time
is important made the left for some

359
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,320
stuff

360
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:57,840
yeah that's our electricity stuff you
that is actually segment of electric

361
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:05,428
directory extension cords we found the
bottom of the right like 20-30 years I

362
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:10,679
object extension cord connected to each
other basic Jake like 12 things together

363
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:17,939
what could possibly go by security
testing electricity hums yeah that's my

364
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:24,450
picture from the what could possibly go
wrong after I action that's all the good

365
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:32,700
it was circuit here though it was seen
among staff and was rolls the walls are

366
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:39,000
you have to try it yourself it's really
look at this

367
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:49,890
I mean community spirit splash splash
fifties so people can best friends which

368
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,540
hated each other two days before the
river

369
00:33:52,540 --> 00:34:02,710
that's all that's the chocolate frosted
chocolate coffee in it

370
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:09,429
chocolate that that was the picture of
its was really awesome white shoulders

371
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:19,418
actually can and not math so yeah I can
order the door expats site i will give

372
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:26,620
it a link later there was a truck that
all dead

373
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:37,750
oh well if x space in Europe a of some
underground and there is water there and

374
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,750
people are dumped while drilling inside
there

375
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:46,929
it happens that that happens so it
really like that it didn't float metal

376
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:52,660
app it was really engineer best practice
don't we don't know from the main water

377
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:59,529
line this is especially optic they're
doing tests drillings for a new

378
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:04,060
underground line and they accidentally
hit the fresh water line with 40

379
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,529
centimeters dilated

380
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:13,810
it's like this yeah it takes places it
on place frightens little under three

381
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,740
level

382
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:22,600
yeah that that that's a cell phone lets
us a camera seems to himself made but no

383
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,040
it's finished one but their picture for
myself but also several hundred

384
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,680
something so whenever the people which
make some cool retro stuff and very fit

385
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:41,200
that are missing wall so we destroyed
our library wall because it was a little

386
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,990
bit falling down and we just rebuilt it
now and just by the LED panels to make

387
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:56,259
it great again so that's like the old
wall with a glass there and LEDs inside

388
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:02,980
but we will replace LED panels to be
like more modern but we will get Gameboy

389
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:12,190
resolution at the mall from the field of
the old glass brick Lincoln wall was

390
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:20,740
signed by five pixels was actually used
to the second screen for a formal 64 you

391
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:29,229
can find that was like to build the
cigarette vending machine which to put

392
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,050
their so like hard work

393
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:37,090
people still didn't got killed there so
don't vary the vending machine is so

394
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:42,299
heavy that for people to different
variants long rules

395
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:49,979
wall and so that's our car door when we
destroyed the the ball and it's standing

396
00:36:49,979 --> 00:36:58,140
layer no one want to build them build a
wall i think so

397
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:06,719
arm that's our big tempt one of our we
have two of them

398
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,739
it's important if you go to camps you
need a really big 10-4 all the people

399
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:13,199
there

400
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:19,319
that's some pretty pretty printed stuff
there at the mental app so if all the

401
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:23,160
people which can print that cool stuff
to repair things that's really important

402
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,439
to know and to have such people

403
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:31,558
so if your broker card they can print
new stuff for the car actually vacuum

404
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:37,289
cleaner they depart while building up
and cleaning up yourself from getting in

405
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:43,289
the door frame so next steps in your
warm all rocks this plug and couldn't

406
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:47,910
find any more one of the members just
like just rebuild there in a few minutes

407
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:55,379
and printed it out . out and fix them so
often are on the on-the-fly fixing so

408
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:02,099
that's our new rebuilt wall it's really
great that that's our fridge and there's

409
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:08,369
all free trip and you wanted more
capacity with more mountain it that's a

410
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,569
wall painting

411
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:18,749
let's take like chilling out that our
alt all free surfaces full old fridge we

412
00:38:18,749 --> 00:38:21,749
have a wallet in the middle at one time

413
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,070
but I'm not like I probably not

414
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:35,500
that's some number i don't know it seems
like the exploit ah so if you need HP

415
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:42,910
explains come to the middle of a white
border to exploit yeah please wait while

416
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:53,618
Wallace rebuilt that wasn't me today

00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:50,890
just txt space edition

478
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:02,920

it's really full of stuff and people
really pissed off and they want to work

483
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:30,400
there is a struggle of vodka

484
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:39,549
you should have their wanted to get your
space but but look at the way for small

485

proprietary stuff

488
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:59,860
yeah still good food there so you should
really make some food even into the

489
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:08,200
local space it's really pushed up the
Kimmy community spirit or

490
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:19,280
if you post on the mental lapse to plug
so you'll find it there so our

491
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,620
electricity so like if you have a lot of

before

495
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,680
sometimes those are some sweet stuff at
the lab but it's really fast of getting

496
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,549
away so you can buy them with our

499
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,000
something crazy

500
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,750
that's a hologram the hologram and if
you test the slings what you have around

501
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:19,280
to make a 3d image of it's just an
artery all that was lying around so we

525
00:50:50,070 --> 00:51:00,240
making yourself at your local headspace
its relative of different people

526
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:06,720
it's not every time the same people

574
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:53,860
i will just go to the kyosho tricky so
if you go on our math lab . 80 you will

575
00:57:54,370 --> 00:58:01,060
oh I don't what nor it worked some time
ago

576
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:11,380
why don't works but actually it should
redirect to make the lab well you can go

577
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:19,510
to map the left . come 80 so that's our
like our men's side and therefore wiki

578
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:24,760
there and there's everything documented
so therefore everything a wiki page like

579
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:29,230
for Wi-Fi for laser for everything and I
look for a happy surprise

580
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:39,640
okay . here so let's use the sector
surprise so that are called vending

581
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,640
machine

582
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:58,440
so it's yeah plus cool minnows sheet arm
and we can buy your linos tables

583
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:05,940
chocolate whatever see if the page for
real morning just to the metal and get

584
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:12,660
them for me take a surprise and we have
great chocolate in it so if you're dying

585
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:17,640
you can get chocolate off it and our
else sometimes there is a drama if

586
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:24,029
they're not chocolate in it and then our
people crazy with the drama with these

587
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:29,550
others a picture of you to think
shipping so we have all the cool bar

588
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:36,840
which shows how cool it is at the middle
lab so that's our soup blocks omegle

589
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:44,460
about soup thought I'd all and so
there's one guy died before the member

590
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:52,050
of Metalab so if other particular
machine and somewhere there should be a

591
00:59:52,050 --> 01:00:05,340
that's like one relative the of the wall
we put it on the wall we farm sprayed on

592
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:09,240
the wall artist not known 2009

593
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:22,190
so this repeater there in the back
that's our drama bar where it shows the

594
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:27,140
current drama level intimated the lab so
people can press the plus or the minus

595
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:30,740
button and if they think that's great
everything the past the present and past

596
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:34,790
button if you think everything shoot the
president minus partner have like a

597
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:42,230
status how how good or bad as in the
middle app currently now 44 cool web

598
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:43,400
interface

599
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:53,600
I think you should put up a better
picture there and yeah i will just go

600
01:00:53,600 --> 01:01:01,310
them by to the Q&A or just here see
through the drama bar so even people are

601
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:05,990
brewing beer in the mid the lab so you
should also make a group which doing

602
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:13,399
beer so it's made me to boise ID bail
angles

603
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:23,800
so that's our drama bar and it's a
really great project where I in turn the

604
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:28,630
summer in the Metalab made some stuff
there and he built the web interface

605
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:35,380
where kill just of adjust the color the
color of the whole drama bar and there

606
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:39,730
are the buttons for good and bad and if
it's full

607
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:51,370
it has rainbow colors and well first of
all thanks for listening to the talk i

608
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:55,660
hope you liked it and I was left for Q&A
if you have some questions about the

609
01:01:55,660 --> 01:02:02,170
headspace about problems that we have
social and solve so if you're feelin

610
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:09,250
questions please ask and it will be glad
to answer you don't be shy

611
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:30,530
yeah I saw him I'm not blind but
sometimes are so what software do you

612
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:35,450
use for membership and finance
management and is it important what

613
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:41,870
software to use our well it is important
to have some some some management to

614
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:47,750
like like calc or like expo it's what
one thing you can use you can use a key

615
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:52,310
topic account for this I mean you should
use some some stuff for management like

616
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:56,630
we have to remember measure with the
middle operating system it's like a web

617
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:58,700
interface where we match our members

618
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:05,810
it's like self coded so you should have
like you saw a tool for imagine your

619
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:09,799
members Africa don't depend on
technology used for this there are some

620
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:14,750
some finished products for that other
the CDC is working on something for this

621
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:21,740
and for the finance stuff we have a
simple cock sheet very putting all the

622
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:29,330
money we get into all the money we get
out and we have our extra pay our extra

623
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:36,259
company which may call the finance stuff
the the rest so we put all the papers

624
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:40,250
together and give it to them and they
really make it them for display stuff

625
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:47,810
first text stop them like that we have a
big a big picture of all the finance

626
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:50,200
stuff

627
01:03:50,200 --> 01:04:01,509
the CC that's coming out to see probably
over the west which is mature it was

628
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:09,040
coded during we get when the Medellin
was founded and has been monkey edge

629
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:16,690
ever since so it's like a working health
sometimes but people are fixing time by

630
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:20,560
time box and implementing features but
it also depends how big is your

631
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:24,910
headspace I mean if you have likes only
30 members you can have like a simple

632
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:26,529
list with people and you

633
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,829
it's really easier to manage you have
like only ten to fourteen members

634
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:33,640
it's a real other total a totally other
finger feels like over a hundred members

635
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:38,020
so there's also depends on the member
sighs how you manage your stuff you for

636
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:42,490
sure need something to manage it and if
like some big picture of the whole of

637
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:47,709
process so what money will come in what
money have to go out if I kept the

638
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:51,970
management tool there are also some some
process management tools which you which

639
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:57,819
like a good to use like where you can
build a process for a chain and then you

640
01:04:57,819 --> 01:05:05,140
just can go from process . processed .
like I start know the the membership

641
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:07,569
collection remember collection at all

642
01:05:07,569 --> 01:05:12,369
I putting the membership collected stuff
so that's also thing we think about to

643
01:05:12,369 --> 01:05:16,150
use this subset of project management
tool there's some something open source

644
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:20,470
for this so it's like I said well
depends how much member so if you have

645
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:27,879
more than 100 members it's much harder
to to manage this then like 10 25 50

646
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,690
members

647
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:35,310
yes that's also one one one thing that
we are struggling with automating the

648
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:40,770
stuff it's not easy but we are working
lead to ultimate as much as possible but

649
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:45,690
something's up easy especially the
shitty banking software from the shit

650
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:52,109
banks it's really pain-in-the-ass your
we have imported you have to export it

651
01:05:52,109 --> 01:05:55,740
you have to check out of people bounce
or it didn't

652
01:05:55,740 --> 01:06:00,000
couldn't get the money from the people
you have its really it's hard to

653
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:10,530
automate the cost a really implemented
software it's only working windows like

654
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:17,910
in Germany so office really shitty what
about banks like a little bit jealous of

655
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:21,390
the Germans because if you have quite
good banking software error standard

656
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:24,540
stuff

657
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:31,290
well what's better well depends very
hard in Vienna so you can offer sheet

658
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:33,450
interconnection BMI in the center

659
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:37,259
don't worry there is another question

660
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:42,690
ok i'm interested what's the difference
between the chocolate cake in the

661
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:51,690
sidekick the difference between which
cakes the the chocolate one and the

662
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:52,500
other

663
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:59,040
ah i see well the ones i would say the
hipster cake for people have too much

664
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:04,710
money and the other was like four people
jeff like normal people that don't have

665
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:07,440
don't want to pay 50 or for cake

666
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,150
it's quite expensive to pay it cost like
fifty years from the very well-known

667
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:18,300
stock hotel which they made and get even
in a boot enclosure the whole cake it's

668
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:25,920
like a hipster cake for people too much
money it is it's good but but you have

669
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,150
to pay a lot of money for the cake so if
you have enough money you should try it

670
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:33,180
else get the normal chocolate cake is
all the great

671
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:43,550
if you have a bio lab there is a hex
base in austria in God's there for bio

672
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:54,440
lab yeah that support collaboration of
other spaces so i'll do that you can

673
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,440
learn from each other

674
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:09,049
this is another example of fishery that
makes but they are making the real

675
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:12,050
soccer but they can call it that way

676
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:24,620
flying all over the place so it's really
i'm going to get set

677
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:35,569
so in your experience what was the one
thing that newcomers have most problem

678
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:42,710
with i think the the hardest thing for
newcomers are registered financial stuff

679
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:47,270
like how to get enough money to have to
space running every month i think that's

680
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:53,540
one of the hardest things to manage
because you need the first some a car a

681
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:58,250
trash hold of people which can get
enough money to pay the rent

682
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:04,160
I think that's one of the hardest stuff
at the at the heck space and the second

683
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:07,189
power dress stuff i think is the
community stuff that there is a

684
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:12,169
community that the people can talk with
each other end to make together project

685
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:17,210
I think it's the second hardest thing to
build a community at local experience it

686
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:21,410
don't have faith like 50 people but
there although everything in groups and

687
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:26,720
the groups don't like each other so it's
better if likes 22 for people like our

688
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:30,950
community and can pop each other and
make to get a project that's the

689
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:32,059
important thing

690
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,720
but

691
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:41,070
I mean like if new people come to the
space I so I i misunderstood the

692
01:09:41,069 --> 01:09:41,969
question

693
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:50,580
there's also if new people come to the
space there are also some problems like

694
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:56,370
the first one it if you don't have if
you have like some unwritten rules like

695
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:59,820
just people know it and know where
stands

696
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:03,780
that's a big problem because the people
just tell the rule but it never know

697
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:09,090
where there it stands know very little
country it up so the thing is often that

698
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:13,200
people come to the space and they don't
know where to read up some stuff for

699
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,429
information

700
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:20,460
I mean we have all the infrastructure in
a wiki documented but there are some

701
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:25,830
stuff like rules or other things are not
documented this way so there should be

702
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:32,309
like some main side with some rules some
some people may vary the people can ask

703
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:36,840
them for questions so that should be
like some page for people can just stand

704
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:42,030
there and read up and has information
that's a big problem about the unknown

705
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:46,170
information which is in a space let let
me extend a little bit on that there's

706
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:51,120
also the issue of involved coming aliens
to the heck space so they come in

707
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:55,440
there's some some new guy on you girl
coming into the room and that just sent

708
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,280
their lonely at the phone booth and look
into the room and everyone in the

709
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,880
expertise just sitting there looking at
the laptops working on their projects

710
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,950
liking in the lounge playing mario cut
and nobody's welcoming the the alien so

711
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:10,980
that's something I've seen also another
X basis

712
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:16,530
you should really work on the procedure
on how to welcome somebody not known to

713
01:11:16,530 --> 01:11:22,620
need to the local to the local guys and
girls after that the second thing what

714
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:28,019
I've seen is we've got a monthly event
now going on and net net them well but

715
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:33,180
80 people not used to visiting x basis
or or heck events or conferences like

716
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:36,139
these is

717
01:11:36,139 --> 01:11:40,820
there's a culture clash you really have
to take them by hand and explain them to

718
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:45,558
you how this works how this community
works that there is a democracy if you

719
01:11:45,559 --> 01:11:49,189
do something you're right if it don't do
do something you're not allowed to

720
01:11:49,189 --> 01:11:56,510
complain stuff like that so things we if
we go to to Assisi Congress there's a

721
01:11:56,510 --> 01:12:01,999
lot of things if you just got taken for
granted and you have to explicitly

722
01:12:01,999 --> 01:12:07,519
explained that to the normal daylight
community people because they don't just

723
01:12:07,519 --> 01:12:11,059
don't get it how bout the artist
community or hardees heck spaces around

724
01:12:11,059 --> 01:12:16,880
so a lot of what is it love on
undocumented unsaid things that we take

725
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,349
for granted are just the you have to
explain to them

726
01:12:21,349 --> 01:12:25,039
yes you take the trash and just put it
away and if you find and then you

727
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:28,909
possibly take it with you even if it's
not your bottle basic stuff like that

728
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:33,919
you have to explain over and over and
over and over and over here you have to

729
01:12:33,919 --> 01:12:37,249
give to people of various of your local
community that if someone who comes

730
01:12:37,249 --> 01:12:41,959
there that we just go there is a high
and so you know new here and let the

731
01:12:41,959 --> 01:12:46,340
show your space so that's the thing that
you have to to tell your people of your

732
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:51,469
community if someone who is here come
here to get the people by hand and tried

733
01:12:51,469 --> 01:12:56,389
in space and tell them the rules because
it don't help someone comes Darren like

734
01:12:56,389 --> 01:13:00,019
standing there enough no clue and error
error 16 just there and look in their

735
01:13:00,019 --> 01:13:04,969
pcs because if you do it like this
people will come again if you go there

736
01:13:04,969 --> 01:13:09,889
and say hi how ru you're new here let's
show the space people who come again and

737
01:13:09,889 --> 01:13:11,090
that's the thing you want

738
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:15,320
yeah but then you have the problem of
the nodes that are not very outgoing so

739
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:16,280
they just sit there

740
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,559
oh my god somebody I don't know

741
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:25,610
it's not easy but that's the way you
have to go after various that new people

742
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:29,599
new people come that you have introduced
them to the space and don't just see oh

743
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,770
my god and you personally or what park
which one do you say go there is a high

744
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:38,150
shot into space showing the rules and
that's the way is to go to get new

745
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:43,580
people in the community also tell them
where to go where who to ask for some

746
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:48,410
stuff where you can get information or
what like the habits of the heck space

747
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:52,730
maybe to do some people there at the
local experts which are like now here's

748
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:56,120
oh hey just the guy he knows a Reno or
something like this that's really

749
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:59,390
important because if people come there
and they're like feel insecure and no

750
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:02,720
one helps them they will not come again
because they stay wash come here because

751
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:07,400
no one soars into space no one wants me
to help when you come to a new drop or

752
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:11,780
error also people come here and tells
you how to start somehow or university

753
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:17,540
or at school so you need some mentor
that comes to you for the first time and

754
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:22,519
charged with around that's really
important to talk to acquire new people

755
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,340
without this it will not American

756
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:28,730
you will also make me lose other people
which think why should be there in our

757
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:34,339
people don't have their awareness and
don't do stuff like extending on that

758
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:39,200
you can also think about having like a
regular like monthly open door event

759
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:45,769
where you invite the daylight society to
come to your headspace and work on the

760
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:49,970
culture clash and introduce them to what
your people do and how they think about

761
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:54,890
society and politics and building
projects and working together and all

762
01:14:54,890 --> 01:15:00,050
that stuff like to have a dedicated
open-door event where people who are

763
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:07,670
more shy and don't dare to go alone into
a suitable place like one level down and

764
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:11,810
liquids all dark here and because
somebody broke the light switch or

765
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:16,460
something and they don't feel well going
there alone but if you have a larger

766
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:19,190
event where a group of people can come

767
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:23,150
that usually works pretty well so we
have something like this is called me

768
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:28,309
today I mean that even froze some time
ago because no one wanted to do it again

769
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:30,829
so we like resurrection them from the
deaths

770
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:36,469
it's called me today very invite
speakers from outside to some

771
01:15:36,469 --> 01:15:39,889
interesting topic with like bright
topics were only technical stuff all the

772
01:15:39,889 --> 01:15:47,149
like net politics and biohacking so it's
really not only on ter and it's like

773
01:15:47,149 --> 01:15:51,769
like they have opened or people come
from everywhere and see the space and

774
01:15:51,769 --> 01:15:57,139
have a cool talk and chill out and talk
to each other it's like our event to to

775
01:15:57,139 --> 01:16:00,919
introduce people to overhead space we
invite some interesting people from

776
01:16:00,919 --> 01:16:04,459
outside they have a cool talk afterwards
they're socializing and people are

777
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:06,559
trying the Metalab how it's working

778
01:16:06,559 --> 01:16:11,510
so that's like up approach to get new
people there so maybe he can have some

779
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:16,999
event like an event open door every
month or every week we have to have my

780
01:16:16,999 --> 01:16:21,559
fixed time from from five to eight in
the evening or five to ten in the

781
01:16:21,559 --> 01:16:24,979
evening where people new people
especially for new people events and do

782
01:16:24,979 --> 01:16:30,949
children the space and the habit so
that's also our solution to introduce

783
01:16:30,949 --> 01:16:35,629
new people to come to the community and
give them like a help out to be there

784
01:16:35,629 --> 01:16:44,899
and do you have experience with working
with schools where children going to

785
01:16:44,899 --> 01:16:47,570
learn about html5 whatever

786
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:53,629
yes we have sometimes some projects like
inventing schools like there is some

787
01:16:53,629 --> 01:16:58,159
approach like making solving workshops
that's a good idea to invite invite

788
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:03,768
schools 2x pace and have some soldering
if solving day with them so that

789
01:17:03,769 --> 01:17:09,499
approach to you need a concept for this
but a really simple countries like just

790
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:14,119
make a hole during evening with the the
kids showed him how to solder make some

791
01:17:14,119 --> 01:17:21,259
simple kids for it some blinky thing is
that's one approach to introduce kids to

792
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:25,729
this topic but you need a concept you
need some context like you have to write

793
01:17:25,729 --> 01:17:29,749
to some teachers so stuff like this but
if you have a good concept and you can

794
01:17:29,749 --> 01:17:34,820
really sell it to the teacher it can
work but you have like you need

795
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:39,018
something to show them and it's always
really good approach for this

796
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:48,360
simple kids already it's better than two
hours that doesn't

797
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:54,660
and it's also important to like
introduce kids in this in this area

798
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:59,040
because they have a lot of creativity
and one of ideas and if you show that

799
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:04,290
it's also going another way with hacking
and soldiering and it makes fun

800
01:18:04,290 --> 01:18:08,670
especially not only for boys are for
girls it's also important that there C

801
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:12,750
let's take it easy really cool and i can
make cool stuff because there are a lot

802
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:16,650
of girls in tech and it's important to
have more girls in tech and with such

803
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:21,059
actions you can enforce that more girls
coming text because it makes fun it's

804
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:27,600
easy to solder so that's for it if you
have some questions can come by after

805
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,070
parts and talk with me

806
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:32,490
else if you're Indiana not come to a
local tech space in the evening there

807
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:36,150
often people there else you can write
the email thank you for listening

808
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,469
yeah
