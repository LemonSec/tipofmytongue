1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:27,160
i'm sure most of you here are such
security experts aren't you huh

2
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,890
so I'm not that special so I'm going to
start with little background us how I

3
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,480
how I got to this idea i've been brewing
is me for some time actually

4
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:48,399
so it was 2010 i was studying in Sweden
and I got a great idea for a master's

5
00:00:48,399 --> 00:01:00,190
tvs i was gonna try and understand Skype
if some of you may not remember anymore

6
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,479
skype oh that's cool technology where he
could chat and and send pictures and

7
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,830
videos and everything right

8
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,179
no one uses that anymore but six years
ago it was the thing it was it worked

9
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,190
everywhere so there are many questions
about how it works is it secure is it

10
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,800
back the word is really fair to peer are
someone listening in on our

11
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:27,220
conversations so I selected that as my
preliminary master status

12
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:33,430
some of you might know why did not
actually finish my thesis using that

13
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:43,660
topic because skype lawyered up so i was
i was living in Sweden at the time and I

14
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,610
heard a doorbell

15
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,930
one day there was a gorgeous blonde
woman standing at the door but

16
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,630
unfortunately she didn't want any fun
she just wanted me to sign some papers

17
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:02,080
so signed receipt of of some super
important super secret document I've

18
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,630
actually given a short presentation on
the legal side of all this story at 2073

19
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:14,470
couple years ago arm so you can look
that up but basically skype said well

20
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,050
you gotta stop what you're doing great
everything and never user

21
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:25,600
product again which I happily obliged
the last one I mean so I was cut out how

22
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:33,640
it happened i did not have proper
anonymity so they found me in the end I

23
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,649
didn't have to pay anything but they
went after me for a year-and-a-half even

24
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,990
after i change the country they found me
again the letter in the mail so it

25
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,580
happened probably because it was done i
use my real name real country Sweden are

26
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:56,950
in my skype profile they were smart they
can access to some databases access to

27
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,839
lawyers so I learned that having real
name and telephone number is

28
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,890
$FULLPHONENUM and luxury you don't
usually need to take to use services

29
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,700
that's why i don't use what's up for
example well there is a veteran now two

30
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,339
weeks already

31
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:19,990
but also i became interested in the
technical part defendant anonymity and

32
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:27,880
that is what this lecture is about so a
little bit about me I myself come from

33
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:36,940
latvia not Sweden where I was studying
is my first time at bulk own and like

34
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:44,079
many of you I started programming when I
was seven years old but I started doing

35
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,770
that in the homebrew Computer now don't
get me wrong I didn't solder it i didn't

36
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,700
i didn't know much anything about trying
to the point but some of my relatives

37
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,040
made made it and they moved to a better
occupation so they gave it gave it away

38
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,040
and seven years old I started mashing
the buttons and and drawing circles and

39
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,390
and learning about sinuses and cosine
systems and stuff like that so our

40
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,708
that's that that's probably story for
for at least some i think many of you

41
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,260
here in this audience today

42
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:21,310
what was different that point is that
not like most of you probably i did not

43
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,050
have access to the internet for the
first eight years of my working with

44
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,340
computers so

45
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,229
was it was a fun time it was a different
time you can actually keep a lot of

46
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,930
information in your head

47
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,210
no online lookups of function parameters
you for good so PHP could not have lived

48
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,919
back then right with all the random
random sequences of function parameters

49
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,609
there are so you started programming and
and then I gradually moved to

50
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,680
administration that happened through
hacking so I was in the seventh grade

51
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:08,419
that's personally seven years seven
years later arm and you know people's

52
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:11,960
often often get fed up with their
teachers so I got fed up with one

53
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,580
t-shirt remember the subject are and i
decided i should spoof an email i should

54
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:23,900
use her source source email address to
write a terrible terrible email to one

55
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,760
of the admins are in the school i was
studying are choosing the destination

56
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,760
addresses one of them is probably not a
smart idea

57
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:40,039
I did write it was it was an ugly email
and my surprise week later they found me

58
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:46,490
even though i took the precaution of
going all the way to a different

59
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,440
apartment in my building to my friend's
apartment they actually they actually

60
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,000
manage of course look at the header find
the IP address find the real home

61
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,820
address and look the people database
where you know I my address was only

62
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:08,330
different by the apartment number so so
they got me that way are also during the

63
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:17,150
period I I tried I tried to mix my
programming skills with this new

64
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,679
administration thing that was going on
up some of you may remember a program

65
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,460
called windows 95 there was an export
for it called when Duke who knows when

66
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:37,640
you okay couple couple couple old old
old people here that they're okay I'm

67
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:43,190
all to my doctor said that I'm that I'm
finally old hag when I went to him at

68
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,190
one month ago that sorry your old
nothing we can do about that

69
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:55,789
if only so anyway when York is it is a
fun story so remember I did I didn't

70
00:06:55,789 --> 00:07:01,130
have internet at home so I I looked up I
i looked up at the speck of of the

71
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,990
exploiter online on script a level right
school I went back home when I had more

72
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:11,419
time I opened my i think it was either
as a visual basic or Delphie so I opened

73
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:15,049
that I I wrote in my payload everything
that ethanol my computer had one

74
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,190
computer to come right

75
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:21,320
I tested it bomb got the blue screen of
death on my computer perfect so no other

76
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,580
computers test on so went to school
that's the draws an IP address of a

77
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:32,180
neighborhood computer perfect . is there
so it worked by using that BS tcp 139

78
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,250
arm you set an urgent flag on all that's
beyond the point of the presentation

79
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:43,880
anyway so so I thought okay but you know
people people use these cool or cool

80
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,460
things called the DNS names are referred
to computers and I could just type and

81
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:56,659
another that point at my school all the
computers had had a domain local domain

82
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:59,810
names for letter names really easy to
type so I thought what I want that

83
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,310
additional functionality in my in my
cool exploit here

84
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:09,020
so again I looked up to the manual there
was a function called get coached by

85
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:15,109
name so we added that inside that sitcom
again my only computer no internet or

86
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:21,469
bluescreen best I went back to school
are against it like a future look at the

87
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:25,190
coast and to my left I poutine press the
button

88
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:30,560
suddenly my computer get the North Korea
best I thought you ok gotta get to fix

89
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,940
that I look left

90
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,409
that also works great i look right that
also work i turned out the classroom all

91
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:40,968
the computers got blue scared s
apparently also also computer is not in

92
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,310
the classroom the call school was a
single subject so

93
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,729
everybody got a little scared as I
quickly shut the thing down right away

94
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:54,630
so i don't know if they if I know that
it was me but so apparently function

95
00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:01,200
function gets called by name returned
minus one in case of an error are so I

96
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,100
didn't configure dns servers or
something in in the code so i get minus

97
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,930
1 then we have the signed and unsigned
integer saying right and n minus 1 is

98
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:17,880
also FF FF r which in decimal is
$OPERAND to 54 x which is broadcast on

99
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:26,189
the network so a small bug there anyway
so here today I'm going back to my roots

100
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:32,550
I'm still an inventor at heart even
though I I work mostly with security now

101
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,240
moved on to that of course and and
recently also cyber security policy

102
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,870
paperwork Nouriel normal damage their
arm but i wanna i wanna talk to you

103
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,170
about something guy i can find it i mean
i did a google search

104
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,430
I didn't find anything like that but i
didn't i didn't a proper academic look

105
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,010
up maybe someone cover this crap just
like 10 years but that would be a bummer

106
00:09:53,010 --> 00:10:01,680
well okay so what is this talk about
here i want to introduce Simpson the

107
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,150
world are and I want to have a
discussion with you guys and gals here

108
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:11,010
on real-life applications of the
technology and I also would like to hear

109
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:17,430
your critique and comments on my
proposal of course code edits are very

110
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:26,520
welcome to so I think it's a really
important for everyone to be able to

111
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,459
follow what I am to what I'm about to
tell here so I'd like you to be able to

112
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:36,359
do this regardless of your background so
those of you who how many of you have a

113
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,900
networking background in your
professional or packing careers bit less

114
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:48,089
on top okay so I want everyone else to
understand what I'm talking about so

115
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:52,980
we're gonna go soo through some some
basic basics we're going to cover I

116
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,590
saucy model

117
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:00,380
all the layers we're going to look at
the CP and UDP and again I want to

118
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,920
emphasize think understanding is really
understanding the basics really

119
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,969
important I remember myself in lectures
at the University sometimes you know you

120
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:16,490
you you're bored then you suddenly mr.
topic and then the rest of the course is

121
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,780
unintelligible to you just basically use
so i don't want that happened

122
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,430
ok so we're going to spend spend some
time here on this chart this is of

123
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:35,780
course known as iso OSI model arm it's
one of the ways how to look at data

124
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,189
that's traveling network through our
single Network there's also the tcp/ip

125
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:46,010
model which is simpler ate it basically
groups layer 1 and two together and we

126
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:51,470
have straight for and groups 567
together arm but this allows for four

127
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,130
more precision i somehow you know the
academic and he wants to use this which

128
00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:01,400
has more detailed it so let's go can
talk in detail about what this is what

129
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:09,199
it is out of the picture here is the
media the wire or whatever the media is

130
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,430
it it's on the bottom there so your wire
is there and on the top

131
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,449
what's called a rate is a user it's you
sitting get your application your

132
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,290
computer so when you type something in
the application it goes through all the

133
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,939
layers to to reach the media and when
information comes to you and you receive

134
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,070
an email for example it comes from layer
0 all through these layers to reach you

135
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:36,920
on top of layer 7 so let's take a look
at physical layer here

136
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:51,870
so in the physical layer of the Peace of
the one piece of information because

137
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:59,280
it's called a bit now all of you have
heard of it i'm sure 01 right and its

138
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,740
physical layer in includes some method
of representing representing Bates

139
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:13,560
manchester encoding for for legacy isn't
that the slow one and it also deals ways

140
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,050
the physical representation of course of
of your bits so for example on the wire

141
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:25,349
you might have voltage levels are actual
also journals like real world that's

142
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,030
that's where we have the real world and
later one we might have optic fiber with

143
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:35,160
with different patterns of of lasers
going in we might have a radio if we're

144
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,060
using Wi-Fi or some other obscure
protocol are we might use pigeons

145
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,660
there's actually I think there are sea
on using pigeons for transmitting you

146
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,660
can actually do it with our pigeon I
mean if you have the physical layer set

147
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:54,480
up so the goal of physical layer is to
transmit and receive raw streams over

148
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,470
the physical medium arm there's nothing
much a theoretical scientists can do

149
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,100
there

150
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:08,670
so let's look at layer to the data link
layer are it's a layer that contains the

151
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:13,500
mac address and and this is where we're
not network people's really listening so

152
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:20,730
mac address is a supposedly a unique
address assigned only to your network

153
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:26,940
cards in your device armed it consists
of six bytes is usually represented to

154
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,880
the effects like starting 00 up to FF
and the blues with colons we're going to

155
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,460
have a demo and then so so you should
you should understand that so we have

156
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:45,150
frames on data link layer and just how
it's called data link layer arm is only

157
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:51,300
relevant on the same physical networks
so its goal is to allow for reliable

158
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:56,040
transmission of frames between notes
that reside on the same physical network

159
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,649
so unless there's some physical medium
connected

160
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:02,879
between the two nodes data link layer
alone is not enough we'll go we'll need

161
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:10,079
to go up to network layer layer 3 the
network layer it contains the packets

162
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:18,300
oh right for that link layer are an
example as a rent right so network layer

163
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:24,599
it contains the packet and here we know
of course everybody knows ipv6 then

164
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,850
there's also a more obscure particle
called ipv4 that's also sometimes used

165
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:37,679
and ICMP is another example I would give
network layer the oldest routing traffic

166
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:44,699
control and internet addressing in the
original idea of how the debate model

167
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,699
was created and now the founding fathers
wanted it to work

168
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:52,829
apparently it should be able to select
the source IP address in this nation IP

169
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:57,209
address and it would not change for the
lifespan of the packet it would actually

170
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:02,790
reach the destination computer that has
that IP address IP addresses of course a

171
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:09,059
part of the network layer packet are at
layer for the transport layer we add the

172
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:14,939
thing called port so for HIV address
what's called computer freaking future

173
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:27,089
you can have a specific for starting
from zero to 65,535 40 isn't really used

174
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:29,670
but you can actually use it but it's a
different tack not going to talk about

175
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:35,519
that either so examples here tcp and UDP
segment is the name for daytime layer

176
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,389
for if using TCP so that segment and the
data Graham is for UDP so we're going to

177
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:47,309
have a separate slides on tcp and UDP
now we're not going to go into details

178
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:52,829
on the upper layers in part because they
always confuse me I mean the division

179
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:57,149
between layer 5 and later six is really
blurry for me I think for most of you

180
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:04,260
are right so but they taste called data
on layer 56 and seven armed it is

181
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:09,720
basically your application with every
cab like Apache with or without pls

182
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:14,039
your application top of Apache that's
that's all in there and then we have

183
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:19,319
user on top so final thing I want to say
for the slide here is there is a process

184
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,119
called and cancellation and a process
called the cancellation and capsulation

185
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:29,850
simply means going from the user down
through there through what we have here

186
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:37,289
on the screen and encapsulating the user
data adding different headers and

187
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:48,900
footers to it so if say you want to send
an email that says that teachers can

188
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:57,330
then you would have that on what we call
a rate and layer seven six and five

189
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,928
would encapsulate it may be changed
something right if you have some special

190
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:04,650
characters and there they will be
changed on these layers transport layer

191
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:11,130
without the port 25 network layer
through some quite not get process we

192
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:17,340
would have found out there p address it
would have the IP address of the they

193
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,480
mail server where the mail is about to
be delivered and of course the source

194
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,400
source IP address of my neighbor data
link layer would contain local mac

195
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,970
addresses on that Network segments so
those would change when the when the

196
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,299
frame is destroyed and created visit go
through the internet and physical layer

197
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:40,980
of course depends depends on the medium
right and the calculation is the same so

198
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,789
for every Network device it goes down to
the physical and backup

199
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:55,620
ok so let's take a look at tcp vs UDP
let's compare these two popular later

200
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:03,418
for protocols so features of tcp of PCP
is a state full connection-oriented

201
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,700
protocol it means it's remembers the
state it's in it doesn't have to send

202
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:15,840
all the previous data relating to your
session are with every packet sorry with

203
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,658
every segment arm it actually has enough
information so that computers and other

204
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:22,840
natural devices have to read

205
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,310
member what's happening there was tcp
and it's a it allows for creation of

206
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:31,210
connections we're going to take a look
at that right in a compliment here

207
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:37,360
it provides what's called reliable
transport meaning that are meaning that

208
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,990
it tries to it really tries hard to
deliver the message

209
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,429
so if you should come back like in 10
minutes when we when we talk about real

210
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:50,260
stuff and unnatural guys sorry it's a
bit boring right and ok so it's kind of

211
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,460
reliable I mean it really tries to make
sure the message delivered and if it

212
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:01,510
doesn't rise again so it has some
notable features for example the

213
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:06,460
three-way handshake also one more speed
one more thing to see because our flags

214
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:13,360
for the tcp segment there are numerous
flags like like around ten three-way

215
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,590
handshake is a process that tells two
parties to IP addresses client and

216
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,209
server that the connection has been
established between them so a packet

217
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:26,770
with sin flag set is sent server replies
with a packet that has a ck

218
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:32,230
acknowledgement and the since likes both
that and then the client finally replies

219
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:37,510
with a tacit acknowledgement flight of
like set and that creates a connection

220
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,440
between the mouth each of them including
all the devices in the middle

221
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,780
remember that a connection is open are
of course the connection can also be

222
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:52,270
turned down when it ended the party
would like to close the connection send

223
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,500
packet with flag set we get an
acknowledgement and feedback and then we

224
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,370
send an acknowledgement so the only
thing changes is in changes to Finn it's

225
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:06,219
quite so easy protocol actually up so it
also has error detection like check

226
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,840
something and confirmations the
acknowledgement flag we talked about our

227
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,939
it allows for ordered transfers so all
the segments have a6 sequence numbers

228
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:23,920
and as packets and segments within those
packets would sometimes take different

229
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,380
parts on the internet they might come to
the recipient in the in different order

230
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,810
tcp allows for that to happen

231
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:38,020
it's fine it actually ordered them in
the correct order at the destination and

232
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,040
flow control since coast have different
network quality and the network speeds

233
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,840
in latency it is important

234
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,820
PCP is also something called window that
allows you to control the speed of flow

235
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:56,800
but let's look at UDP it's it's it's
more useful to us here for this talk it

236
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,240
is space station 10 transaction rented
so coasts are not required to remember

237
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:08,860
anything about about UDP session let's
call session because it's not the

238
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,570
connection

239
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:16,360
this is a but intermediate intermediate
devices like firewalls or routers still

240
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:23,320
try to infer when a UDP connection is
happening just metadata some car

241
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,800
actually has an ice pack that uses this
feature of UDP that allows you to

242
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,690
connect to host behind the net without
the middleman you should look that up

243
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:38,350
with you haven't heard about that so it
is a best-effort transferred it just

244
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,800
sends a packet and that's it i mean if
it's if it's delivered that's fine it's

245
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:51,850
not known cares are so some notable
features include it's simple

246
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,610
it has non control mechanism 7003 it
doesn't trust the date again so this is

247
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:02,110
this is the UDP datagram is just a
source port destination port length

248
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:07,780
checksum and and the datasource it's
really simple even like 10 times more

249
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:13,480
simple than the tcp we had guys saying
that 75-percent of statistics are made

250
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,140
up i just made up that number ten times
but well it's simple

251
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:25,300
ok so you a piece perfect for what we're
trying to do here are let's look about

252
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,919
let's look at an Internet here's here's
a comic for you so you have seen that

253
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,360
right on the internet nobody knows
you're a dog so unlimited internet can't

254
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,629
exist right but i found one more comic
here so

255
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:45,019
here's a Coast saying that our next
guest has chosen to remain anonymous

256
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:49,759
circle remain because the screen during
the interview please welcome mr. Isaac

257
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:57,559
Phillips h26 from Amarillo Texas so is a
limited internet real my skype story

258
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:05,418
tells now the fact that we have tour
also tells us something but is more

259
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:10,460
effective against eight attackers the
current research which your community

260
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:17,690
eagerly tries to ignore says no it's not
really effective and I i joined the

261
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:24,950
research in that opinion are so one
final thing up on the network

262
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:31,490
here's the random Network background I
pulled from the internet and so let's

263
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:37,309
let's talk about how routing works on
later three earlier in this room there

264
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:43,610
was a dog by anymore and it was titled
why can't we have nice things

265
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,669
while our this slide should explain why
can't we have a limited in the network

266
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:56,539
so we have three networks here indicated
by those blobs of different color we

267
00:24:56,539 --> 00:25:05,600
have two routers so how routing works is
that one for example this pc one on the

268
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:13,189
bottom in the yellow in the yellow blob
tries to connect the pc three it has to

269
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:16,369
set the IP address somewhere

270
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:22,610
well it usually says the pictures today
. recipe 330 does 0203 otherwise the

271
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:29,299
routers in between indicated by the
router symbol and cutting text router

272
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:34,908
below those would not know which
interface the forward through so say a

273
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:41,509
pc one would like to send data pc3 but
would like to analyze the destination

274
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:49,490
address say send it to 1000 to router
one would actually send information to

275
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,900
the blue blob instead it's a green one
and PC would never get the data so

276
00:25:53,900 --> 00:26:02,300
changing ip's or hiding a piece in later
threes least to fail so we have a

277
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,950
problem

278
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,660
IPL alteration fails i beez our own
layer three are needed for routing

279
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:14,300
that's why we can't simply remove them
from there are we cannot encrypt them of

280
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,690
course we have ipsec but it's a
different story

281
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:24,980
it doesn't work so yes we have a problem
here so I propose a solution i use more

282
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:31,610
bandwidth so with that cons that I
frequent often have this sign arm up

283
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:38,419
first years at the catkins i was i was
wondering why why do they have this

284
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:44,360
signup really couldn't understand that
but but well as years went by I I think

285
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:52,760
I figured out so the bandwidth has been
paid for so why not use it rides

286
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:03,370
this is this is real statistic it's not
it's not invented so more speed

287
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:10,989
everywhere is what we are getting in my
hotel here in Serbia of my big speeds

288
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:15,700
for the Wi-Fi my hotel reach four
megabytes per second

289
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,529
I'm lucky right not everybody has that
kind of tell butt but i mean that's

290
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:27,070
that's something our in Latvia where I
come from our normal home internet

291
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:34,149
connection is usually between 100
megabits per second up to half a gigabit

292
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:41,739
per second we are think the the force
fourth country in the world ranked by in

293
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:48,519
Texas space so Japan because it has a
better are so let's fill the values then

294
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:53,799
we need more data grams it is a
statistical solution that I will provide

295
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:58,029
to you it's that basically makes it less
likely for therefore an adversary to

296
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:03,909
determine your IP address so all the
network girls should now pay attention

297
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:06,309
again so we finished the network control

298
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:14,889
ok so i present to you sick source IP
spoofing for a minimization over UDP

299
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:27,908
let's look at a small overview of how
this technology works six protocol goes

300
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:30,789
on top of layer for but below later
three

301
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:37,509
so here's a here's a cool diagram so you
could consider it a tunneling protocol

302
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:43,090
this way are because it allows later
three where they really like the others

303
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:50,168
are to be incorporated on top of it
again but it's it's actually if you look

304
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:55,120
at the network stack on the wire it it
looks as layer 5 protocol from that

305
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,678
perspective and we will see that in
wireshark of course if someone wants to

306
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,620
write the patch for white sharks to
interpret this there are more than

307
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,850
welcome

308
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:10,809
so the idea is sending multiple UDP
datagrams for each single bedroom that

309
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:11,250
should be

310
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:21,060
Emily sent ideas easy enough are in
those multiple datagrams on layer 3 the

311
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:26,940
IP addresses are replaced the source and
destination IP these are randomized so

312
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:35,100
for example we would get one real packet
was a real source and IP and 63 fake

313
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,600
packets with all the possible
combinations of fake source IP address

314
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,959
is generated and fake this nation that
is generated also the current version

315
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:53,490
uses the IP version in layers are why is
it important to use them to generate new

316
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,870
pairs there's something called PCP 38
which will have a slide on much later

317
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:05,879
today and this presentation though bc
p38 my block stuff going from different

318
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:12,270
subjects so we just to make sure we also
create 11 IP addresses in the same

319
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,740
subject when the same classy are but if
we can just that then it'd be easy for

320
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,100
the adversary defines a real subjects so
we do that for all the subjects

321
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:25,530
including the fake ones protocol of
course allows for expansion version

322
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,170
support that's possible

323
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,880
current version version 4 choose ip's
within classy network so we don't bother

324
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,080
with finding the actual actual subject
is relevant for impact our outside your

325
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:42,600
network so and metadata currently
includes the real IP addresses and the

326
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,480
list of the fake IP addresses used in an
encrypted form payload is not encrypted

327
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,460
because we have the less for that if
someone wants to do that were any any

328
00:30:53,460 --> 00:31:02,880
other type of my pset whatever so a
single TCP packet is being sent here i

329
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,040
have a question to the audience which IP
addresses communicating with which any

330
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,379
guesses

331
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,920
yeah

332
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,920
you can you can refer to the right
answer but the line number

333
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:22,580
look at that

334
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:36,730
ok so one more thinks it does is it it
always select the same the same list of

335
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:42,610
fake source and destination IPS for
specific network parameters so and those

336
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:46,090
brands include real sergeant stationed
piece so that's that's thought about

337
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:52,000
anyway the right answer is like 25 but
as you can see it's not really possible

338
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:01,540
to do that to figure it out from this
screen so it should work i think our but

339
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:09,010
right now it's a nice addition with a
lot of asterisks and will of course

340
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,080
discuss possible problems with that

341
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,970
so this is my proposed format as
implemented inversions there are four of

342
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:22,540
the protocol i hope everyone can can
read the phones they're so we have a

343
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:29,860
header that just a ski is as the pizza
in asking 5 bytes we have reserved bites

344
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:37,659
that's always zero at first I at first I
had the version numbers are because the

345
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,620
first iteration of the protocol it's the
version number is also asking which was

346
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,699
a waste of time i decided to make it
binary arm so now we have reserved by

347
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,060
there which is cool we can use it so we
can set it to one when the protocol is

348
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,379
actually used in production

349
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:56,770
ok so version version bite says has
version 0 4 in this example are in in in

350
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:06,790
this version of the product then we have
a then we have length of the metadata r

351
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:11,080
is $OPERAND / 16 bytes because we
encrypt the metadata and and we can save

352
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,550
space that might are so there's also a
limitation here we can have you cannot

353
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:19,389
have an infinite number of sources IP
addresses in this example because it has

354
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:29,290
to fit in 16 x 256 bytes x services but
we have the initialization vector 16

355
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:33,639
bytes it's random for every original
datagram and the same for every every

356
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,200
duplicate effect diagram

357
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,870
and then we have a blog that's encrypted
with ASD 56 CBC mode sixteen byte block

358
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:46,389
our total size of that can be can be
found by the formula metal n minus 1 x

359
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:51,789
16 bytes now i should i should stress
and I can't stress this enough that even

360
00:33:51,789 --> 00:33:57,639
though I've taken some crypto intro our
university many years ago i'm not i'm

361
00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:01,090
not really equipped experts are probably
the Crypt insecure don't use that in

362
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:04,389
production but it's well I couldn't
break it but you can never break your

363
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:10,929
own stuff right so and then you have
become the payload so here's an example

364
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:17,139
of the datagram oh it's nicely colored
so we have you can see the blue one but

365
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:21,730
it does matter said just as later three
so that's the underlying information

366
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:27,460
whatever that is layer 3 is where the
fake addresses are the the blue one you

367
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:32,020
can see and then we begin with six in
dark blue and then we have a all

368
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,980
information there

369
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:38,139
the larger portion in in brownish is
encrypted part and then payload is

370
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:43,780
implanted that you can see it starts
with e 45 are so it starts with layers

371
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,780
three IP packet header

372
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:59,790
ok now let's take a look at bc p38 real
briefly it's the best current practice

373
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:04,290
so this slide talks about wires why
things aren't as good as they could be

374
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,550
it's 16 years old so it should be
implemented everywhere right

375
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,290
well it's not really implement
everywhere it talks about network

376
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,860
ingress filtering which means that your
provider should check the source IP

377
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,370
address of your computer to make sure
that it's within the range

378
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:27,420
Thank packets are not forwarded this is
supposed to solve denial-of-service

379
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,620
attacks it does not really solve them i
mean it worked well for some time for

380
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:36,810
that worked was implemented but it's not
widely adopted and the noodle service

381
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,610
techniques have emerged for example our
botanist and these things don't rely on

382
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:48,240
source IP spoofing necessarily so let's
take a look at six results

383
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:55,830
the good the bad and the demo so bc p38
has been partially implemented which

384
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:01,799
allows us for greater success rate 62
may provide an additional layer of

385
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,080
anonymity it needs to be combined with
other techniques though it also provides

386
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:12,120
the ability UDP doesn't do
acknowledgement if you configure your

387
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:19,710
box correctly UDP also does not send
icmp original packet so if you make sure

388
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:26,130
to do that it's really allows for some
some nice legal magic to happen

389
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:33,000
I'm not a lawyer so it also uses fixed
symmetric part numbering which should

390
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,090
confuse the attacker about the direction
of the connection and if a new

391
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:46,620
connection is initiated or not so that
the liability goes like this imagine and

392
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:52,890
investigations happens for some reason
and so it gives you the possibility to

393
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,640
answer to judge no your honor my devices
neither requested or acknowledge receipt

394
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,379
of the communication question you can
get your torrent's not acknowledge any

395
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,490
packets and say that some bad guy just
send it to your feathers

396
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:07,879
or do something you know our terms of
you 12

397
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:15,799
I says okay so the bad things here I
think bc p38 is not going the way it's

398
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,300
being slowly deployed additional
networks six that gives only statistical

399
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,230
improvement not a hundred percent
vulnerability not a hundred percent of

400
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:29,150
limiting so statistical attacks are
likely possible in addition of course

401
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:33,290
the physical attacks that i found
possible against my Krypton here in this

402
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:39,980
version for our success largely depends
on internet service providers that you

403
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:46,340
use it increases the network load but
hey we have been with the paid-for right

404
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:54,800
so these are our the tested for a large
datagram of 60 kilobytes for smaller

405
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,869
data will see a more significant
increase in the network load so if we

406
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:06,920
configure if they configure a sister to
use three sources and three this nation

407
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,660
dresses including the real one

408
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:14,750
r it would result in eight times more
natural traffic being transmitted to buy

409
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:19,490
five source IP addresses it's nine-time
increase six-by-six it's 35 times

410
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:24,890
increase starting with a by eight we can
actually use a formula to determine

411
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:30,529
increase in just two counts of source IP
addresses by the count of this nation IP

412
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:34,730
addresses multiplied so a buy it gives
64 time increase and so on hundred

413
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:43,490
hundred gives thousand times increase
the network loads so okay I think it's

414
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:48,990
finally time for the demo and we

415
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:54,959
can we get that going ok so i should
have opted for the longer cable but ok

416
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,960
he's going to have to do

417
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,100
ok so r for love you with laptops and
nothing better to do I want you to

418
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:14,089
follow this as as a hands-on if you have
two machines available with three ladies

419
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:25,010
are self somewhere on the internet so my
my github is a gift card / 0 ki three

420
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:30,950
characters 0ki arm so that I found out
yesterday that there are no real ideas

421
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:36,649
here on this network which is
unfortunate so I I scrambled to create

422
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,850
the virtual network this morning on my
laptop here but actually works for

423
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,250
internet and I tried it so

424
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:47,180
ok let's i'm going to show you going to
accept my cab

425
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,360
yeah

426
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,060
yeah

427
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:19,560
ok so i have three virtual routers 123
arm and my laptop is going to act as

428
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,200
center in one of network there and
receive another network there are you

429
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:35,069
can see the schematic here since I only
have one laptop i needed to to make a

430
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:40,260
small crack in read on Roger three are
in order for linux kernel to play ball

431
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:46,140
on the sender and receiver machine are
so sorry for that i will actually be

432
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:53,009
sending a packet 210 5757 103 will do
this nation that to the real IP address

433
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:58,800
of the receiver so don't kill me for
that but everything else is as it as it

434
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,550
should be

435
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:02,550
so let's start on the network

436
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:32,330
so if you hear her heart of Microtech
wow ok ok it's a great life and company

437
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:36,529
that makes makes great report by the way
can you hear me can you hear me market

438
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,380
ok and then on the recording to speak
like that

439
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:44,540
yeah Mike works like that ok let's
assume it does ok so let's start my

440
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,540
street routers here

441
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
yeah

442
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:00,010
and i will also set up routing on my
machine here

443
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,990
sorry for using grout into the fire out
i still come get the hang of it

444
00:42:14,049 --> 00:42:21,609
ok i will add so remember this kinetic
here i will add the default route from

445
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:26,828
this machine we can be sending from 192
168 562 those routers in here with this

446
00:42:26,829 --> 00:42:29,829
IP address

447
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:34,859
ok

448
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,480
so all we have that right

449
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:44,910
good

450
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,509
now let's take a look at the product

451
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,340
ok

452
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,830
this is from a good cup

453
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,740
now if i launched the client

454
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,450
you will need the root of course that's
one thing for server you do not need

455
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:21,259
root so I'm gonna watch server but even
even so if you have wrote i have a check

456
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:28,520
building for fake of sorry for private
night the other space so we're gonna

457
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,470
we're going to do a little bit of
editing and also represented to take a

458
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:36,470
look at the source code

459
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,240
let's get colors

460
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:17,640
ok not colorful nevermind so what we'll
do here is we would like to remove this

461
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,640
morning here as suggested by the morning
itself

462
00:44:30,289 --> 00:44:33,890
will change this nation from this
example address the 10 network diagram

463
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,750
so then 57 present . one

464
00:44:43,269 --> 00:44:46,269
and we need to create a secure key

465
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:58,720
right here

466
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,700
so i have this cool batch here let's
give a round of applause for creator

467
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:11,200
it's really good stuff so okay I'm gonna
I'm gonna take the password mode and I'm

468
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,200
gonna hope that I come up a password
here in this fit

469
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:25,488
ok write characters are we also going to
need that in the server

470
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:34,290
right permissions

471
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,829
i'm going to copy this

472
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:47,829
the server so it can understand the
packet

473
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,540
and finally in the server i usually
listen all the interfaces but it

474
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:01,320
wouldn't be fair so we want to listen
only an interface of the second simulate

475
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:12,360
love them so that is stand 5711 ok let's
try it out

476
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:21,259
so we can run the server the receiver
part as a normal user

477
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:32,320
and let's run the client as wrote
because it craps packets on low-level

478
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,040
alright

479
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:57,660
so it's a colonel screaming this again
so we gonna we need to specify a

480
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:04,770
sorceress to so since we have multiple
IP addresses on this machine we just

481
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:10,650
going to add a small pack here instead
of finding a dynamically let's specify

482
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,650
it manually

483
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,819
and let's run it again

484
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:26,288
now it worked if you guys do a poster
whenever works you can do that now

485
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:36,430
so the server actually received five
different packets of the one being sent

486
00:47:37,809 --> 00:47:44,739
I found it decrypted and found a match
and printed the data inside the payload

487
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:51,459
of 6 here starting with b which
indicates IP packet let's take a look at

488
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:54,459
where sharp

489
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,430
so we're not looking at the network of
the center

490
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,200
we can see all the others in there

491
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:37,900
and as you can see beyond layer-3 it's
identical you can see that was right and

492
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:44,320
you can also see of course that data
payload is unencrypted there if you look

493
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,970
at this we will be able to count five
times three adding 15 packets

494
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,380
right 15

495
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,380
and now let's take a look at the
receiver network

496
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,270
so

497
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:26,140
the receiver network clearly receives of
stop packing

498
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:36,569
clearly receives only the five packets
that the word this nation's matches are

499
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:43,530
so we got the statistical probability of
twenty percent of guessing the real

500
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:47,670
source IP others they're ok I can move
on back to the slide please

501
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,530
and that's not my slides

502
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,530
let's have lots of my sites

503
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,510
yeah

504
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:21,309
yeah

505
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:31,760
ok so i called the slide is coming up so
are what i would like to finish with is

506
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:39,080
the future testing and research of six
up and i would like to talk about

507
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:48,529
possible improvements to anonymity
general security and of course some

508
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:53,150
other features so it doesn't mean I will
do all that myself so I really invited

509
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:58,280
to join me arm since it doesn't 16 we
don't do not need to actually you don't

510
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,420
need to be part of a team like to join
and commitments I think I don't get help

511
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:08,630
so use your magic merge full fork

512
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:11,630
ok now we really need slides please

513
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,480
perfect around their claws

514
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:45,970
ok so for anonymity the demo of the
source code and it can actually include

515
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:49,750
commented outlines that does these
things for limiting you can cause

516
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:54,640
they're not including the real source of
even in the metadata that's even the

517
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,720
server will not be able to tell what the
client is so full deniability no logs

518
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,980
huh

519
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:05,380
you can alternatively consider not
sending the package from the real source

520
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:09,820
at all if you do both things at the same
time of course the server will not be

521
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:13,869
able to reply you but if you do any
single one of those separately server

522
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:20,530
will still be able to reply without
knowing your appearance the first and

523
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:24,580
first option here and in the second
option without highlighting European

524
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:30,190
dress at all on the network level for
search party adversary's in general

525
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:32,380
security

526
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:37,840
well there is work to be done to check
the validity of the crypt of course arm

527
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:43,330
we would need to think about key
management static shared key suck so

528
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:48,310
something has to be done about that our
penetration test is in order some

529
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:53,230
funding maybe we might think about
obvious obfuscation currently it's super

530
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:56,680
easy to detect that it seeps are you
just look at the first five bites that

531
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:01,180
has six up some other ideas

532
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,690
ipv6 of course I might actually be doing
this one myself unless someone sends a

533
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:12,050
pull request before I am able to finish
this

534
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:19,730
it's also currently already possible to
include random seed instead of the IP

535
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:24,590
map instead of the full like a map in
the metadata thus we have smaller

536
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:30,290
metadata and smaller payload oh sorry
and smaller datagram we can have

537
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,670
stateful sister

538
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:35,810
this will give a bit less bandwidth
usage but we will abandon some privacy

539
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:41,870
as it might be possible to detect when a
new connection gets created and the

540
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:49,160
night of course it's a card problem i
would say even more so than BC p38 are

541
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:54,140
so any ideas even not in not in written
form just come to me any ideas about

542
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:58,160
about having sex worker net would be
appreciated

543
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:08,690
so to conclude please please give me
feedback you can say it sucks because

544
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:10,250
there's a reason

545
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:17,210
are you can say it's great and we should
use it in products whatever plays for

546
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:21,650
implemented in real-world if you think
it's useful if you think it's saying

547
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:30,350
okay I clicked on a link because it is a
link so okay here's the link to my

548
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:41,000
github arm and here's my Twitter so yes
so that's everything from me thank you

549
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
very much

550
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:56,210
arm if there's questions and we have
some time then it's a time or feedback

551
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:59,210
already going to get Mike

552
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:12,720
yeah

553
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:20,160
hi you said something about protocol
application because every snort or bro

554
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:27,270
is going to pick up these packets
running just yesterday any kind of

555
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:28,109
sniffer

556
00:55:28,109 --> 00:55:31,230
what can be done about hiding the fact
that you're using it

557
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:35,849
well you know there are there are
multiple protocols already are being

558
00:55:35,849 --> 00:55:41,609
confiscated two are namely has had some
protocols are well as a long-standing

559
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:45,750
fun of truecrypt we could we could use
that and sent over or network so and

560
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:51,990
then see if the crypts are not of course
the the the real stretch here is active

561
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:57,450
fingerprinting is used by my great
firewall of china allegedly so well I'm

562
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:05,430
we need more smart people to to fix that
any any more questions suggestions

563
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:11,910
anybody already installed it rides
around it work okay well you have the

564
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,109
link you have the time

565
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:16,200
oh we have a question yep

566
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,900
is that the final question or do you
have any more questions okay great

567
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:29,880
if you do know the address you get
hidden behind you to hide not into you

568
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:34,859
reach revocable if you include the
address where you're going to be

569
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:40,290
hydrated behind in the the list of the
aps sorry Kenny can you repeat that

570
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:46,950
again baby microphone bit further from
you mentioned that it doesn't work with

571
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:47,879
height not

572
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:54,990
yes reason probably because you include
your original IP address in the list of

573
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:59,220
the IP addresses but later on it gets
changed to another one that you don't

574
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:03,779
know we hand but if you do know that
you're going to be highlighted you could

575
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:10,320
easily the exchange your true IP to the
one to be knotted right okay III get it

576
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:14,700
yet so are in in one version of the
protocol in theoretical version of the

577
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,250
protocol you can actually not include
your real source of the others at all

578
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:22,800
and work the problem is that is that
your local router will translate all the

579
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,090
addresses the same output address and
you

580
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:29,380
do not have control over that and you
will all their packets will come out

581
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,770
with a real interfacing address

582
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:37,780
ok so I see there are no more questions
so thank you so much for joining me and

583
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:38,470
have a great conference
