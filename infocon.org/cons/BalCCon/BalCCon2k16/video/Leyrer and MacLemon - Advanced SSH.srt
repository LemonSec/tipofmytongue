1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:22,650
my favorite lectures here

2
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:37,410
Cyril and make a lemon will be holding
the lecture called advanced ssh welcome

3
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,629
if you have been to a previous lectures
are we switched a few things around just

4
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:48,270
to confuse you so on your left this time
is make lemon I and to your right is

5
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,440
lighter

6
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:59,790
hi we think we should be talking about
advanced ssh for several values of

7
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:05,339
advanced that was a topic for heated
discussion on Twitter and in added some

8
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:12,539
other conference what what is actually
advance and some people that the opinion

9
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,510
stiffer tramadol whoo yeah yeah they
converted the difference immediately so

10
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:24,180
we'll start with a quick overview of
what will be not covering so if you're

11
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,049
interested in those you're in the wrong
talk or friend who's interested in those

12
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:28,920
things

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,430
yeah they're not here anyway so we'll
focus and openssh arm because we expect

14
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,820
this is what most of you will be using
anyway arm if you're losing an open

15
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:50,520
solaris version of ssh the idea and
install openssh on solaris as well so we

16
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:57,270
won't be covering the . ssh config file
which you already are using I expect

17
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:03,990
will not go into depth with that will
use but not go into that in public key

18
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,920
authentication you're already using that
i'm pretty sure if you're interesting

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,849
advanced ssh things so you have ed to
5519 RSA keys in use to prevent

20
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:16,200
successful months

21
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,190
in the middle attacks or brute force
attacks to your servers you maybe have

22
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,480
already heard of port forwarding local
forwarding remote forwarding x11

23
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,890
forwarding and dynamic for weddings for
socks proxy on the fly and you already

24
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:35,369
know how to copy files back and forth
using CPR SFTP or if you so desire our

25
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:42,390
sink and you truly are familiar with the
standard towel rainbow pipe compression

26
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,869
type you which gives you not only a nice
rainbow but also a nice progress bar and

27
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:55,140
how faster copies going and of course
the standard ssh speed test how fast

28
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,690
your pipes are working so um if you're
still with us

29
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,440
that's fine if not stay it will be at
least entertaining

30
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,260
that's what you said yet um the things
we show you are a few things we use in

31
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,179
our daily work as a bastard operated
from hell and of course everything is

32
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,890
nineteen eleven percent certified as
works on my machine as you

33
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:32,179
so on interested in shaker year
configurations for your ssh client and

34
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,340
server of course some there's a bunch of
things you can do and you probably never

35
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,920
looked into this or you have hopefully
you should use probably happen if you're

36
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,328
not make lemon you haven't looked at
this something and at least after this

37
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,879
talk to you will of course

38
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:55,939
SSH uses some key exchange algorithms to
establish the connection the conflict

39
00:03:55,939 --> 00:04:02,120
keeper is X algorithms and if you don't
know which algorithms your ssh client

40
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:11,419
supports you can ask it cash capital Q X
and you record this requires ssh 6.3 and

41
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:17,299
higher are and you get a friendly list
of key exchange algorithms this is the

42
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:22,190
current version 7.3 of openssh what it
does support there's a bunch of things

43
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,690
and to know what you can configure what
you should configure from my point of

44
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:33,080
view will drill down that list a little
so there's a few things ending in sha-1

45
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,159
of course we should not be using shall
one anymore and it probably won't

46
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:44,389
survive this year so we'll cross those
out arm the diffie-hellman groups our

47
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:52,729
group 14 by Crips it's a 2048-bit group
the higher groups a larger anything less

48
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:59,599
than that we strike out of course and

49
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:10,960
yes we get rid of those if you don't
like the mist elliptic curve because you

50
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,799
don't like mist or you don't trust miss
you can get rid of those as well and any

51
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:25,150
hash function that is below char 384 is
also not recommended to be used anymore

52
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,950
so shaft 256 if you want to go
high-security get rid of those as well

53
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:36,550
and if you but for me personally I think
it's fine to go with shot . 256 that's

54
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,460
still ok and if you leave in the
diffie-hellman group exchange he

55
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,469
exchanged algorithm you gotta edit your
ssh model file which is a bunch of

56
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,450
crimes that your client and the server
uses to connect and it looks like this

57
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:57,280
of course it's much larger and you could
even see less of that there's no need to

58
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,299
take pictures of the Model T there on
your system as well too

59
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,450
that's fine if we zoom into this to get
a nice States them form when that file

60
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:15,039
is and the fifth column shows you the
bit size of the primes anything below

61
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,560
2000 bits you should get rid of you can
just comment that out the current

62
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:29,230
openssh 6 . all current openbsd 6
release which uses openssh 67.3 has

63
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:36,220
everything removed below 2047 so that's
something you need to edit on the server

64
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,980
and the client both have to agree on
these common primes so for configuring

65
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:48,850
you will end up with this case algorithm
list in that order of course the curve

66
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:59,380
to 5519 is the Daniel Burnstein curve
it's really fast to use its safe curve

67
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,630
and the other ones as a fallback
depending on what your server or Wi-Fi

68
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:10,120
LED bulb or your toaster supports this
is how you enter this in your ssh

69
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,050
conflict final the client you have the
host star which is your generic

70
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,179
configuration that applies to all your
host entries there and you just put that

71
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:27,260
in on a single line that's fine you can
use the same configuration your ssh the

72
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:34,070
conflict file on the server just without
the host start line don't but just just

73
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,599
make sure that all clients that will
connect that server will support all of

74
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,210
at least one of those yeah you will
notice when you don't agree on things it

75
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:50,270
will just not work anymore so take care
before you reload is HD server before

76
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,450
you lock is also of course there's key
types

77
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:59,659
these are used by the client to
authenticate the server and check the

78
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:06,260
fingerprints and of course they have to
be mutually supported you can again if

79
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:12,680
you run an ssh 6.3 and above you can ask
your client what it does support course

80
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,590
there's a bunch again now of course we
don't want to use DSS which is a esa

81
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:25,520
version or elliptic curve DSA versions
anymore so we strike those out that was

82
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,270
easy and you'll end up with a pipe key
accepted key types configuration line

83
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:41,120
will gladly accept ed2 5519 elliptic
curve keys from the server in sight

84
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,740
versions with a certificate or just as a
host key as I guess most of you won't be

85
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:53,300
running their own pki planet your
fallback we use our essay which is the

86
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,790
most commonly used still armed

87
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:02,630
if you can get rid of our say go the
easy to 5519 it's quite simple for

88
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:09,860
message authentication that guarantees
your integrity of the messages there's

89
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,589
also multiple versions of those already
in sounds familiar looking good

90
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:21,320
if you're on older versions you can get
them as well it's not that funny on but

91
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,430
it works it gives you the same list we
can also thrilled that down again within

92
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,339
the same manner we don't want to use
show one

93
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:34,819
496 be shortened versions of char one or
md5 will get rid of those we don't want

94
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:41,990
to use anything that use this version
other than encrypt then Mac so first we

95
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,519
encrypt and then we get a message
authentication digest we get rid of

96
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:54,290
those everything below 128 bits is right
out and we end up with this list of Max

97
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,759
sorted by strength

98
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,779
there's no need to remove anything
that's not that strong because there's

99
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:04,670
no downgrade attacks available so you
can happily just use that one of course

100
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,170
after all that authentication and
agreement we end up with the symmetric

101
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:16,639
cipher that we actually use for our
encryption of the stream you can ask ssh

102
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:22,220
what it does support there's teleton
again already know the drill

103
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:27,920
we get rid of everything that uses only
64-bit blocks which is triple des slow

104
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:37,939
fish its cost we get rid of those
therefrom 1976 almost as old as me of

105
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:41,719
course we can't read yourself talk for
yourself yeah we get rid of everything

106
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:49,160
that uses cipher block chaining mode CBC
mode and rc4 we all know that that is

107
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,850
broken and we get rid of those as well
with with blood and let me just that

108
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:58,040
with Blowfish if you searched the
googles are you will you will find our

109
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,189
introductions on how to make x11
forwarding faster and one of the one of

110
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:10,399
the tips you will find on Google a lot
is restricted cyprus to blow fish or

111
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,660
something similar

112
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,870
these are all old guides please don't do
that anymore

113
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:21,860
ya won't work yeah your performance will
be fine trust our raw fish is a cipher

114
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:28,040
create originally created by shania and
he himself recommends to not use his

115
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,259
cipher anymore because it's old and
broken should give you a hint

116
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:40,759
yeah so you end up with a sigh
first-string the chapter 20 Polly 1305

117
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,400
visit

118
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:50,400
a new cipher supports and so is HSN 6.4
465 it's a very fast cipher it also

119
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,140
works well on machines that do not have
a is hardware instructions like the S&I

120
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,660
instruction set on until chips

121
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:04,140
it's extremely fast on arm so if you're
on your phone or just a small embedded

122
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:10,560
port that are pretty common these days
or thunder x96 core arm monster

123
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,390
this is really fast so don't worry about
your performance and the other ones is

124
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:22,770
in our account immodest GM and counter
mode CTR also sorted by strength if you

125
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:27,569
only want to use the so-called
authenticated encryption with associated

126
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,020
data which means it doesn't need an
additional mac for message

127
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:37,890
authentication you could get a short
list by cipher off which means you'll

128
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,000
end up with just the GCM modes and chat
when you probably 1305 course these are

129
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,290
in the order

130
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,709
SSH gives them to you and not the one
you should configure take that from the

131
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,010
other one still with me

132
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:55,290
yeah that's a lot i know you'll get the
slides you can copy paste from there

133
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:01,050
just don't let yourselves out onto more
funny things entertaining this is

134
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:06,300
security self i know it's it's tedious
but it helps anyone using two-factor

135
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,630
authentication as a bunch

136
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:16,350
ok for ssh login is H logins let's let
it still one okay that's great

137
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:24,360
um to factor that's nice um that's how
your users can authenticate against the

138
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,440
server as well

139
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,010
public key authentication is fine but
you cannot meant that with the second

140
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,180
factor

141
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,520
first you can buy RSA tokens they're
pretty expensive they use some strange

142
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,170
random number generators that are
probably not that random they're

143
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:45,270
inconvenient to carry around people tend
to forget them to drop them to lose them

144
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:51,510
there's creative ways to get around that
so it if you lose your RSA tokens don't

145
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,490
carry them with you

146
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:58,970
put them somewhere safe flip up a camera
our picture quality these days is fine

147
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,350
enough for computer vision to actually
read the numbers and if you need more

148
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,220
than one

149
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:11,660
yeah stick it to a cardboard ok if you
need more examples a trisexual shoulder

150
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,880
and you will find quite a few of those
tokens

151
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:20,570
yeah so fuck find your friendly weapon
and see what happens

152
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:26,209
of course generically RSA tokens are
just a time-based one-time pads which

153
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:32,390
means there's a pseudo-random function
initialization initialized with the seat

154
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:37,850
random value and every 30 seconds it
changes the value that you need one of

155
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,290
what what what he actually means is
there is a net for that there's an app

156
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:47,240
for that there's probably multiple one
of those apps with a standardized method

157
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,660
of calculating these things Google
Authenticator if you don't like Google

158
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,279
there's other apps that implement the
same algorithm you can easily get that

159
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:02,209
for free and so SD a time-based you
don't need don't need any internet

160
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:06,260
connection you have to use that which is
quite convenient if you're in the data

161
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,550
center and your phone does not have
internet reception there because of

162
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:17,990
level- 3gs n gets really bad you can use
that in flight mode that works just fine

163
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:25,880
installation is even simpler at least of
demon on TBN many ppl flavored sucks

164
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,399
that is easy if you prefer the bees
these like me there's two reports you

165
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,820
can install some assistance

166
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:43,160
yep that works just as well and now you
need to tell ssh that it somehow has to

167
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,630
react to two-factor coats this is really
really hard stuff it takes you have at

168
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,630
least a whole weekend configure trust me

169
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:56,020
yeah because yeah just want to hold
their both days at the conference

170
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,310
talking to people instead of working on
you or explore trying to exit them so

171
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:06,130
yes so what you actually have to do is
you have to edit your assets sshd config

172
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:12,400
file for PMD and add an additional line
arm telling penalty that we are using

173
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,770
the google authenticator module are at
the beginning you will probably want to

174
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:25,960
add an additional parameter to to tell
it to arm arm which is called now

175
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,240
located which tells them to ignore any
errors with the Ponte module until you

176
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:38,530
have all the users on on the google cool
token or to google application so to say

177
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,530
yeah so that's one that's the one
configurations adding one line it's

178
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,150
really really hard work

179
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:47,290
so yeah build a customer eight hours at
least

180
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,099
yeah everything during the weekend
preferably restaurant with my

181
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:58,000
double-time second configuration is of
course the sshd config what you need at

182
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,160
least is the challenge response
authentication turned onto yes otherwise

183
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,329
it won't work

184
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:10,930
arm the other stuff is basically if you
know that it works and and and you don't

185
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:16,000
lock yourself for yourself out again so
you have set up your public/private key

186
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,869
authentication you're sure you can still
access the machine once your enable our

187
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:27,129
two-factor authentication but because
with that you can't log in without the

188
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,930
second factor so this is what you have
in your conflict after everything works

189
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,410
and you have double check that it
actually does do not do this before

190
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,790
setting up google authenticator just
coming

191
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:43,659
you're responsible admin so yeah we just
reminding you of the baton of the best

192
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,650
practices

193
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,850
exactly and to initialize school
authenticator in your terminal for

194
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,980
specific user login as that user and
she's just run Google Authenticator and

195
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,490
for this we will switch to the top down

196
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:08,530
live demo so who's typing should i type
of track please type so we're just

197
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:13,240
starting google authenticator and who
google authenticator that the clients at

198
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,390
the program will ask us a few questions
and we'll generate us a key that we have

199
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:24,550
to enter into the application to to
synchronize a to synchronize those two

200
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:30,190
elements we have something prepared for
this over the years but it's ok so let's

201
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,050
let's just start the google
authenticator and it asks do you want to

202
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,889
use our authentication tokens based on
time

203
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:45,280
yes because we're Time Lords and then it
creates a whole bunch of gibberish arm

204
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,100
and the music secret key which you
haven't seen i will have to put things

205
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:56,169
you afterwards and of course there's the
emergency scratch codes arm

206
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:01,390
no don't scratch on the screen are these
are just called that way

207
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:06,160
are these are your emergency codes in
case your phone gets lost you can't use

208
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,980
the synchronized google authenticator
again with that you can arm

209
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,559
what's about rescue rescue setup and and
login again you can use these codes to

210
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:22,960
login even without your phone so have
these ready in case your phone gets

211
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,750
stolen lost caught in a fire

212
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:31,690
whatever are you have a few more plugins
to use Soviet can at least reset up we

213
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,840
authenticate or get new tokens or turn
it off

214
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,419
should I mean necessary student at
school so the next question is do you

215
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,260
want to update your google authenticator
file or create a google authenticator

216
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,920
file this is the configuration file that
gets written into your home directory

217
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:53,170
and which will which depending model
will use to verify the code so we will

218
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:59,230
say yes in this case because we want to
show that it actually works arm do you

219
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,530
want to disallow multiple users of the
same authentication token as we are

220
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:07,559
demoing at the moment we just say no yes
a wrestler

221
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,249
do you want to do is this allow so we
allow multiple users

222
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:21,418
yes and there's also if if you're our
time servers are not that current you

223
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:29,340
can ask you around with the with the
timing we do want this as well and two

224
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,970
hardened against brute force attempts we
can enable rate-limiting which we want

225
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,240
to at this moment so that's all done

226
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,679
are we are we are basically done with to
set up on the so-called client-side I

227
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,619
all we have to do is now our tell deem
our application on the on the cellphone

228
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:54,209
arm the secret key we have seen before
so that our will manage to get that we

229
00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:00,360
know there are what you can see here is
the screen of the phone and you have the

230
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:07,498
authenticator icon we can launch it and
we're really done that before

231
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:15,059
nope it says welcome you want to set up
two factor authentication yes we want i

232
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:20,249
would say begin setup and then you have
two ways of setting that up and to show

233
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:27,779
you which way these work i have to
switch over here get rid of that one and

234
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:36,419
we're using teammates the general so i
can scroll back on course if we have the

235
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:42,690
secret key is a code you can type that's
rather inconvenient and slow and course

236
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:47,039
you probably will make a typo but you
get also a QR code generated your

237
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:55,740
terminal that's convenient probably only
so sensible use of QR codes anywhere and

238
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:04,919
i can just say scan barcode and go here
and it should scan the barcode app and

239
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:05,730
I'm all set

240
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:13,019
this is it's really that simple and now
you see SH host or one that's the one we

241
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:18,000
name of the host we use when it starts
blinking red you only have a few seconds

242
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,680
left to use that code and

243
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,250
it generates a new one the small
indicator on the right shows you how

244
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,630
long you have until the next code
appears and of course you can rename

245
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:32,820
those because if you have the 27th ssh
holes there you won't know which one to

246
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,629
use

247
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:37,920
so this is available and so basically
what you also see that this tool forces

248
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,690
you to use a code for each server
separate code so you can sort them

249
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:48,810
around the ones you use more often there
are you can sort them if you so please

250
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,010
alright so let's show you how this works

251
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,890
can you switch back to the other
terminal i can switch back to the other

252
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:03,000
terminal and this and this and work back
here for a so i'm going to scroll down

253
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,440
as well with iron and quick but it might
cause this museum

254
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:15,870
alright yeah so are here we are here we
are so let's look out of the machine

255
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:22,770
again so impact on my on my workstation
and now I try to login again so I'm

256
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,770
doing an ssh host one

257
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:32,070
okay give me a second because I prepared
something else for later and

258
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:48,360
something that's try again so i have so
i told arm ssh2 not use and a key file

259
00:23:48,360 --> 00:24:00,149
and we should get the normal username
password prompt are no mm then this is

260
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:10,260
agent the equipment entertain them of
course with every log in on the cell you

261
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,700
should have a fortune or cow say it's a
cultural thing every server should have

262
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:21,000
that mission critical and it also helps
to keep people entertained while Martin

263
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,630
is typing desperately trying to get rid
of SH agent but you also reduce its not

264
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:33,660
make a note of that Sh is awesome
killing spree

265
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:40,760
ok let's let's try again

266
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:46,310
yeah lot better so we're not connected
to the server and it prompted for a

267
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:52,100
password which we will enter and it now
ask for the verification could could you

268
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:59,959
please show me the verification code
which is 0 for 4 190 and I'm locked in

269
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:05,270
so that's two factor authentication
takes takes at least three days with the

270
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,620
field to the customer

271
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:11,330
tell your boss I need three days to set
this up and in a week to set it up for

272
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,020
it all pays because you're not buying
RSA token so it's a really cheap

273
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,830
solution

274
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:23,210
yeah you can also combine this with that
with key exchange you can have a key

275
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:28,190
authentication combined with her with
the time-based factor authentication but

276
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,940
usually you do it as a fallback for your
your been username password

277
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,870
authentication to apartment that with a
with a second factor

278
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,770
yeah you can pretty much mix-and-match
multiple types of authentication like

279
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:47,930
password interactive plus authentication
token or just an ssh key that's also

280
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,780
possible so you have a fallback method
if you cannot access your keys you can

281
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,930
still log in with a password but then
you need a second factor

282
00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:02,990
alright yeah except so arm onto the next
our topic and I should we switch over to

283
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:08,570
the slide sort of just staying within
the condition of the slide would just

284
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,290
show you

285
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:14,210
Bastian hosts which means you have over
one host to another host and that's

286
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:21,710
about the slide so that's that's one of
things at least Isis that men have to

287
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:25,910
quite often our customers or even
internal our department set up a

288
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:31,040
so-called bastion host or fireball of
new name it whatever you want so you

289
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,200
have to connect r2d2 the first server
and from then on you can then hop into a

290
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,340
server that is within the firewall
within the local area network of your

291
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,820
customer or your are

292
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:49,919
the company so that the the part of one
way to do that would be to SSH into the

293
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:58,620
first toast that we just this is worse

294
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,620
you should have set up key
authentication

295
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,450
yeah

296
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,070
turn turn

297
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:25,590
oops what's going on that just ask for
the key password passphrase nope city

298
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,930
hmm

299
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,740
turn the little lobby as well

300
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:53,160
download google the arm bar on don't
want this age don't pressure me it's

301
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,930
just a hundred people looking

302
00:27:54,930 --> 00:28:03,210
yeah NORs so fine they're fighting
they're still friendly now we ok so i

303
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,620
connect to the first two first server my
question host and then from then on I

304
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,770
will connect to my second toast

305
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:20,040
you're too taut example.com and I
haven't set up the key stare so login

306
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,990
with username and password and I'm now
on my on my second machine

307
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,640
yeah on my second machine so that's it
that's the normal our manual way to do

308
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,970
this this is rather boring this is
cumbersome if you have to do that

309
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:37,980
several times a day this is really
really really boring arm

310
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:46,410
the nice thing is that with the most
current version of SSH SSH officers a

311
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:52,290
nice new option called jump post armed
with which our proxy jump we will which

312
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:57,870
will simplify this our activity
enormously so you just give it the

313
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:03,540
option minus J and the name of the best
of the foot of the first or of all the

314
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:08,520
best of all the time posts you want and
that's the last document the target

315
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,780
server you actually want to connect to
and what is H will do that please also

316
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:19,560
ssh is going to make you jump down on
Jump bad 90 songs for 500 yes

317
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:25,539
so you can not only jump from one host
but for several host until you reach

318
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:27,100
your destination

319
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,889
so if everything works as expected this
should connect us directly to the host

320
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:38,710
number two and it actually does as you
can see in the in the bottom corner

321
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:44,500
under the last line of the shell so it's
easy it's fast i don't have don't have

322
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:51,789
to type that much arm and if I exit that
connection it will it will tell me arm

323
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:57,520
that the connection to host 02 arm has
been closed so I don't even see how many

324
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,158
armed how many hosts I i jump through to
get to my final destination of the

325
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:09,610
finalists no no no no of course this can
be even even I'm now with I mean we're

326
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:14,918
still playing shr golf so we can even
shot we can shorten that even more and

327
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:21,159
just say for example proxy champ and it
will do the same thing what I've done

328
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:30,190
here is a I've made an entry in the ssh
conflict file for the proxy jump arm

329
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:35,799
giving it the hostname at the user image
it is the identity file should use and

330
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:40,389
of course the proxy jump our statement
giving the that the question house I

331
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:45,909
want to connect through and the host
here one is the entry up here are also

332
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:54,340
specifying an empty file you support and
post them armed so this is only

333
00:30:54,340 --> 00:31:02,020
available with ssh 7.3 if you're older
versions or slightly all the versions

334
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:07,779
nobody uses older versions of openssh
I'm sure yeah I'm for those that still

335
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:14,020
have to struggle with those arm there is
something called sshs standard i/o

336
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:20,470
forwarding or minus minus W that will
bounce you through to the fruity to

337
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:25,539
media toast to your destination and will
basically for what the standard i/o arm

338
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:32,090
our channels to your client so the
comment is a little bit of

339
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:36,980
more cumbersome and there's a proximal
month which basically tells that user

340
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:44,330
the ssh connection to host one two punch
through to the destination sh 0 0 to

341
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:51,710
this should work as well it did in the
morning again I'm connected to a host to

342
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:57,169
as you can see in the bottom are the
bottom line syntax is a little bit more

343
00:31:57,169 --> 00:32:02,240
explicit but still works works quite
fine I'm of course you can use the proxy

344
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,049
command part you've seen here enter
directly on the command line you can put

345
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,450
that on your ssh conflict as well

346
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:14,750
you mean like this yeah exactly why
you're so prepared sorry for that

347
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:20,360
so again are playing ssh golf SHP see
our gets us the same at the same result

348
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:26,630
I'm if you if you don't even have
standard i/o for warding which some SH

349
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:33,710
clients are do do not support our
there's a that you can force a TTYL at

350
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:40,340
TT what a TTYL location arm which will
basically do the same thing as 2

351
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:47,990
standard i/o forwarding arm instead of
minus W it's minus TT and armed with

352
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,799
this you don't get you don't get the
authentication forwarding you just get

353
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:57,139
you just get the login prompt and then
you're also locked in on our host to you

354
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:02,299
see that's one of the best one drawback
on for this method and with this message

355
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:06,289
method as well I'll see all the
connections that actually get open so

356
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:11,450
it's a ssh host one as well as this age
host to as you can see in the bottom

357
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:19,070
lines arm if your host is even all the
which means means means she Sean Connery

358
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:26,149
mode on which means ssh 53 or lower so
we're really talking about ancient

359
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:30,709
softer by now and we don't have TTYL
forwarding you don't have a standard all

360
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:37,429
forwarding you don't have minus J are
what you need is a net cut and you can

361
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:42,500
then use net cup as a proxy to proxy
fruit to the Buddha

362
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:51,140
bastion host to the destination host and
again are you are connected to ssh host

363
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:56,210
to works as well and of course there's
also the possibility put to put this

364
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:01,160
into the ssh conflict file so by now you
have realized you should really upgrade

365
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:09,020
to openssh 7.3 for many reasons that the
at the the minus J option alone is worth

366
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:15,320
is this worth the upgrade is just the
thing I'm the thing is that there's also

367
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,840
a thing that most used only around
called ssh agent for wanting to forward

368
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:26,240
the arm authentication that the the
private key to through the question host

369
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,069
to other question who sent to the target
server you don't want to use that

370
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:37,129
anymore there are attacks for that are
if you're still using ssh and forwarding

371
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:42,980
please turn that off and switch to more
secure authentication measurements

372
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:52,250
yep and if any questions on this quick
one yes but wait a second from my place

373
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:57,740
I've been rather fast i know sorry for
that on the first proxy connection you

374
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,399
did it didn't ask for the host to
password

375
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,700
why are because the forwarding forwarded
the tunnels one ssh connection through

376
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:13,490
the other so are an end and just start
at your local pc so it connects to the

377
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:18,859
first to the first question server
connects through with the private

378
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,970
certificate does the normal of
authentication and then it started it

379
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:26,930
tunnels through the second connection
from your client of all through and

380
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,109
replied and users clearly here's a
purely for what the

381
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:33,800
okay thank you so you're directly
connecting through an ssh tunnel with an

382
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,720
ssh tunnel vision is an internal yeah
you can you can multiply those keep in

383
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,250
mind if you're going like 16 hops that
way a single bite will give you 200

384
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:49,340
megabytes of traffic so you may want to
keep that number at a reasonable count

385
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:55,220
second second one and then we'll yep
lovely option- J so let's say only one

386
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:55,810
of the hole

387
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:59,980
just as your private key because the
Republican it the other three ask you

388
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,970
for a password car would look it don't
just prompted for the password each one

389
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:04,330
of them

390
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:11,799
yeah right okay okay okay

391
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:25,960
how much time do we have so what is we
still have 20 minutes but way too fast

392
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,760
yeah key authentication is just too fast
yeah we should have met what went 4-4

393
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,930
slower

394
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:36,190
yeah he change algorithms that take more
time than what it should have he should

395
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:43,780
we should have used austin bedrooms 2
demo probably I ok so what's next on our

396
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:48,430
list what's what's next door on the last
applause yeah you have now you've seen

397
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:54,790
best host some also quite conveniently
and a few other mice funny things you

398
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:59,920
can add to your client conflict for
example there's been a rather unpleasant

399
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:10,540
discovery with ssh 5.4 27.1 including
with an undocumented feature of the ssh

400
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:18,700
client which ended up with two CD East
allowing a an attacking host to steal

401
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,970
key material from a client would just
rather not nice

402
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:26,589
it was fixed in seven 17.1 Pete to pitch
level two

403
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:33,520
yep it's an undocumented configuration
option called use roaming you want to

404
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,750
set that to know on your client it's not
valid for the service you don't need

405
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:42,940
there but if you're not on a recent
client version of openssh just put that

406
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:51,220
into your general conflict to prevent
any attacks from Roke server malicious

407
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,430
service to your client service are not
affected by this

408
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:58,419
of course if you can upgrade your
openssh it's even better it doesn't hurt

409
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:04,360
on more modern versions of course if you
tweak a lot with your key exchange

410
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,360
algorithms like we've seen before and
youre ciphers

411
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:14,200
you might find that some things are not
working as expected of course we always

412
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:20,439
expect things not to work this is why we
have a strategy for debugging things we

413
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,330
don't have a strategy know we have
debugging up at least we have a problem

414
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:31,810
to play with yeah so if you don't are
you not sure if your ssh conflict

415
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:36,490
options are actually sticking and if
there's the right order of them in your

416
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:43,660
contract file you can use ssh minus
capital g I have no idea what that

417
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,660
stands for but it's good

418
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:54,310
configure good probably here and this
will help you to see which conflict

419
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:58,930
options actually apply to that specific
connection so it will combine everything

420
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:08,350
from the global etcs sh config file to
your . sssh config file your hosts

421
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:13,299
asterisk entries which apply to all
hosts connections and of course your

422
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:18,430
specific hosts this is my beautiful
server hosts are all those combined

423
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:24,580
you'll end up with a long list of
options are that you can see and this is

424
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,970
how you find out if your conflict
probably has a problem with with

425
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:34,089
ordering a sorting to see that we want
to show that not you don't want to show

426
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:38,740
it you can imagine it's a lot of inertia
of course if that doesn't help when

427
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,870
you're sure what my conflicts actually
fine

428
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:49,420
you surely have already used sh sh small
fee for service mode and the paucity can

429
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:55,210
go up to triple B which is very very
bubbles it gives you a lot of debug

430
00:39:55,210 --> 00:40:00,100
output but with those two you should
actually be fine with finding any

431
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:06,279
problem that arises when connecting with
a client to a certain host of course

432
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,960
you're lucky when you only have to deal
with openssh I've heard they're on the

433
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,740
other

434
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,189
SSH clients out there and even
proprietary servers

435
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:20,910
there is a fuse given just one check one
more second arm you can of course use

436
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:29,430
our sh- triple br2 2d park are the
connection but you might want to use a

437
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,980
pink beforehand or something

438
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:37,200
I mean you can use a triple B to D park
that you're not having any network

439
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,038
connection at all but it's usually
faster to just ping before you do a

440
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,599
trickle-down ssh like like the usual
network cable without the clip that has

441
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,990
just slightly you mean the left out a
report

442
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:54,419
HP switch special switch cable yeah
special laptop safety cable when

443
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,200
somebody trips over just falls out
instead of grabbing your laptop as well

444
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:03,390
sorry I interrupted you regarding a
legacy systems look at her legacy

445
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:09,720
systems does any one of you will use
legacy systems Windows that's not a

446
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,009
better system computer systems that's
like I see

447
00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:18,900
yep but even on Windows 10 you can now
have the open to subsystem which is

448
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,900
probably only 12 without system t so

449
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,050
well yeah you probably have each
probably any one of us has this old

450
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:37,480
solaris box somewhere or hp-ux or next
step or iris iris hi Barry weeks and

451
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,830
reselling unravel yeah

452
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:47,049
anyone using silicon graphics still not
even the machine has won every that

453
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:52,150
there's ways to deal with legacy systems
without messing up your whole country

454
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:57,490
because you can just make a country
entering your in your contract file for

455
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:05,140
host vintage box and you don't have to
write out all the bad stuff that this

456
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:10,270
box support because somebody actually
might update that box at some point so

457
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:16,750
there's a nice conflict option where you
can add a specific type for key a key

458
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:20,770
exchange algorithms to your general
conflict by just pretending it with a

459
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:27,220
plus so if you had those three lines for
any connection with the vintage box you

460
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:34,060
will also support diffie-hellman groups
are one and tripled a CBC mode for

461
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:38,710
encryption without having to change your
general configure your only allowing

462
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:43,840
that one should some better options
apply at the moment so this is a nice

463
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:50,440
way to get back on track within the
vintage box without having to mess up

464
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:57,250
anything else right so that the thing
would move this talk of is that we've

465
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:02,170
been unsure on what really qualifies for
advanced ssh what i have shown you so

466
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:08,440
far are things that the general
population we asked hundreds that means

467
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,370
perfectly

468
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:15,279
what-what-what advanced means and this
is what we came up with as yes this

469
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:21,130
advanced this mean there are few obscure
things like okay I want to use kerberos

470
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:25,330
and stuff like that but that was the
general but we have shown you so far the

471
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:29,470
general agreement on what advanced ssh
means so

472
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:35,430
we are a little bit ahead of time
unfortunately I'm so we would switch it

473
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:41,220
over to questions and if you have any
questions regarding is a jewel will be

474
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,879
happy to answer them now or at least
we'll try

475
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,980
yeah otherwise grabbers afterwards that
with a beer and then we'll happy show

476
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,569
you the things we skipped over with the
conflict file and pop private-public he

477
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:58,799
just like that if you approach with a
beer maybe try to be the first one with

478
00:43:58,799 --> 00:44:03,089
the beer and not the seventh because I i
would not take any ssh advice from

479
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:09,749
myself after seven years of questions do
we have a microphone we do have a

480
00:44:09,749 --> 00:44:13,828
microphone so make yourself knowledge or
not noticeable

481
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,470
you can also ask questions for naps and
friends if you don't want to ask

482
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:26,819
yourself so about challenge-response you
showed how you can implement Google

483
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:32,549
Authenticator some RS aid and time-based
thing suppose I or a friend wanted

484
00:44:32,549 --> 00:44:34,319
something simpler

485
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:40,319
so just the challenge that where the
response is calculated in somebody's

486
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,808
head right so let's let's say super
simple example it shows me 10 letters I

487
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:48,569
should respond with the fifth of those
letters

488
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:51,180
how difficult is it to implement
something like that do you have to write

489
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:55,529
a pump module or how would you do it it
it's easy right a parametric module yes

490
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,680
yeah but getting a panel of that
complexity is probably just a few lines

491
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,799
of whatever programming language you
like so that should not be too hard i

492
00:45:07,799 --> 00:45:10,739
probably search on get up for something
like that

493
00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:14,279
searching for merely an absent friend
has already written something that you

494
00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:17,279
can use or at least easily patch to your
liking

495
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:27,770
Oh over quickly becoming the first round
little more

496
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:35,360
yeah okay so Google Authenticator seems
cool sounds heard of it before somehow

497
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:40,430
ok so are so too stupid questions about
it do you need to have a google account

498
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:44,629
that's one and the second one you have
to agree to google license agreement the

499
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:54,350
one that says you are capable of selling
your data to use it if we have is if you

500
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:59,480
have a stock android phone are you will
you have probably include several times

501
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:04,970
to the google armed license agreements
and and and stuff like that are for

502
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:08,779
operation of the tool you don't need any
network connection there is no there is

503
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,130
no date to transmitted neither from the
application or from north from your

504
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:18,410
server so it's really just coated
generates this number it's not that

505
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,299
really not that hard

506
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,710
yeah also the the algorithm used is
standardized so you don't have to use

507
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:28,250
the it's just a commonly known phrase
google authenticator

508
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:33,290
there's many other applications that
implement the same algorithm so you

509
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:37,400
don't have to use the one from google
just happens to be available free on iOS

510
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,930
on Android and other phones that the
algorithm itself is RFC the thing I

511
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:47,990
think it's RFC dia and for example if
you use an iphone like me there's also

512
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:52,549
one password which implements the same
method and you don't need a google or

513
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:56,420
account for this you don't need a
network connection don't need to go in

514
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,740
connection or anything

515
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,890
what we've shown you here with scanning
the cold that's actually from the

516
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:05,299
initial launch of the application we're
greeted with the welcome screen so use

517
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:10,670
whatever application you prefer there's
probably some open source of things I

518
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:11,570
destroyed

519
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:16,010
let's just do the same so yeah

520
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:23,910
is there any symmetric algorithm strong
enough against computers

521
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:31,830
well I lost you after strong enough for
Dramamine resistant to quantum computers

522
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:39,029
are symmetric algorithms are actually
not as symmetric as a material i don't

523
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:47,610
know of any implemented post quantum key
exchange algorithms like x2 5519 or

524
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:53,190
something like that at least not in
openssh yet they're probably being added

525
00:47:53,190 --> 00:48:01,740
at some point but not at this moment I
follow-up do we allow find just the

526
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:07,979
additional question what do you think
about and through algorithm I didn't

527
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:20,040
extend through Andrew and Pru yes this
is ok for it thanks sorry

528
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:29,520
come come to us after the top please
yeah yeah yeahs question regarding the

529
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,180
google authenticator would be possible
to change load them so we would actually

530
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:37,319
need more than one device to actually
give access to a machine and similar to

531
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,980
launching nuclear missiles where you
have two people that actually have to

532
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,950
turn the key at the same time

533
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:51,439
at least I haven't tried you basically
can't marry if it if you build if you

534
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,490
build if you built the the parameter .
module by yourself you could just rename

535
00:48:55,490 --> 00:49:01,160
it and yeah should work ok thank you
probably have to just patch the the

536
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,299
final name that Google Authenticator
looks for in your own directory and if

537
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:10,130
you add multiple of those that approach
should probably give you what you need

538
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:11,540
to launch codes

539
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,540
thank you

540
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:21,230
any more questions and if anything it we
missed anything you you think is it once

541
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:29,990
and we we skipped so we know what to
prepare for next year as I thought we

542
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:33,529
were doing kerberos authentication next
year you're with certificates

543
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:40,190
no we're not okay

544
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:47,569
somebody said off you do it now and they
asked over there and all who lives over

545
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:50,240
there still awake

546
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,689
no oh ya later

547
00:49:53,690 --> 00:50:02,930
oh that sounds like beer come on that's
it there's still time

548
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:05,930
yeah what is there no no there's no time

549
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:14,400
yeah

550
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:25,270
what you do like we just wanted to thank
those two people because they helped a

551
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:30,910
lot with all the crypto stuff so thanks
to become hardship or something and

552
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:35,500
thanks for your time and the putting up
with us you'll find us on Twitter
