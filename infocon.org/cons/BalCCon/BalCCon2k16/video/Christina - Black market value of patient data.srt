1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:22,840
our next presenter is Christina session

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,290
she's a medical doctor with a specialty
in medical informatics and she'll be

3
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,710
speaking about the value of patient data
on the black market

4
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,730
if you have any questions at the end of
the lecture please go to the microphones

5
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,730
and setting there

6
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:50,800
thank you um yeah this is basically a
continuation and opening a new field in

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:58,419
relation to my talk from yesterday but
you don't need to have seen it to follow

8
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:10,000
this one so to introduce and this topic
i would like to ask you and have any of

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,780
you had any medical problems in the last
12 months

10
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:25,870
ok I see lots of hands I will not ask
any of you what exactly you have had

11
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:35,350
trouble with but I asked you to
visualize if I did um ask you to

12
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:42,729
presented to the audience what you would
feel like if for example the next slide

13
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:49,840
that i'm showing would show exactly what
you have been suffering off and show

14
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,810
your lab results and

15
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,100
from your doctor and just think about
that for a moment

16
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:10,700
and so the research question for this
talk is is there a black market for

17
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:19,280
patient data and if so um two more
questions results which are how much

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,210
does one set of patient data costs on
this black market and why would people

19
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,210
buy it

20
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:38,300
this is not a completed solid research
project it is it has lots of open

21
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:45,590
questions and I ask you if you have any
comments any own experiences and views

22
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:53,330
on the subject or questions to assist
the chance to talk about it after the

23
00:02:53,330 --> 00:03:01,070
job when we have the microphone open so
just start and what we are talking about

24
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:08,030
his personal health data or patient data
what exactly it's personal health data

25
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:16,100
it includes anything that you can think
of that somehow relates to your head

26
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:23,150
it's not only um data from your doctor
like current or previous diagnoses are

27
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:29,150
suspected diagnosis but also all kinds
of information relating to your family

28
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:39,440
and to your habits and something that
most people don't know even affect that

29
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,709
you consulted a doctor is part of your
personal health data and you should be

30
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:52,730
able to keep it confidential if you wish
so so who is interested in patient data

31
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:58,070
and the first group of course and our
doctors and nurses and other medical

32
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:05,239
professionals other therapists that of
course need this data to do their jobs

33
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,560
properly

34
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:16,769
then another group of researchers at
university or its private institutions

35
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:25,889
who wants to use and patient data for
example to contact clinical studies or

36
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:34,650
develop new pharmaceuticals and yeah
anything related to that which leads to

37
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,520
the next group

38
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,219
I'm pharma companies they of course are
also interested in patient data for two

39
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,820
purposes and the first like researchers
and the first purposes they want to

40
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:54,180
develop a new therapies and new drugs
and the Cygnus they also wanted to

41
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:03,660
market these and in order to do this
they also need a patient data then one

42
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:10,080
group that maybe one doesn't think of
right away our insurance companies and

43
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,370
for them patient data is very very
interesting because they want to

44
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:27,180
calculate your risk of dying or falling
sick if you are applying for life

45
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:35,580
insurance for example of other kinds of
a private insurance basically and the

46
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:41,130
more likely you are to get sick or dying
the more expensive you actually

47
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,270
then another group that is increasingly
also interested in patient data are

48
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:55,650
consumer oriented companies especially
in the last few months and years with

49
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:01,799
the increasing development of for
example wearables are quantified self

50
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,160
apps and then last but not least that is
the patient himself or herself

51
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:17,729
who's also interested in keeping his or
her own data and patients have a couple

52
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:26,190
of different attitudes and about sharing
their data most of let's say many

53
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,520
heavens really thought about it

54
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:37,200
um then there are some that are very
open and let's say just take what you

55
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:44,460
need i'm a i'm confident that you will
use it to help me in some way there are

56
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:52,080
some that just don't want to cooperate
with their data and although this group

57
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,539
is often the same group that doesn't
like to consult doctors at all

58
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:05,490
um and you have something and that
should not be forgotten is when you are

59
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:12,690
patient you often and have much larger
problems than thinking about your data

60
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:19,710
usually your main objective is getting
healthy and not thinking about data

61
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,710
sharing policies

62
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:31,460
but in generally the informed patient
that is the patient that is not too sick

63
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:37,818
to think about it wants to share some of
the data with some parties

64
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:49,470
so as we've seen and personal health
data has value to a couple of different

65
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:56,700
groups and and if it has value then it
should be possible to define this value

66
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:02,430
in a financial way there are two ways to
do that and they are by the way

67
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,850
applicable to any kind of personal data
not only personal health data

68
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:14,190
the first is um you look at individual
evaluation that is you ask individuals

69
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:21,540
from either how much they would be
willing to pay to protect their data or

70
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,650
the other way around

71
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:31,590
um how how much they would expect as
compensation if they were to said that

72
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:38,100
data this is the first way from the
second way is based on market valuation

73
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:44,580
where you don't ask an individual but a
group of people are and the market and

74
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:53,790
there are again a couple of different
ways to do that and one may be rather

75
00:08:53,790 --> 00:09:01,650
easy way would be to look at a company
that processes a patient data and then

76
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,090
you take the company's revenue and
divided through the number of data

77
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:14,310
records that Jesus and then you get the
diffraction or revenue number per data

78
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:22,530
record another way is to look at the
cost of a data breach and this consists

79
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:28,560
of a number of different different
figures you have to think about

80
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,890
compensating the victims of a data
breach of spending money for PR to

81
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,730
correct your image with the press

82
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:44,870
cost to increase your security etc and
then the last pitch ways are either to

83
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,220
look at the regular market price for
data because that's also something like

84
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:55,250
that not only the black market and the
topic of this talk to look at the black

85
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,320
market price for data

86
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:05,750
I'm surprisingly this is not very well
investigated for health data which is

87
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:12,290
the reason why i started looking into
this I was surprised that there were

88
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:20,060
relatively little information about the
topic so this is one reason to look at

89
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,989
the black market price and to correctly
estimate the value of personal health

90
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:32,060
data and then there is another reason
which is maybe even more obvious or more

91
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:40,279
important it is to find out about the
motivation of this guy or this guy or

92
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:49,519
this woman for him as a side note i urge
you to look at this URL after my talk

93
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,699
and the funniest take a stock photos so
we want to look at the motivations of

94
00:10:55,699 --> 00:11:05,300
take us that targets personal health
data to do that first I have some

95
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:11,510
numbers for you and in $MONTH 2015
criminal attacks with the most frequent

96
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:17,389
cause of data breaches and half cap for
the first time ever if you compare it to

97
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:26,120
results from 2010 and there is an
increase in 125 percent us data

98
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:37,270
so the vast majority of healthcare
organizations and in $MONTH 2015 had

99
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:43,840
suffered at least two data breaches in
the last two years and most head even

100
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,840
suffered more than that

101
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,630
yeah as I said earlier criminal tick was
the most frequent cause for the first

102
00:11:52,630 --> 00:12:00,640
time in history and the kind of patient
data that was most frequently

103
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:08,020
successfully targeted was indeed medical
files including patient is free current

104
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,180
diagnosis current medication etc as
something that is obviously also

105
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:19,959
interesting are building an insurance
records payment details and so in

106
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:26,710
summary all kinds of financial
information and i will show you some

107
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:35,080
incidents in detain first some from the
US which are very well documented in

108
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:41,080
comparison to other countries in 2015
there were actually lots of them in the

109
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:49,660
US this is the largest data breach that
ever happened and healthcare anywhere in

110
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,360
the world that we know of

111
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:59,230
of course in the for-profit health
insurance company anthem about 80

112
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:04,510
million records of customers and
employees and were stolen including

113
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:09,819
Social Security numbers birthdays
addresses employment information etc and

114
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:15,070
the way the attackers business was to
use men wear and to gain and employees

115
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:23,260
login information a similar incident and
was happened at premera blue cross a

116
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:30,280
non-profit and flora 11 millions 11
million patient records this time also

117
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:36,520
including medical information and this
was a fishing a check and they used the

118
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,400
fake

119
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Thank You Man frontera . com

120
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,060
so a similar one with 10 10 million
records

121
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:53,839
excellus bluecross blueshield social
security numbers and financial data and

122
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:59,960
a smaller one which affected UCLA head
system that's not an insurer but medical

123
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,580
center that includes hospitals and
private practices again including

124
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:11,270
medical information which was to start
without any encryption so here are some

125
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,280
German incidents

126
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:23,510
um not restricted to IT attacks at the
first one is the case of an IT admin was

127
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,490
employed in a medical data center who
copied data from backup tapes from

128
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:35,840
hospitals and doctors offices the reason
why he did this I think I was never made

129
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:43,220
entirely kia then there are some
incidents where data was stolen

130
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:55,220
physically backup tapes in this case the
mechanism was that one employee was sent

131
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,740
to take these pickup tapes to the
storage facility and he then went for a

132
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,560
cigarette break and as he came back the
tapes were gone the hospital since then

133
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,500
implemented a policy that no one may
ever go alone to take these pickup

134
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:20,300
shapes to the room storage facility and
then in another instance endoscopy

135
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:26,719
equipment was stolen and that's the kind
of medical device that is used to look

136
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,770
into your stomach or are the other way
around and it also has internal storage

137
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:40,699
to store patient data so whenever one of
these gets stolen then the data on it

138
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,810
gets stolen as when

139
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:49,180
and something that sounds kind of
old-fashioned but has happened recently

140
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:58,150
is that physical patient fires on on
paper from hospitals that went out of

141
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:05,350
business were actually lift in those
buildings and an interested reporter or

142
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:10,210
I'm just about anyone could drive now
with the van and I picked these patient

143
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:20,410
fires and drive away and then if you
want about ransomware um there were many

144
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:27,730
infections in hospitals with several
types of ransomware in 2016 especially

145
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,920
in germany and the US but also in canada
and new zealand and but I didn't make

146
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:39,189
this the focus of my job because it's
not a theft in the strict sense it's

147
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:48,070
more like a hostage situation with data
so why does data theft

148
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:56,860
I'm happen in health camp analysts say
that's one reason why it is possible is

149
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,360
that some defenses and healthcare
systems are inferior to the defenses and

150
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,699
other industries like for example the
banking industry who have been working

151
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:09,760
hard on their defenses for quite a long
time

152
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:18,189
the second is and as we saw previously
that has data is inherently valuable it

153
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:24,339
is useful not only for the patient and
for related professionals but obviously

154
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:28,240
also two hypothetical attacker

155
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,890
so what is the financial world of
patient data and the FBI estimates that

156
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:44,419
one set of patient records were 50 West
dollars a company and

157
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:49,669
fishlips which offer cybercrime
protection and estimates the world bit

158
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:55,669
lower at ten US dollars and yet another
company Beasley says that it is between

159
00:17:55,669 --> 00:18:02,149
40 and 50 West dollars as a side note in
when somewhere

160
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:08,268
the victims are usually asked to pay 200
to 300 US dollars protect and every

161
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:17,149
attack includes several hundreds to
thousands of patient files but in single

162
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:24,649
cases in targeted attacks several
million u.s. dollars have been demanded

163
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:34,998
as a ransom so I will look in detail at
the largest known transaction with

164
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:40,639
patient data on the black market which
happens on the black market place the

165
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:41,840
real deal

166
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,949
the seller was someone who called
himself the dark overlord and he put up

167
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:56,059
his office in two steps on the first day
he offered 655,000 records which were

168
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:01,158
taken from three victims and on the
second day of nine million records from

169
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:09,440
another victim in the first week three
cases and as he said himself he used

170
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,720
usernames and passwords that will start
without encryption in databases that

171
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,639
were accessible in misconfigured
networks and the fourth case was

172
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:25,039
different he there exploited a
vulnerability in windows remote desktop

173
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,190
protocol

174
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:34,730
this is a screenshot of the patient data
he gave a sample of the state a to an

175
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:42,080
independent journalist working for deep
. web engine strongest was then able to

176
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:50,720
verify the data I think it's not it's
not really dead eligible for um all in

177
00:19:50,720 --> 00:20:00,289
the audience but i can say here you can
see you can see but you could see the

178
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:06,080
patient's family history of the diseases
that his parents affected and you can

179
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,779
see that he used to be a smoker that is
carpal tunnel syndrome that he is being

180
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:18,500
treated with an opiate and yea and all
kinds of sensitive personal information

181
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:28,940
as selling this was not the dark
overlords and first plan and actually

182
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:35,269
first attempted to extort money from the
victims in one case he asked the

183
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:40,940
hospital to pay 160 thousand US dollars
and the other cases the ransom some is

184
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:46,850
not known but he himself said that he
demanded less than 1 million dollars in

185
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:54,289
every case but when each one of the
victims declined he put this offer on

186
00:20:54,289 --> 00:21:00,860
the Rio dia and they are surprised his
largest database it's 500,000 to

187
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:08,178
astrologers and if you use their Bitcoin
way from Jim 2016 that leads to a price

188
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:16,309
of only five us cents per record y solo
and that several reasons in this case of

189
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:22,009
course and i think by discount comes
into play because no one would be either

190
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:27,680
with willing or able to pay 500 million
u.s. dollars before this year

191
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,980
database and then of course he's
basically doing recycling of his heat

192
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,620
because his first intention was a
different one he wanted to extort money

193
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:46,489
and then and the third reason may be
that he already had concerns about the

194
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:53,720
data quality because this independent
journalist i mentioned before checked

195
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:59,660
some of the data he actually went and
called the patients and this way he

196
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:06,500
found out that some of the data was
already expired and not not really

197
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:17,810
current anymore so the question is and
if there are databases like this and put

198
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,980
up for sale

199
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:26,750
who's willing to buy and why would they
buy it and the business models behind

200
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,850
this

201
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:36,290
I on the one hand are confirmed and
business motors that means things that

202
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:45,350
have already happened and one of them is
of course extortion you can x torch the

203
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:52,250
institutions that the data is coming
from but you also have some leverage

204
00:22:52,250 --> 00:23:00,950
against the individual patients so both
of this is possible then something that

205
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:07,670
is I think quite specific to the US
healthcare system is medical identity

206
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:15,890
effect which means you use another
person's data and to gain access to

207
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:22,790
their health insurance and to get a
diagnosis and treatment that your own

208
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:29,510
insurance does not cover and since there
are lots of uninsured individuals in the

209
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,470
US

210
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:39,539
this is a valid business model and
however in other systems it's not in

211
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:47,820
Germany most of the population insurance
and this for this kind of identity that

212
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:56,280
that's just not the same motivation but
um you can use the same data to perform

213
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,980
other kinds of identity theft

214
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:07,049
you don't own not only have medical
information but dates like both dates

215
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:13,230
address financial data and you can take
this and perform identity theft for

216
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:23,429
example to gain access to bank accounts
and the last confirmed business model

217
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:30,929
and that is something that does happen
sometimes is selling the medical data of

218
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:38,700
of VIPs to the tabloid media and this
has happened in cases like for example

219
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:49,320
the death of michael jackson and the
death or serious disease of any kind of

220
00:24:49,320 --> 00:25:00,689
actor or singer or a person of public
interest in contrast to this buying and

221
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:09,000
selling of you to databases and this
should be a targeted attack so i would

222
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,179
guess that it is most likely to succeed
if you target for example a doctor or

223
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:21,210
nurse of whom you know that they are
treating a certain individual if you buy

224
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:26,070
a huge database and of course you can
speculate that there may be someone

225
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:31,460
interesting in it but i'm not sure if
that would be as successful and

226
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:39,500
provided good um let's say return on
investment as something that may be

227
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:47,419
happening but we don't know and is the
use of data for foreign espionage and

228
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:52,700
something like this has been
hypothesized in one of the data breach

229
00:25:52,700 --> 00:26:00,020
cases i showed you earlier namely anthem
there are some analysts set and that's

230
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:07,490
the attack seems to come from China and
they thought that maybe the Chinese

231
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:12,320
government was interested in gaining
insights into the economic and social

232
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,799
conditions that these data provide but
as I said this has been confirmed so far

233
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:23,029
and another thing that is pure
speculation is that a medical data would

234
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:26,390
also be interesting for private
companies like health insurance and

235
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:32,000
research and development but to my
knowledge no instance of a private

236
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,140
company buying this kind of data on the
black market has been reported

237
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:47,779
of course you would expect that I'm in
each of these each of these theories of

238
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:56,090
business models there is a large amount
of unrecorded cases and so to summarize

239
00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:03,980
and the theft of healthcare data is on
the rise of the prices of single set of

240
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:10,039
patient data seem to vary between five
us cents and 50 US dollars per ticket

241
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:15,110
and there is a variety of business
models behind it and the most important

242
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:21,320
ones are extortion and identity theft
and there are certainly a high number of

243
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:29,299
unrecorded cases so I'm thank you for
your attention so far and I would

244
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:33,020
appreciate any of our questions and
comments that you may have

245
00:27:52,990 --> 00:28:01,480
thank you for another interesting talk
i'm curious now is a good yeah since

246
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,559
you're a doctor yes while you were
investigating this were you concerned at

247
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,678
all that maybe some spy agency would
think that you're trying to sell your

248
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:18,910
patients data on the black market and no
as I said in one of the first slides and

249
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:25,660
it's caught my attention when i saw that
data breaches and healthcare were being

250
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,520
reported and ask myself if someone is
stealing it

251
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:38,530
then why what what's the motivation and
yeah I started doing it and there was no

252
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:45,070
there was no easy answer and I thought
why is that there's lots of literature

253
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:52,870
about data theft in banking and how to
buy credit card data and whatever but

254
00:28:52,870 --> 00:29:00,820
healthcare seemed to be like a blind
spot in that regard so this just struck

255
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,820
my fancy

256
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:34,370
hi I think it's a very interesting topic
because it's like new and emerging

257
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:39,530
market for instance here in Serbia I
don't know about no Assad about race but

258
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:46,430
in my hometown punchable few months ago
this they started using full electronic

259
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:54,560
patient charts and I had some experience
with working for a hospital and I know

260
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:01,190
that they don't take they don't
understand the risks and that they don't

261
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:08,540
take security seriously so passports of
users using computers are written down

262
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:15,290
patients or someone who is looking for
some data can sometimes even get

263
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:22,820
physical access to the computers and for
instance i know they think connections

264
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:28,220
between the different locations of
hospitals in the city are connected with

265
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:34,040
VPN that is not encrypted I also know
that they use the equipment that is not

266
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:42,110
like secure and so on so i think that
Serbia will be a hunting ground for four

267
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:47,030
people trying to sell these kinds of
data i also think you mentioned

268
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:52,790
correctly that insurance companies but
also pharmaceutical companies are

269
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:57,770
interested in this kind of data because
it can tell them in which directions to

270
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:03,500
to put money so i think they will be
giving money of maybe even to the black

271
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,370
market

272
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:10,159
yes yes i think so and the problems
mentioned am NOT not specific to Serbia

273
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,269
ok and and

274
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:21,679
and about the motivation to buy data on
the black market I think for consumer

275
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:28,789
oriented companies and this is still
maybe not really necessary because there

276
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:34,339
are lots of ways and they can make
consumers give up their personal health

277
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:41,299
information voluntarily if you think
about all kinds of peps and quantified

278
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:49,549
self apps that send your data somewhere
and not every one of its users ever

279
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:52,820
bothers to find out where the data is
being sent

280
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,829
so I'm consumer oriented companies they
have their own ways of getting data and

281
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:04,940
so maybe they are not as likely to buy
through these dark channel

282
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,430
yeah

283
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,350
I

284
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:23,049
when this the data talked about our
morning show on the screen shot had all

285
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:27,400
sorts of personal information about
patient's so is there anything in the

286
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,230
sense also selling anonymized data from
the users so saying only the relevant

287
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:38,919
parts to medical research or whatever um
yeah thatthat's can actually be done on

288
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:40,120
regular markets

289
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,469
ok so this is how it was the price how
the price goes in the regular market for

290
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:50,500
this kind of information and honestly I
don't know that I would have to look

291
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,419
that up if if you're interested you can
send me an email and i will try to find

292
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:58,419
out

293
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:17,930
and so there are no more questions and
comments now that's 1i i come from

294
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:25,970
hospital to so how your colleague react
about protection from data what they

295
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:34,730
know about that and danger of selling
data and people from the hospital who

296
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,420
work there

297
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:43,520
what is your I I'm touched a bit about
the subject yesterday and the security

298
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:53,270
of data often is a compromised because
convenience is more important than

299
00:33:53,270 --> 00:34:00,260
security in in a certain moment and I
think this is the number one reason of a

300
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:09,500
white why data are insecure in the
healthcare sector and I think that many

301
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:17,989
people know about the risks to a patient
data safety and they are willing to

302
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:23,089
implement some security but only if it's
not too inconvenient but i think there's

303
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:30,560
also a high number of people and that
don't really know about the risk of data

304
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,480
theft and this is also one of the
reasons why i was interested in this

305
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:42,469
subject because um when you think about
it as a as a person who works in

306
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:49,279
healthcare but has never been educated
on the subject of data security then I'm

307
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,810
your first thought and maybe a well who
would be interested who who wants to

308
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,029
wants this data what can you do with it

309
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:05,660
just a data some random persons that you
may never have seen it doesn't have any

310
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:10,620
value and I think that maybe the first
touch of a person that is a

311
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:18,240
naive to the subject and I think that's
a justified question and one of the

312
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,240
reasons why I chose to investigate a
bitch

313
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:26,670
thank you

314
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,930
and yeah as I said yesterday i'm i'm
still available here on the conference

315
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:44,500
and of course the email i will be happy
to hear about any more comments and

316
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,039
questions by email and thank you again
for your

317
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:57,259
yeah
