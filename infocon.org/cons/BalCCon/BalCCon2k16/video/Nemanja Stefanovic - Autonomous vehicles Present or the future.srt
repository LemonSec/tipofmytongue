1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:24,240
this lecture will be about autonomous
vehicle and is it the president of the

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,288
future a speaker members families will
speak about story how modern technology

3
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:32,850
affects our life

4
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,460
kranti currently an M&A is working on a
startup that will change the way people

5
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,710
find job he's a drone enthusiasts and
developer and entrepreneur so please

6
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,710
give a warm welcome for men

7
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:56,969
thank you is can you hear me ok cool so
first out so I'm sorry that I'm delayed

8
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,800
i was trying from Belgrade than i had
some video conference I couldn't delay

9
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,530
our it's good to see you like this many
people last year outside the lecture

10
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:17,310
about drones drones are my passion so at
that time I was in more into that but as

11
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,330
as i'm already presented as a start-up
founder of that at that point I was

12
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,380
starting the startup about changing the
way people find jobs and we got an

13
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,630
investment so most last year I was doing
a product that project like they didn't

14
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,798
have time for drones or anything else
and are ideal last year was to organize

15
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,909
a drawing workshop this year but
unfortunately I couldn't I didn't have

16
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,100
time to organize that so i'll talk about
something that I'm very fascinated in

17
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,339
the last few months and something that
I'm reading a lot and researching so

18
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:01,439
that topic will be autonomous vehicles
and acids lecture about big quite short

19
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,820
like maybe 40 45 minutes and that's that
I want to have a discussion with you

20
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,640
about your opinions about that kind of
technology and how you see that future

21
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,890
do you think that that's the President
or that technology will improve in

22
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:24,029
future so first of all stop are starting
with the funny slide and you can see

23
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,130
like it's a police officer to stop the
car and he asked why were you speeding

24
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,299
and is that speeding officer please ask
the car

25
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,010
I don't know so this quite old but this
is something that that's really

26
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:45,480
happening in the world right now all
cars are really driving themselves and

27
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,320
people are less driving the cars then
two or three years ago so I start from

28
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,910
the beginnings how the autonomous car
started

29
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:04,859
yeah their stories so in nineteen
thirties there was a very very big world

30
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,269
fair in new york and it was very well
different than other world Fair's

31
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:16,290
because it represented the future of the
American Dream and all the cars were not

32
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,410
all the cars but they were there were
cars that for autonomous they try to

33
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,000
show how the how the future will look
like it it's called futurama that the

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,280
team of that show was futurama how about
how the world will look in fifty or

35
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,160
hundred years so I don't they presented
I think General Motors presented the car

36
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,950
that was autonomous it was following a
rail and that's that's the first science

37
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:48,238
of autonomous cars are of course then
the world the second world war happened

38
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,610
then all those dreams about self-driving
cars vanished people focused on other

39
00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:00,420
things to make weapons and not cars but
then after the Second World War I came

40
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,390
to industrial revolution America where
technology from the war started going to

41
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:14,100
private hands and a lot of companies
that produce cars thought that rivaled I

42
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,950
driverless cars will be the future but
not future as we say like they believe

43
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,140
that that will happen in 10 to 15 years
from that point and on the right side

44
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,930
you can see an advertisement from 57
where our two families are true two

45
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,370
couples are driving in their car but
they don't drive the car they play I

46
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,530
think scramble or something like that
and the highway has a center line that

47
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,190
the car is following and that they
believe that this will happen in the

48
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,919
next 10 years at that point so that's
the sixties but of course that never

49
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,950
happened technology was very robust and
very analog so that couldn't happen at

50
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:01,890
that point later on in the sixties those
dreams vanished but they still try to

51
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:07,229
make something something that was a
self-driving so in the UK they tried

52
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:12,180
different approaches 1 of 1 of this most
successful approach that point was to

53
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:19,200
lay cables with magnets under the road
and the car is following those magnets

54
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,500
so it has a sensor so sense where the
magnets are and falls that that back our

55
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,860
main problem with all those ideas that
at that time and technologies that they

56
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,150
were too expensive

57
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,560
you couldn't put that kind of technology
adjusting the car you had to build an

58
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,710
infrastructure completely new friend
said she had to build the completely new

59
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,710
roads with magnetic stripes in them or
whatever

60
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,590
of course it wasn't that right reliable
accidents happen

61
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,539
of course it was to analyze that's
that's before the digital revolution

62
00:05:54,539 --> 00:06:00,870
with before the microchips so at that
point a lot of manufacturers tried

63
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:07,770
something of most of them failed i think
chrysler made the very interesting car

64
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,930
called fiber it has it had also system
though so it could drive itself it has

65
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,919
reduced the rail on the side of the
highway as you connected to the rail

66
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,969
involves the rail but it could also
sense when someone is strung them but

67
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,570
that was too expensive your heads you
still have to build the rail used to

68
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:30,330
build had to build the highway so it
wouldn't work that way up so then came

69
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,090
the revolution

70
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:37,690
microcontrollers microchips that was the
biggest revolution and for us of course

71
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:42,729
but at that point people understood that
they could take that out technology and

72
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:47,139
bring it to digital age with microchips
and processors and it could do things

73
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:48,760
that they couldn't do before

74
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,570
also computer vision became the things
they've started in the seventies alright

75
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:01,900
they start using very primitive ccd
cameras to sense motion sense different

76
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,580
objects in the path and the couple that
with digital processor school that would

77
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:13,599
understand that and create some kind of
computer vision and 111 guy was a

78
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,419
pioneering that in that in that thing
and he did he did some some cool stuff

79
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:24,010
and his name was Aaron statement is a
German engineering aerospace engineer

80
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:30,940
but he was very interested into
self-driving cars and in the eighties

81
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:37,450
Dave he and his team built the most day
to curve sit very normal Mercedes car

82
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:42,940
and they put electronic chips enter it
and it called bombers are that's shocked

83
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,050
if I don't know presented fraud and it's
used to cameras to create the stairs .

84
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:53,410
scopic you and it's used very very
simple 16-bit processors at that time

85
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:58,960
and they successfully draw it for 20
kilometers on itself so the car had the

86
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,539
program bad its new the surrounding to
some point they always had the driver of

87
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:10,389
course behind the wheel if something was
wrong but they drove event calendars are

88
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:18,940
later on the same team are further
developed that that model and i-94 they

89
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,280
created vamp there's a successful for
the Bombers car and it had better of

90
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,809
course cameras better microchips and it
would sense road sciences good sense

91
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:35,229
obstacles that concerns other cars in
the car new in which lane it was and

92
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:42,370
they successfully tested the car driving
from minutes to Copenhagen that some 900

93
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,179
kilometers

94
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:49,089
off-road and the car was ninety-five
percent autonomous so only five percent

95
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:54,730
of that 900 kilometers the driver to
keep the the car but everything else was

96
00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:04,029
done by the computer then again the
development of microchips more

97
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:09,580
microchips everywhere cheaper everything
else so came to thousands that after

98
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:16,570
the.com bubble and the US government saw
the potential in driverless vehicles

99
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:22,180
drivers cars and they started the
financing through DARPA and through US

100
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:28,599
Army financing private or government
funded competitions to see which private

101
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,070
team could build the better

102
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:37,360
driverless car so there was a few of
demo days or demo project that they they

103
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:45,190
organized but none of them were actually
that successful until 2004-2005 I think

104
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,149
it's a fine

105
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:54,370
so the ADL behind those demos was they
created the test track in the desert

106
00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:01,720
it was 140 miles around 280 kilometres
and it has very various landscapes road

107
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:08,740
rocks trees everything and the car was
programmed to come from one point to the

108
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:17,650
end of the course and most of the team's
really failed but then all the major

109
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,760
moment manufactures cars in that at that
time try to do something with the

110
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,089
autonomous cars they tried building it
they try testing it

111
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:29,920
there's like here you can see John
motorsport mistake is volkswagen

112
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,310
everyone tried our it was hard because
they didn't still have the knowledge to

113
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,939
do that they're more focused on classic
cars and that that's probably the

114
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,950
biggest problem an obstacle for them
because they're too focused on classic

115
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,100
cars where you buy it you drive it

116
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,970
they don't think that the innovative
technology will change the drive because

117
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,470
if that happens

118
00:10:53,470 --> 00:11:00,430
probably their sales will drop but again
the new chips new computers we have like

119
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,109
this thing is stronger have more
processing power than the pollination

120
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:12,940
computer are and it's cheaper 10,000
times cheaper than that probably so

121
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:18,070
everything that kind of technology
really made it very simple for people to

122
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:25,420
try out to build autonomous cars so
there's two major players that that saw

123
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,870
the potential in that and that's
definitely google and Tesla they start

124
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,620
thinking about the autonomy they had the
technology they had they had the the

125
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,920
engineers who can do that and they
wanted to try so i'll call this thing

126
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,939
like Google way and we have a test away
and we have a third way that's more

127
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:56,380
interesting than both of these so I said
DARPA which is US defense of ministries

128
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:06,100
how is a extended I doubt that's the
agency that deals with innovations in

129
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:12,100
the defense industry in the US so as I
always said they started a few

130
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,320
challenges for people for private teams
to build the autonomous cars and there

131
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,880
was one team in 2005 that was very
successful they completed the course and

132
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,760
that was a team from Stanford University
and that theme was a team that later

133
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,420
moved on to google to develop the
autonomous car for google at that point

134
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:39,670
google didn't have the interest to build
of autonomous cars for the masses they

135
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,140
needed it for themselves they started
the product called Google Street View

136
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:50,590
and they needed the cheap way to map the
whole world and the film every street

137
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,760
and everything and their idea was to
create the autonomous cars that drive

138
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,890
themselves wherever and takes pictures
of it so it it's like a good combination

139
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,420
because it already has cameras and why
not use that information in real time

140
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,250
too

141
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:13,440
guide itself and take pictures they used
to modify regular cars are and put

142
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,950
lighter song and put the collision
sensors and detectors and it was very

143
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:25,320
simple way to do that because their
investment in one car was around 150,000

144
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,150
years which is relatively cheap and the
most expensive part was the lighter

145
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:36,930
which they had to buy and it costs
around eight thousand dollars that . but

146
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:42,180
of course the world changed a day they
didn't need autonomous cars I more for

147
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,890
that project so they saw potential to
create autonomous cars for the masses

148
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,720
and as you can see on the right that
they're out that Google's first

149
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,840
autonomous cars that that car doesn't
have pedals it doesn't have the steering

150
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,920
wheel has nothing you just sit in it you
tell you very well but want to go and

151
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,030
you go there and in 2016

152
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:11,490
they have traveled not google sometimes
cars had traveled more than 2 million

153
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:18,420
kilometers completely autonomously so
that that's good feat chris i think they

154
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,130
have more than 150 cars that they're
testing on different platform different

155
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,500
different cars

156
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,530
ok so now we're coming to Tesla way
which in my opinion is more interesting

157
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:36,839
than google's way are so Tesla didn't
have any intentions to create the

158
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:43,110
driverless car if they wanted to create
the efficient car a car that doesn't

159
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,610
pollute and everything else but in the
beginning they didn't think about five

160
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:54,810
driverless cars are so as they put that
kind of technology into a card that has

161
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:00,329
a serious computing power to I don't
distribute the power between the

162
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,660
drivetrain and the batteries and
everything else it has navigation has

163
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,850
everything it so it has very strong
microchips in and computers they started

164
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,770
thinking why wouldn't we use that
computing power to create the car that

165
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:18,010
will be driverless and at that point
that was

166
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:23,980
very secret people you know what they
were building and thinking about but in

167
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:30,910
September 2014 all cars after that have
a integral have an integrated video

168
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:36,069
camera in the windshield and they have
radar detectors and ultrasonic sensors

169
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:40,690
before that some did some didn't but
after at every car that they produced

170
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:46,540
every model s has those kind of
equipment and the most interesting thing

171
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:52,599
is that actually the autopilot in the
Tesla is just the software updates so

172
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,560
you you don't have you don't need to
have any special equipment that's the

173
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,099
equipment that you already have in the
car yesterday you didn't know it could

174
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,960
drive itself today you get an
over-the-air update and now it can drive

175
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,050
itself so that's that's by mapping a
very strong thing that you can change

176
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:17,020
something with by an update and you you
just give completely set of features

177
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:22,270
those features didn't exist yesterday
today you can summon the car should come

178
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:29,560
in front of your building so their
station what you must set here and he

179
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,099
said full autonomy is really a software
limitation to Harvard exist to create

180
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,090
full autonomy so it's really about
developing advanced narrow AI for the

181
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:42,490
car to operate on so of they just
understood that they may already have

182
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,540
enough electrons they already have
enough of brain power in the car just

183
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:54,730
make an update and it will work and and
this is hacking conference so I'm coming

184
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:00,790
to the third way which is my favorite
way and i like this guy very much

185
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:07,180
because he did some cool stuff and yeah
first equipment but I don't know this

186
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,110
that important it has three sensors like
this for the model s sorry I skipped

187
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:17,439
this all this part as I said they have
very simple equipment just the front

188
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,579
front mounted camera they have a radar
system in the bumper and they have

189
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:26,589
ultrasonic sensors that cover 360
degrees around the car it's very very

190
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,419
cheap equipment the probably the most
expensive thing is

191
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:35,150
the radar component everything else is
very very straightforward and simple up

192
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,560
yeah so we're coming to third way and
this is the hackers way how to build the

193
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:47,720
autonomous and self-driving car are this
guy in the picture that george hotz he

194
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,690
uses similar accurate monday thread
called jihad and his famous for two

195
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,770
things first

196
00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,139
he was the first one who are jailbroken
iphone and second he was the first one

197
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:10,970
who jailbroke a ps3 so the guys five
billion and I watched quite a few of his

198
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,430
interviews and thing is that he just
said like why would I build the car that

199
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,150
drives itself that that's the only thing
that was in is buying why would I buy

200
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:26,810
something that expensive my can build it
on my own arm so he started thinking

201
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:31,370
about that and he from the moment they
start thinking in a few months I think

202
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,850
three or four months he already had the
car that can drive itself

203
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,820
I the biggest investment in everything
that he did was to go out and buy the

204
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,030
car and the car costs I don't four
thousand dollars

205
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:51,950
everything else was quite cheap in that
sense he also had problems because he

206
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,330
didn't know how to couple the car to
computer because he bought the honda or

207
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:03,500
Korra into us so he thought away or how
to do that he starting started going on

208
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,750
a course for fondest mechanics and
finish the degree to become a honda

209
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,440
mechanic and then he got all the manuals
for the cars

210
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,140
I don't like this home so you at that
point in you how to connect to the car

211
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,580
that was the biggest problem at that
point that he didn't outsole but he sold

212
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:31,010
it on so of this is the trunk of his car
he used very simple equipment it's it's

213
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:35,960
it's not even a laptop it's a desktop
computer that you put in his trunk uses

214
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,110
a AC DC converter to convert the power
from

215
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:45,689
the batteries are I don't I guess he had
some ups or by I think that would be

216
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:51,750
smart but i don't use that i use very
simple and natural cameras that he puts

217
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:58,530
on the windshield are an interesting
thing is huge lot lineups here is a boon

218
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:03,750
to and he created very simple script I
mean is a simple it's much simpler than

219
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,220
that's all the party still not that
simple because it's machine learning but

220
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:17,040
the whole script ransom python and the
main difference between this system or

221
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:23,159
gearhart system to the system that will
use certain slaw is that this system

222
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,490
learns much quicker by the way how you
drive

223
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:33,270
so that's law is working in a completely
different way they run simulations on

224
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:37,410
their own computers to stimulate every
occasion that can happen when you drive

225
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:42,929
a car and that's very time-consuming and
power consuming because he has to know

226
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:47,130
every single thing that that could
happen in front of your car if somebody

227
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:53,280
runs in front required for ex cetera are
but gia hold thought that this was very

228
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:59,129
unofficial because you need raw
computing power to do that and his

229
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,340
algorithm is built so it learns how you
drive

230
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:10,770
so at first moment when you start the
car that has system in it you can you

231
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:16,620
cannot let it drive itself because it
needs at least few days to learn how you

232
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,299
drive and even at that point when it
learned the basics how do you start the

233
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:27,450
car how do i change the gear even at
that point you can only turn it on for

234
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:33,570
like five minutes and those five minutes
are for example of normal stretch of

235
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:37,918
road where there's no traffic but it's
learns next time you turn it on for 10

236
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:45,419
minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes at at some
point the computer will learn how you

237
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,080
drive and what's happening around you

238
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,490
need to know how to react so that's
that's the most important difference

239
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,320
what he's doing to what test our Google
is doing they're trying to put every

240
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:04,039
situation into the car and this way you
teach the car about those situations so

241
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:09,110
it's completely done for machine
learning and big data he collects every

242
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:14,870
data that we can while you drive the car
and the computer analyzes it and does

243
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,949
the computations and create situations
that so the car knows what's gonna

244
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,580
happen

245
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:26,120
there's a funny story of when jihad
wanted to present his car through the

246
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,469
media he went to Las Vegas I think that
it was some some kind of computer

247
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:34,789
conference there and there was one huge
problem

248
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:41,330
geo hot where he lives at the lane
dividers are white lines like in Serbia

249
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:46,189
but in last vegas it's not like that
they have some form of bumps that are

250
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:51,529
not white their orange and he couldn't
sleep because the whole idea was to put

251
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:58,279
a media guy into the car and let the car
drive them and didn't test the car you

252
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:01,730
didn't know how it will react on the
bumps not on the white lines that are

253
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:06,980
that the because usual to our and he
couldn't sleep that night and he took it

254
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,740
for drive the whole night he drove it
around Las Vegas and in the morning it

255
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:18,889
worked perfectly the car knew how the
plane divides itself by those orange

256
00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:25,010
cones or bumps so at that point in you
that the system is really working and

257
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:30,980
that it is reliable to learn about the
environment about everything else around

258
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:40,970
it and he's very very clever thing that
he did because he is one guy he did

259
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,320
start the company but they they have
some formal investment but they didn't

260
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,549
want to invest into a large fleet of
cars and everything and he has only one

261
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:57,260
car so how will he learn the system of
about the situation that didn't happen

262
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,299
to him

263
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:03,830
if there was a car in Las Vegas he would
know that the plane dividers are not

264
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,330
lines but bumps but he didn't have a car
and he didn't have the money to buy

265
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:14,239
current to send one to Las Vegas so he
thought about very simple simple of

266
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:20,419
thing to do he created an app that you
turn on and you put your phone into the

267
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:25,789
windshield and it's just everything you
do it takes data from your accelerometer

268
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:31,039
and every other sensors that you have
there and films and it uploads those

269
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:37,220
film photos video recordings to his
server and then he just runs the machine

270
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:44,600
learning algorithm and it learns what
happened to to you in your car it's a nu

271
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,789
you earned credit for for filming so
it's very simple and very cheap way to

272
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:55,730
that's actually grow tacking he hacked
the system that he would need much more

273
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,869
money to do he acted through a simple
application that probably they build in

274
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:00,980
like five days

275
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:10,369
currently he created the company called
coma I oh and their goal and their idea

276
00:25:10,369 --> 00:25:17,689
is to create a driverless kit that
that's his words that will sell on

277
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:23,090
amazon in less than a thousand dollars
by the end of this year that you can put

278
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:29,029
in almost any new car so that that's
like completely different way of

279
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:34,220
thinking then ill mask or Google or
anyone he wants to create it to be very

280
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,669
cheap you can just plug in plate into
your car and it works

281
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:45,320
we'll see how about how is well do he
already have some form investment are in

282
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,879
started but we'll see if you reach that
goal to do that in the end of the year

283
00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:59,418
okay all so that's let's say that
supposed to the side of hacking drivers

284
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:04,700
cars you take a normal car you put
equipment that you can buy in your pc

285
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:10,500
shop and you create something that the
drive itself but what happens

286
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:16,920
when people that you don't want to have
access to your car and that's something

287
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,620
that's a real threat

288
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:25,560
all most new cars that you buy that
alike year-old have some form of Wi-Fi

289
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,370
chip in it they have some form of
entertainment system that connects to

290
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:36,090
blue to that connects to some kind of of
radio signals and those systems are

291
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:41,699
actually very integrated into the car
itself so if you want to have for

292
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,440
example I Drive an old model but still
it has some form of a connection between

293
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,410
the engine and the infotainment system
if i drive faster music louder that's a

294
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:57,810
very simple thing but it still proves
that cars even before think 10 years ago

295
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:02,070
were connected different agencies and
engines today it's completely connected

296
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:06,270
you can check all the information to
entertainment system or through the

297
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:11,580
dashboard screen about your engine about
everything and still you can connect

298
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:16,050
your phone to that by just clicking like
a Bluetooth button and you're connected

299
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:23,190
to Wi-Fi button you're connected to the
car I'll so the the biggest pitfall or

300
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:28,920
of that technology that will be very
hackable people who could access your

301
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,400
car could drive it could crash it who do
whatever they like

302
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:41,160
if the technology is not improved quite
so they even tried that in $MONTH 2015

303
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:49,290
are you guys exploiters security issue
in jeeps and they take they completely

304
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:53,010
stopped the car in the middle of a
highway just by connecting through

305
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:57,030
bluetooth to the entertainment system
they hacked into the engine and they

306
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:01,920
hacked into the brake system and they
put the parking brake on while or taking

307
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,030
out of transmission mature something
about that while you were in motion on a

308
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,030
highway so that's very serious thing

309
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,810
even that happened but there's even
something worse that could happen and

310
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:24,129
the researchers believe that this is a
very very realistic scenario you wake up

311
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:29,560
you drink your coffee you enter your car
you want to turn the car on and on the

312
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,540
screen there's a message that

313
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,320
hey the discards hijacked if you wanted
to turn on please

314
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:42,310
I don't know past 50 bitcoins and that's
something that is very serious like that

315
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:47,169
that's called transformer and that could
happen to two cars there's the connector

316
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:51,280
on the internet Tesla's are always
connected in there so for example they

317
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:56,560
always you can always update that's like
over-the-air you can always success at a

318
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:01,629
slower the internet you know where it is
you can turn the AC on by by using an

319
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:10,150
application on mobile you could directly
very easily hack into a Tesla and that

320
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:16,480
that's does the biggest problem with god
I said like here I okie that driver's

321
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,650
car sorry I OT that's interactive things
you connect things that didn't have

322
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,880
internet connection they didn't have
connectivity you connect them between

323
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:31,360
each other though there's also one
serious thing that will happen and it

324
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,679
happened that the cars will be connected
between them so that's called

325
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:41,530
vehicle-to-vehicle connection so of you
will know the speed of the car that may

326
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,910
be one kilometer in front of you because
that will create much more safer

327
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:51,130
environment for the car to know what's
happening around them but again if you

328
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:56,530
had that large system you can crash all
the cars in the same time and that's

329
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:03,070
very serious I mean that could also
happen so this is by my opinion the

330
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:08,200
biggest problem with the drivers cars
with things that are connected to each

331
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:16,600
other is that is they're prone to
hacking arm so i said i would be short i

332
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:22,659
would like to have more discussion than
lecture because i'm not that big expert

333
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,669
on this but i would like to hear what
you think

334
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:31,179
about the technology when everything
else so and ask any questions that you

335
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:34,179
want whatever

336
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:48,110
thank you so questions ideas

337
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,970
yeah

338
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,190
ok

339
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:09,100
ok

340
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,100
yeah

341
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,340
so i think i read that with self-driving
ability of the test like our it doesn't

342
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,389
work if you don't have your hands on the
steering wheel or if you take your hands

343
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,910
away for more than I don't know 10
seconds

344
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,390
it kind of gives an alarm or something
can you explain a bit more about how

345
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,220
this function is implemented

346
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:37,700
yeah but i think they already made
cheated on that system because they feel

347
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,720
there's quite a few videos and enter
there where people don't don't all their

348
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,400
hands on the driving wheel so I think
it's very treatable

349
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:52,430
well I don't know haha there's there's a
few crashes that happened with that's

350
00:31:52,430 --> 00:32:00,440
not many i think around 10 or 12 in the
last year our most of them are human

351
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,480
errors that those situations probably
wouldn't be able to be handled by human

352
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,770
better than this but if they had their
hands on the steering wheel maybe they

353
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:15,560
could do something but most of them
didn't have any reaction so I think that

354
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,159
system where you hold the steering wheel
is very hackable

355
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,850
I don't think that that works that well

356
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:28,530
yeah

357
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:38,870
how do you feel about moral questions of
driverless cars for example like the mom

358
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:45,439
the picture which showed in the
beginning or for example hypothetical

359
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,670
situation where car has to choose which
biker to hit in the if if it should hit

360
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:57,590
one with the no helmet on or if you
should get one without the helmet on and

361
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:02,689
and all the implications of these
choices and and and decisions which

362
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,920
basically will make be made by
programmers you know

363
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:17,210
yeah okay I'm moral implications and I'm
not sure that it's gonna work that way

364
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:22,880
you said it's made by programmers those
decisions but actually those decisions

365
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,840
are made through an algorithm that
teaches cells how to drive

366
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:32,990
of course you you will give him some
form of knowledge in the beginning but

367
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:39,410
it will learn and I don't think that it
would be a decision to hit one bike or

368
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:46,250
different bike i think that if you have
enough kilometers and if you have enough

369
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,250
data behind it it wouldn't hit anyone

370
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:57,260
that's the ideal situation I i don't
think that i think we're quite far from

371
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:03,200
that kind of artificial intelligence
that will be conscious about the axis it

372
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,060
is doing this is machine learning
program that learns what it should do

373
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:17,179
and should not do the only way i see it
hitting in the future not right now

374
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,260
right now

375
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,370
accidents happen and that's all of the
dough systems are still developing in

376
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:28,638
the future are the only way to hit the
bike is the same if you you were on

377
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,879
driving driving with you would still hit
it and but the machine with problem if

378
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,529
you learned the machine to hit the bikes
you should drive like that to hit other

379
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:43,530
things other obstacles then it would hit
also but I

380
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:48,870
think it will be very very precise in
what is doing in the next 20 to 30 or 40

381
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:54,960
years i think those algorithms will be
very good very efficient in that way to

382
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,240
know what to do and what do not do maybe
better than us we could be drunk we

383
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,640
could be stone we could do whatever we
can we can we can do shit

384
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,049
the computer doesn't know what drunk
means and I don't think you have a

385
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:14,010
consciousness by then so yeah

386
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:23,579
start what

387
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:35,489
on

388
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,930
situation just

389
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:49,098
that's the question ok right on the road
to bikers given up by now ok glass from

390
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:51,349
the program

391
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:56,329
yeah that's the whole point of the
machine learning they created the back

392
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:59,030
where they'll test how people react

393
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:06,920
yeah yeah the people i mean the whole
idea of those kind of computational

394
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,619
things is to teach the computer how how
you would behave and how you work so

395
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:25,940
look at the bigger picture if all the
cars yourself driving and in our system

396
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,550
then probably wouldn't happen the answer
this is a small problem there will be

397
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:34,670
one guy buy drugs from everybody

398
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,180
around all the cars that were

399
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:48,040
like if you have a truck and your self
driving cars Boston behind them there's

400
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:53,680
a small child playing behind the truck
and there's no sensor tell you that

401
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,859
there's a car coming there's a keep
their but if the others are other cars

402
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:09,790
are communicating and then you would
know your car but keep their yeah yeah i

403
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:15,670
mean my opinion and this technology and
the moral implications is this is a good

404
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:21,099
technology is something that will
definitely change the the way people

405
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:24,099
live in and I can explain why i say that

406
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,089
how many of you own the car

407
00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:36,970
ok so right for you how many hours per
day to use the car i know i use it for

408
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:44,379
less than half an hour might my office
is 15 minutes walking distance so my

409
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:49,480
cards three minutes and if i use it so
it's less than half an hour per day so

410
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:54,970
my car is sitting in front of my house
or my office for twenty three and half

411
00:37:54,970 --> 00:38:03,549
hours per day and I think that because i
bought the car and i'm not using it and

412
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:08,619
that's why i'm saying that it will
change the way people function if we

413
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:15,580
have intelligent cars or autonomous cars
i can summon a car whenever I needed and

414
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:21,880
use it just to get from point A to point
B and that's it i pay for that I don't

415
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,470
pay for for the car sitting in front of
my house for 23 and a half hours and

416
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:32,560
that that was really change that things
that will it will change the philosophy

417
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:39,460
of owning something if you own a car are
you're probably use it as a time sharing

418
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:45,550
with other people there always will be
people who buy a car but but that's

419
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,910
different thing for a normal common
person that use the car to transport

420
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,700
from point A to point B

421
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:56,970
this this technology can really change
things if i can summon the car it comes

422
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:02,459
picks me up takes me wherever it should
som somebody who's near that . some of

423
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:07,140
it and it will be used for 24 hours per
day and that's the point

424
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:13,078
productivity to make something
productive on the whole life span of the

425
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,160
thing

426
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:31,589
yeah so yeah so the legal part to
legalize self-driving cars in a country

427
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:38,310
in what state is that here in serbia in
Europe and I know that they have some

428
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:43,140
states in the u.s. I guess yeah there's
not a three-state three states yet that

429
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:49,710
I'll where you could test it not
completely drive it I mean but works in

430
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:55,079
California you could actually drive use
the card in on that autopilot function

431
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:02,460
but in some other states you can use it
on some highways not everywhere but i

432
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,109
don't think that the legal part is that
problematic that will happen

433
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:12,630
I mean it's inevitable yeah I'm if you
have good lobby behind it i mean is

434
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,890
common factors enter that into staying
there entering their following tests

435
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:22,710
they're following google if they answer
that industry the legal part we happenin

436
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,490
I don't hear too that's not provide they
have very strong lobbies they have

437
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:33,689
they've put a lot of cash into
especially us so that we just be to make

438
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,450
a law that Walter registration at it
will work

439
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:41,220
I don't think that the legal part will
be problematic as everything else so

440
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:55,120
just like if my car like Tesla or Google
kill someone but what about

441
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,170
responsibility

442
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,530
how can I explain that was card that was
me

443
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:05,710
yeah that's something that i don't think
anyone is thinking that much at this

444
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:11,860
moment that's very important thing are
but you know when the plane crash

445
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,340
you don't actually know if the pilot was
in command of the autopilot and they

446
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,860
always say it's like human error

447
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:22,000
maybe the the pilot could do something
but it was on autopilot

448
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:29,200
why didn't they react so I think there's
yeah and that more away

449
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,720
well we'll have to develop systems were
we did it by knowing where we know what

450
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,950
happened really

451
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:40,569
and we can do that by logging all the
data we know if the driver was sleeping

452
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:45,700
well you shouldn't be sleeping will know
probably if we could change something is

453
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:51,220
he could react and not if he didn't
react then it it is really his fault

454
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,870
I mean so I think there will be some
developments on that issue in the future

455
00:41:55,870 --> 00:42:01,450
10 15 20 years when this becomes
mainstream well I think we'll the

456
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:08,049
humanity will surely have some answers
from that okay I have a question

457
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:14,920
yep and it is about well in my opinion
the greatest obstacle about something

458
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:20,530
cars is that it is impossible that every
car in the world becomes celebrating

459
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:26,290
that would be the easiest thing possible
for the software and about the

460
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:29,290
capability of the cars

461
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:36,790
how about implementing the the system
used in bitcoins so in bitcoins every

462
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:42,520
computer in the world that uses bitcoins
and then that has a Bitcoin wallet is

463
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:47,710
synchronized and they all had to have to
agree unanimously on the

464
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:53,950
on the flow of the bitcoins so what
about to to protect yourself from

465
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:57,098
hackers trying to attack your car

466
00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:03,700
what about the in the solar cluster of
people using the same unanimous

467
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:08,500
yeah but software what will happen if
your car at that point is not connected

468
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,540
to the influence you will not be able to
start it so I i can connect I can hack a

469
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:19,180
car by passing by that car and looking
for its bluetooth or Wi-Fi i don't have

470
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:23,560
to be connected to the internet to
connect that car i can connect directly

471
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,880
by standing next to the car but if the
whole system is synchronized in the

472
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:33,580
Bitcoin way then if I lose connectivity
in my car for some reasons i probably

473
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:37,270
wouldn't be able to start it right
because that people need to check

474
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:42,970
something on other computers and to pull
that data back and start the car but

475
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:46,480
that would be the the safest option
would be definitely it would be unsafe

476
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,170
to study to even start the car even if
there are no cameras in the world

477
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:54,849
yeah i-i've right yeah i think that will
be the safest way i don't i don't think

478
00:43:54,849 --> 00:44:01,030
that we are possible because people be
enraged because they lose connectivity

479
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:04,030
and they cannot start the car but that
would be definitely the safest way

480
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:09,700
toward hacking in bitcoins are in that
we're not hackable

481
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:19,210
thank you yeah so you didn't mention
uber who is also developing half of

482
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:25,960
yourself driving programs quite and they
require auto yeah so I wanted to ask you

483
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:32,020
do you think that the future of
autonomous cars is dyed to ride hailing

484
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,339
and sharing economy because you
mentioned something like I think it is i

485
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:41,619
actually think this guy i think that at
that point where you don't need thrown a

486
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:47,800
car that we're going to that point I
really believe that because if the car

487
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,050
is smart enough to come when I needed

488
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:56,290
why would I don't it then i would ask
Michael ok Wilbur is uber is trying to

489
00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:00,710
lure has a bit different interests in
that because

490
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:04,940
he just want to push out drivers because
drivers are burden for them currently

491
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,460
taking care of a cheaper service

492
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,970
yeah they will have a cheaper service
they wouldn't have problems that for

493
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:15,230
example California where even that
you're not even if you're a contractor

494
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:21,680
the government in California says that
you are employed by by Auburn has to pay

495
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,879
your pension and everything else so I
think they're there they're interesting

496
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,910
too that is to load the cost of their
service

497
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:35,299
I don't think that they have that idea
as your mask does because you're masking

498
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,280
his light latest big plan

499
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:44,030
I he revealed that he wants to create
completely on the last test flower you

500
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:47,780
can just use it when you need it and
everything else so I think he has better

501
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:53,869
intentions of doing that then then uber
is but still yeah whatever is investing

502
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:58,760
a lot of money they are they acquired
the company that does that and they made

503
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,990
a partnership with Carnegie Mellon
University to help us

504
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:07,580
self-driving cars so that they'll
probably be the first that we used in

505
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:14,330
mass because it's cheaper but Tesla
liking create the barrier system or or

506
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,339
George hot

507
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:25,609
hello about your opinion that these
internal things will make cars hackable

508
00:46:25,609 --> 00:46:31,190
the story and we have already had a
couple cars especially if you buy you

509
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:37,700
expensive car it will have a black box
with GPS and everything so the insurance

510
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:44,000
company can always see where you are to
prevent theft and also in the next

511
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,260
versions this big boxes will be able to
disable the car on the will of the

512
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,810
insurance companies or the police

513
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:58,609
it's already measured i already watched
the on I think few weeks ago in the u.s.

514
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:03,140
you know the the whole economic crisis
of 2008 there was like mortgage and you

515
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:08,420
bought out she didn't have income
nowadays there's car loan bubble that's

516
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,280
going to happen and

517
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,530
mortgage companies that give you carlos
they have a black box and if you late

518
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:20,180
one day with payment they disable your
car and you can operate on and beeps

519
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:26,330
every and the day before the payment it
beeps every five seconds and day after

520
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:27,590
you cannot use it

521
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:33,710
yeah and the other thing about a moral
question the self learning system how do

522
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:39,620
you think this will be put in in
production i would say in my company you

523
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,880
have to have a driving license as a
human if you want to control a car do

524
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:50,420
you mean this teach the system should
make something like a driving license it

525
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:56,180
can be done by simulation or something
like this would not be a solution

526
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:03,319
I i read somewhere that kids born in
this year we'll probably not have a

527
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:11,270
driver's license so they'll do not know
how to drive a car so i guess a system

528
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:19,190
or what will be created by that point
when those kids grow up they were that

529
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:23,180
the only thing they don't know will be
driverless cars and they would not know

530
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,440
how to drive

531
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:30,500
maybe you create the system where we
teach them how to react in some some

532
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,070
situations for example if you have to
press the brake

533
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:37,640
where is the break and if you have to
move the steering wheel move the

534
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:43,970
steering wheel or I don't know press the
command on the screen it will change as

535
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:48,680
time progresses of the I i really
believe that you have to have some form

536
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:54,799
of license for I don't know not only but
driving in the car

537
00:48:55,310 --> 00:49:00,650
that's autonomous at least I don't know
first date I mean things can happen so

538
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:05,330
you have to know how to react on
different things but i don't think the

539
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:09,560
driver license will stay from much long
maybe it will be like for one volunteer

540
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:14,029
if you want to drive the story from
mighty it is you will have to have a

541
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:17,720
driver's license but if you want to go
to work by driving the car you don't

542
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,959
know

543
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,770
the car get right okay

544
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:40,240
well well everyone is doing that form of
analyzing the date that they get from

545
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:46,000
all the other cars they have on the
streets so you when this come to mass

546
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,990
production

547
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:51,310
you'll probably have a good good
starting point on how to the positives

548
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:57,549
the car to behave what to do i think
that computing power and everything is

549
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:05,109
like rising very quickly and you
everyday you can process more and more

550
00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:10,359
videos of what cars are doing in the
complete set of data so at that point

551
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:15,069
you probably have very good starting
point when you buy the car it will not

552
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:22,750
make a collision or something like that
and about like the legal aspect of that

553
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:27,339
car are i'm not sure how that's gonna
work but you'll probably have to

554
00:50:27,339 --> 00:50:32,980
register it as you do with the normal
car but it will have some different

555
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:36,339
forms of ownership I don't know that
work

556
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:44,890
what about Warner abilities so what
about water abilities since every

557
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:48,069
software hardware Warner ability is
something that cannot be patched

558
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:54,310
immediately so if you have a really
critical exploit on the cars if all of

559
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:58,960
the cars are in use like self-driving
cars

560
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:05,500
what would happen to the whole of the
world if track cars

561
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,700
yeah of course suddenly need to stop
because of a critical scratch that that

562
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:14,470
that that the whole point of the heck
ability of things that are connected to

563
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:21,009
the internet that it would crash you
cannot about everything is hackable

564
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:27,820
definitely everything can be hacked you
cannot protect enough are so this is

565
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:31,750
probably the biggest pitfall of this
technology is reset is that capability

566
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:36,670
if you would have the whole system
though every car would crash that

567
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:42,680
obvious and people since it takes time
to catch something which is yeah i mean

568
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,520
at that point two seconds is much

569
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:51,860
yeah so you have children you don't have
you cannot have the system that that

570
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:56,150
have holes in it and that that is quite
impossible to have the system that not

571
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:01,430
not wearable to hacking is I sorry for
interrupting but is somebody connecting

572
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:07,850
the self matching AI systems and some
driving cars that would be a really good

573
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:12,140
connection between the yeah i think it
would be that would be the ideal case

574
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:15,560
but then probably at some point the car
will kill you

575
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:21,560
I mean that's if you have that kind of
consciousness that it knows where it's

576
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:26,930
not good at and where it's good that
probably that that rise of the machines

577
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:28,460
and that's it

578
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:34,700
artificial intelligence that wouldn't
like you all to summon him when he wants

579
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,839
to I don't know being standby mode or
something i don't know i i'd i don't

580
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,710
think i'm adding and I'm not thinking
about like relay I or something like

581
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:43,130
that

582
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:49,040
I'm thinking about the I don't know if
you heard about that the competitions on

583
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,259
like capture the flag type of thing on
virtual hosts which are targeting each

584
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,870
other and self patching themselves

585
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:02,359
no I did I mean that kind of a project
connected with the self-driving car that

586
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,410
might be a real benefits to this yeah
probably somebody in the world is

587
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:09,569
thinking about how to do self patching

588
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:15,750
on this I mean did that the same thing
as airplanes airplanes had to be 10

589
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:21,390
times safer then then then cars i mean
in the cards like four people in their

590
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:27,690
present these two other 50 so but still
people are hacking airplanes even that

591
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:33,030
that's very high and very hard to do
that there's no not so much

592
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:39,630
options for connectivity to an airplanes
system but still they do it so it would

593
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:46,320
be cool to self patch but I don't know
how quick that will that will be i don't

594
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,740
know i i'm not i'm not into that topic
so i don't know much about it but

595
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,740
probably somebody's already thinking
about it I guess

596
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:57,330
yeah

597
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,320
any more questions

598
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,100
ok thank you guys for your time
