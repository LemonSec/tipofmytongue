1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:25,169
first of all welcome to the balcony
again and this is gonna be my second

2
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:32,430
talk engineer which is in Balcombe i did
make a talking last year about again a

3
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,910
close to this topic but in a different
way this time I'm just going to focus on

4
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:43,440
some JavaScript way how to do a control
not some normal programs or have to

5
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,399
control some hardware in basics so I
hope you're gonna enjoy it if I make any

6
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,090
mistakes . by please bear with me this
is programmers always we can just you

7
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,559
know I failed

8
00:00:52,559 --> 00:01:02,099
that's normal so anyway so today's uh
this in this event i'm just going to

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,930
talk about how to control hardware and
stuff but before that I just want to

10
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,440
give some information about what's this
JavaScript think on what the notch is

11
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,679
and how do we use it how do you install
it and how do you you know do some stuff

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,400
with it because most of in web
developers and other people know

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,909
JavaScript the most likely i think
everyone is here I think know what the

14
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,890
JavaScript this and you know in a mean
of it and and if you don't know

15
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,950
okay this is good then maybe I can teach
something alright so there is also a

16
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,820
other perspective of this presentation
which is about little bit I odds but i'm

17
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,740
not going to go that that deep because
it's entirely another topic we can talk

18
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:58,350
about like another two hours which is I
don't want to just bore people so what

19
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:06,509
is the notch is what is this programming
language things the gave gave us this it

20
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:13,019
is it said javascript it's working on a
chrome engine and it's likely it's very

21
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:16,180
nice efficient you can just install

22
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,909
your own package or someone else package
which using NPM it just depend on not GS

23
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:26,980
so if you don't have to chase it won't
work and as a fedora we love not cheese

24
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,060
use it if you want to install it just do
this command line on the you know the

25
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,159
presentation or you can use your you
know own distribution or operation

26
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,840
systems depend on you can install it

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,780
it's easy and I'll of documentation of
it because it's really clear and you can

28
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,790
just take a look there it's not some
sort of all you know blog things it's

29
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,290
very light and efficient so use it and
of course if you try to develop

30
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,269
something please in user mode

31
00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:00,189
I mean do not just you know it use root
all the time because there is some sort

32
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:04,629
of security issues we don't like it and
i hope you just get the point of it

33
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:13,569
so how do you use a this not jas it's
very very simple

34
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:17,409
so if i want to show you that let's just
go there just exit out

35
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:24,940
ok so just open up terminal ok

36
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,920
alright I just need some simple terminal
so when you install energy is all you

37
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,920
have to do is just a okay is it oh it's
sketch what we have to do this time okay

38
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:46,869
so everyone can see it is it ok ok yeah
i have to be done to change just like to

39
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,870
score this

40
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,680
let's just do this

41
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,030
ok

42
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,050
stop

43
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:10,380
big enough okay well so when you type
this you just the diversion of the not

44
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,970
just what we have in federal or in this
is also a long-term version so it is

45
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,720
this table 1 and if you check the NPR
version this is what it is and if you

46
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,880
want to run something on my GS

47
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,110
it's very simple all you have to do is
to create the javascript file that if i

48
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,210
do this like simple test file let's just
say and let's say i wanna try something

49
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,830
on it like you know some very simple
stuff very basic nothing fancy

50
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,960
let's say hello done we can to save it

51
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:49,530
oh okay if I went to wrong just run and
talking very simple it's nothing too

52
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:57,630
complicated so you know it just how to
run the chairs so you don't need any web

53
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,680
browser you don't need any kind of
external application you just need more

54
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,810
chairs you can run it but if you wanna
run something up that way if you want to

55
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:12,000
run something on your web browser you're
gonna need some tools and that tools

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,550
will be going to use on you know on your
web browser which is it's a library

57
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,760
simply and you can just get it from the
not chairs

58
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:26,010
thankfully and you can just use it on
your javascript file and then you run it

59
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,539
it's going to only show you the
client-side your server side which is

60
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,050
your court when i'm in the background so
nobody see your what is what what did

61
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,730
you type it they just going to see the
result of it so it can work as a server

62
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,540
side it can also Morgan client-side it
just depends on you how to program it

63
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:49,590
and it's very easy so about some basics
of not just normally I want to talk that

64
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,060
much i'm just going to show it

65
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,890
how's it gonna go but what can we do
what can be done so in basics

66
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:02,789
it's very simple let me just go back to
my terminal again and let me just change

67
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,920
something for you

68
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,510
ok

69
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:16,990
yeah

70
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:24,640
so uh about some little simple basics we
have if you if you just take a look like

71
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,360
some basics call of it but let's just
let's just do a little bit better let's

72
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,010
just do some colorful way just so far
it's not just bring us out just let us

73
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,420
change it with color and let's to this
way

74
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,900
ok this is I think better gonna be yep

75
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,669
ok this and yeah I think

76
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,360
yep this is I think better just more
easy so as I just thought that it was

77
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,740
just a simple way how to just output
your console how to type in not chairs

78
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:59,590
but if you know all the JavaScript and
you can just type your codes and just

79
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:05,229
run it on you know what she is but if
you wanna do a you know something extra

80
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:10,660
like some variables and stuff like that
you can do that too and it's kinda like

81
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,660
this that just showed up

82
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:25,800
ok alright fine so let me just minimize
it a little bit so some little example

83
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,170
nothing so nothing fancy so if you know
already

84
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,669
javascript which is the same rule
applies you can just you know put your

85
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:42,420
rivals like ABC a whatever you want you
can just did something to equalize it

86
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,280
and you can just call some built-in
function like date you can use the you

87
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,119
know some if statement for statement
while statement whatever you want you

88
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,410
can just call out and just our prophet
in your terminal as you can see it's

89
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,330
very easy very basics

90
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,409
it's gonna learn something more there is
some nice website of it you can just go

91
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,100
there and do that first and if you
already know it done you can just jump

92
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,590
in the advanced part and just do your
work

93
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:15,840
it's very very simple and very efficient
and my slide is always going back

94
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:25,530
I don't know why ok so about some
electronics and about a little bit io so

95
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:33,179
relationship with not jess is if you
want to control your hardware we have to

96
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:38,549
connect some protocols we have to use
some sort of connection method it will

97
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:45,300
allow to control our devices so if you
want to connect your basic software like

98
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,270
some arduino or raspberry pi or
BeagleBone or your quadrant captured or

99
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:56,160
if you made something maybe something
unique and you choose some way to

100
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,339
control of it it's the Sun it's the one
of the example actually is a general

101
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:07,470
waste of the controller because it is i
don't know better ways to control it so

102
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:15,120
we have spi ic2 and serial port and i
think most of us know how to control

103
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,220
serial port because it's the basics of
basics of the hardware control because

104
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,100
if you any

105
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,890
if you try any of our Dominion types it
will just give you do how to connect

106
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:34,410
with them which is serial port and it
just allowed to you get the output what

107
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,730
you did in your code if you have a
serial terminal and it just shows the

108
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:44,850
result of it but let's say you want to
control some motors and you want to

109
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,780
control like a multiple of it then
you're gonna need something extra and in

110
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:55,290
this matter i'm using ic2 because I its
really nice just to cable can be

111
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,699
connected like up if I have a support on
my chip which is also depend on your

112
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,740
hardware i can just connect
ten-thousands motors in one device with

113
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,760
the two cable i just need to write the
address list and i can just control it

114
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,319
which is very nice

115
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,860
so if you something more smart like a
embedded computers like a bigger bone or

116
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:23,640
something like that you can use a web
server and set and you can also use this

117
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,710
method with your serial connection you
can combine with time so in locally you

118
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,810
can use your computer as a communication
method with our website and in the

119
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:40,260
behind your hardware can be communicated
with this one of the protocols or if you

120
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,939
have industrial protocols if you try any
you can use that one too and it's very

121
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:54,660
easy very basics and also there is some
open wrt rod routers and microchips

122
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:01,260
well it's kind of tricky to do this but
or on open wrt I can see there is some

123
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,480
way of the notch is support but you have
to compile it yourself so it's not easy

124
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,610
you also need external hardware and
storage to do this so be careful with it

125
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:18,480
so about these two guys these two guys
is allowed to you control both

126
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,520
connection independent address list if
you want to control your hardware with

127
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,620
the not jas you should you should know
what is this force so it's a multiplexer

128
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,900
can be analog can be digital

129
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,069
also you can determine each address on
depend on your library so

130
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:42,960
which means you have to know your
address later on your data shit and your

131
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,160
hardware needs to be supported or it
doesn't have any support you have to do

132
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,100
with yourself because I mean think about
this there is a a lot soft device a lot

133
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,490
of chip involved because you know 2016
and there is no general library to

134
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:04,140
control all of the hardware at once and
if there is any I mean I want to see

135
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,980
what kind of side is going to be just a
billion offline of corn and it's not a

136
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:14,190
reliable solution so it's also depend on
what hardware use of it so you have to

137
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:19,050
check isn't supported on no Jess library
system or not if it is how do I control

138
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:24,180
it that some questions we need to ask
ourselves when we can continue so as an

139
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:32,219
example this is a device are used before
it's working on not jas it's easy so I

140
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:38,400
check it myself before i start my
project so this guy is Mark on I see to

141
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,230
it that is a 16-channel and I know what
the specific is its controlling for

142
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,540
motors which i use it and need some
soldiering need some job which is this

143
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:54,810
is normal and there's a library so i can
install this library like npm install

144
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:00,390
and they give the name of the library
and it will work and give me the result

145
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:07,050
of the library and I can use it on my
project and control my hardware and I

146
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:13,380
can go on and go on so it is nice but
it's only work on this chip i can use

147
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:20,820
nothing else and the nothing i can do an
extra just have to know this is for this

148
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,780
and yeah but if you add something your
own if you modify it

149
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:30,900
yes you can use it and if you want to
see some example it's kinda like this as

150
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,270
you can see we have to get this code
line before we have to try to use it so

151
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:42,990
I just let's say I install it and have
to require this this part of this first

152
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,380
two line which is three let me just do
this okay

153
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:53,040
so these two line is allow me to control
IC two protocols and this is my chip and

154
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,540
then just open my address my frequency I
have to know it from my dad shit

155
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,670
it is kind of technical but it's a hard
way so then when i get my result its

156
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,779
carrier testing

157
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:10,769
ok then i'm connected so what can I do i
can send my PM control my pulse my

158
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:17,160
address and i can just turn around and
do my stuff which is very easy but it's

159
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,379
changing for each hardware and each type
of device so you have to be careful with

160
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:29,850
it and this is also a serial port which
is it just also a general way to

161
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:34,350
communicate you just need to know what
the device on it is so the address i

162
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:45,419
mean is let me just wrap up okay if i
open my terminal ok

163
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:56,510
so i just plugged my arduino here so my
argument is right there right over there

164
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,370
is GTA AC this is my device I just
connected to here so i know that was the

165
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:07,070
address is so i can connect it with the
OGS way and control of it and when i get

166
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,960
the result i'm going to get some
information what I program inside of it

167
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:20,210
so i'm going to show you later on just
let us keep this way that moment okay

168
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,839
ok so how do you have probably control
it it's easy

169
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:35,950
the magical call is just get the library
called the function just type your bond

170
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,910
rate and your job or if you're in
McIntosh it's the same but different

171
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:44,199
linux is this way if you use windows or
something

172
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:51,160
it's a common 0123 for whatever it is
it's something and make sure your

173
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,209
permission because controlling input and
output device from your computer's is

174
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:59,560
required some administration right in
Linux which and we have a groups and if

175
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,270
i add myself to the group's I can
control of it but a in Windows and

176
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:08,500
Macintosh you need some require certain
stuff but i don't know exactly what is

177
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:17,649
so let's say the web browser on web
circuit this is also very nice things

178
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:23,050
because since we are in iOS world and
website world because everything is

179
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,800
going to club but they said industrial
level in code in also commercial level

180
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:34,990
so we knows the stuff we do we love to
stop in web so how do i do it in not

181
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:44,560
chess so it's how it is some ways not
just one way it's a it's a big answer I

182
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,609
can give it to you but i'm going to give
most known type of the way how do i do

183
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,630
it so let's just do it and see how it's
gonna go

184
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,360
so this is the court but I'm gonna just
show it published on

185
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:06,520
ok let's just go back go back nice
quotes I don't see anything in here that

186
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,520
just go back first and see

187
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,890
ok ok

188
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,780
so is this wrong item

189
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:26,670
alright so let me just open up please
give me a second okay this is the HTTP

190
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,170
webserver control way which is its
built-in in rjs you don't have to

191
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:35,940
install anything just tap your code no
installation required and this is how

192
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,720
you done just have to call the library
you need and just I just make my

193
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,300
constant and stuff like that and this is
my you know simple web browser called if

194
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,530
I just run it

195
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:57,510
let me just run it up by the way and if
I just feel ok alright so when i run it

196
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:02,370
as you can see it's it's working and
it's very basic web server so there's a

197
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,320
lot of course you see in the back line
but in here if you just inspect the

198
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:13,080
element its is it just a client-server
cycling clients that this disappeared so

199
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,820
there's no javascript it's just an HTML
nothing else it's clean and it's very

200
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,040
nice

201
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,520
so if I want to do something a little
bit nicer

202
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:30,030
there's also another way to do it which
is this is based on as Sinatra which is

203
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:35,070
Ruby web browser things but it's
different so this is what we this is a

204
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:40,950
calling express and experts is also an
external library on not just with very

205
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:46,950
famous if you want to control your you
know your web browser or sorry web

206
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:52,560
server with this it's also possible you
can also combine with the database and

207
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,960
other code course you want to do it we
can do it so let me just run it this one

208
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,090
ok

209
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,070
and I have to just kill this one post

210
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,100
ok

211
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,539
let's say I want around my expert serve
when i try it

212
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:25,830
yes ok so this is a the express this is
also a web server system its little bit

213
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:30,090
tinier so the code line is not longer as
i did before

214
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,530
it's just like a a couple of lines like
a tan lines

215
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:39,629
this one is a little bit longer but it
has a built-in library so this guys is

216
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,280
expresses just change it

217
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,210
something's become you know easier to
access it for us so we can just just go

218
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,809
with it and use library and if you want
to do you wanna take a look

219
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,419
as you can see i just need to call
express and do my stuff so the last line

220
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:57,929
and the first line is just because i
want to run automatically firefox just

221
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:01,799
open up in the rep you know when the men
in the window that it just doesn't

222
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:06,059
matter at the moment just for this
presentation so nothing else

223
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:12,960
ok

224
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,000
ok so wait what

225
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:28,150
so this is as I said it's just a
built-in function it's just HTTP run

226
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:32,590
your code and you have to just you know
call of this study will see the content

227
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,810
hello everything must be done by
manually an express it's like just like

228
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:43,419
this that's all in the very basics of
HTTP and express there is so many

229
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,000
difference between them and it's short

230
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,780
well documented and it's always active
project and i like it so about an

231
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,040
industrial ways

232
00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:00,159
ok if any of you know about building
automation and how our systems any of

233
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,660
you

234
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:07,630
ok good as him personally so this
protocol is no I think about it you know

235
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,800
you heard of some of it

236
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,510
magnetin modbus yeah if you want to
control some big hardware like a not

237
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:19,660
just be talking about tiny home stuff we
talking about some air conditioning

238
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:24,250
system hold this building and heating
system cooling system water system a lot

239
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:30,700
of stuff depend on how big your project
is so this guy is this protocols is the

240
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,010
doorway but it's very nice

241
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:38,830
we can do it not just to we can control
our system with this waste of the way

242
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:44,110
but it's really really complex that I
just don't like you know just show up

243
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,729
the whole a line because you have to
know all the protocols what it is but I

244
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,880
just wanna get some information it's
also possible if any of you interested

245
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,919
you can take a look on

246
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,600
the notch is library which is NP MGS you
can see which protocols is supportive

247
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,769
which is not if you like it you can use
it but it's always welcome to develop

248
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:12,619
and add something more so about let's
just say about the ok this is bobby way

249
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:16,070
this is like if you have some tiny
device like Arden you're okay

250
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:21,830
this project is your way so it also
meant to be any robotics to about

251
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:29,989
nigeria's a about not read we need we
have some charts and visual stuff it's

252
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:35,119
kind of advanced controlling and it's
give you some nicely you know graphical

253
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:41,988
interface allows you to control your any
application any hardware with it you

254
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:46,070
just have to just you know jack and drop
and let me just shove it

255
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,600
let me run it from here to here

256
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,430
okay all i did is i just type not read
and if i go to the website there is its

257
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,450
drawing me which web server is running
if you don't believe me

258
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:10,300
as you can see it's going at the moment
is this port and this website just did

259
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,139
just enough

260
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:20,620
yep okay . and i have to go out a little
bit mini-me minimizes this one it's not

261
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,129
working

262
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:29,800
just let me just fix it please ok oh
sorry sorry about it

263
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:35,539
oh ok

264
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,539
I can just adjust to it near place first

265
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:47,989
okay Coco so as you can see this is not
read this is meant to be in IO project

266
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:52,399
on robotics project if you want it is
your function and call box we can just

267
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:58,219
check and drop and just do your input to
your staff and when you done you can

268
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,840
deploy it and deployment is based on the
embedded device and this is a normal

269
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,029
computer so I can I cannot just deploy
it at the moment so I just going to show

270
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,479
up

271
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:15,619
how's it done and its really nice is
it's also a no packaging for fedora

272
00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:20,719
it's almost be completed so in federal
25 I guess we're going to have this

273
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,549
package you can just install very easily
and use it on your embedded devices and

274
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:31,609
your iOS devices so a pilot project is
also working on federal too so if you

275
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:36,889
have federal Atomics and something like
that you can just deploy your operating

276
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:41,928
system and your hardware soft hardware
software on it and can just run whatever

277
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:44,749
you want it just really really nice

278
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:52,429
Lee preparing so yeah I'm just go here

279
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
yeah

280
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,850
right

281
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:13,000
and I just go too much okay good so
about cyclone GS is also met about

282
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,789
cyclones is also another project is for
robotics and it's also very easy to use

283
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:23,559
it and if you want to use it to install
NPM install cyclone and if you want to

284
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:28,720
install globally it's also just need a G
and joining five gold and other stuff is

285
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,120
also same way you can control your
hardware's like a I mean there's a lot

286
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,870
of hardware you know you know if you
hear about it like army europe in the

287
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:43,239
most and raspberry pi and other i'll
either embedded device like a BeagleBone

288
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:50,169
a pine shape or your quadcopter it's
entirely up to you you can control with

289
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:54,850
this libraries there is some nice
support on it and you can simply use it

290
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,840
so I'm gonna have an interview in here
i'm just going to control my argument

291
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:08,649
with the cyclone and let me just show up
very quickly then just go here clean up

292
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,650
some

293
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,150
ok

294
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,150
yep

295
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,030
yep ok

296
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:33,180
alright so as you can see i just run my
command but let's just do it again just

297
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,920
terminated

298
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,930
ok just this is the command let me open
the camera also so you can't see it

299
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,630
video

300
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:53,070
yes ok alright let's go to you so I'll
get

301
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:56,370
yeah

302
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:59,669
ok ok everybody sit

303
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:04,800
ok so let's just do this one pretty here

304
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:12,720
ok so if I just rolled in the camera as
you can see i just tried to control the

305
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,910
LED from right here so I installed my
frame air in it and it's as you can see

306
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:24,240
it's just you know blinking it is in two
seconds and it's working easily and this

307
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,320
is very basic of the cyclone jest you
can just use any other device control

308
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,610
more than more than more and try to give
the basics so it lets the opposite come

309
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,050
down it's very nice

310
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:41,490
also let's go on this up so this is my
project

311
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:50,910
yeah so I just connect my device to the
my USB and all i have to do is just call

312
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:56,010
my library which is this cyclone and
cyclone is recognized everything as a

313
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:00,480
robot because it's meant to be robotics
you can just call your port on your

314
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,580
adapter and drivers and your device is
what are you going to control it you

315
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,620
want to control motors or something else
depend on you and you can just do it in

316
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,790
to second millisecond depend on what i'm
going to do in my function and then just

317
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:20,550
start it up and use it and that's all
it's very basics and very easy if you

318
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:24,780
want to have something more complex and
something else because research on it

319
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:30,660
and do your own magical device it's
entirely up to you so but how do i

320
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,520
install this and control it

321
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:39,210
let me just create another project for
you in basics way okay

322
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:46,370
alright so first things first I needed
to utilize my project let me just do

323
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:50,268
this one also it's asking for what's
going to be name is just going to skip

324
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:52,940
this one but it vastly ok

325
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,929
the project is done so i need to know
what I'm going to install it

326
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:03,559
I'm going to install my cyclone and i'm
also used a fear matter which is the

327
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:07,399
device is already installed i need this
one and also i need some other stuff

328
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:13,070
which is required for this and then i
would like to say this libraries in my

329
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:17,750
working folders are it's going to
calling out automatically and I can use

330
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,529
it

331
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:24,350
I'm just install it by the way it's also
solving dependencies so i don't have to

332
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:29,570
do anything else and it just installed
as you can see i just want to install a

333
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:34,549
cyclone but it also installed as you can
see other stuff like here as you can see

334
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:39,110
serial port fuel matter and others so
the good part of the nbme it's solving

335
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,879
dependency automatically so you don't
have to deal with this problem so they

336
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,740
can I see what I just type it in in the
same as you can see my dependencies is

337
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:53,029
here so I know these dependencies has
been saved in here and if anyone else

338
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:58,760
want to use my project it can just type
npm install like this and it will going

339
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,500
to just check the which packages needed
but let's say I just like the package so

340
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,500
i want to install from remote

341
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:16,890
yep and as you can see it just checked
the file the which is the JSON file and

342
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:22,650
get the library is needed and it's going
to be done so then i have to create my

343
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:29,640
javascript file I just do this and like
my project what I'm going to do is show

344
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,480
it later before and I just have to run
it and it's gonna be completed

345
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,240
ok

346
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,360
yeah

347
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:55,059
ok but we just don't have our division
stuff we have a lots of different

348
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:58,629
libraries you can use on your other
project if you want to control Bluetooth

349
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:03,520
you can use bluetooth control if you
want to use some image processing some

350
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,230
opencv project you can use this one if
you want to control the Raspberry Pi yes

351
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,620
or if you're very kind of a keyboard
mouse joystick whatever you want to

352
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,209
control its already prepared and you
just have to go to the website and just

353
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:23,500
take it and it's done it easy about
resources and which website is I use it

354
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,220
and check it out

355
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,360
it is the website lists i recommended
for you if you want to go about go check

356
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,110
it and and learn about more robotics and
stuff like that

357
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,830
not just is already known things to just
stop the google it and this is the

358
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:43,210
hardware part for how to control the
stuff i mean you know and i think i'm

359
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:47,559
just going a little bit too fast and if
you have any questions please welcome in

360
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:50,559
the end I'm assault that's all for me

361
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:03,350
ok any questions anything about
something I think nothing

362
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,970
please yes

363
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:14,630
you just have to do is let's say you're
on federal or debian on federal benefits

364
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:22,730
. g is an NPM done and just continue on
recipe on if you wanna know about it up

365
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:30,890
to get installed same idea applies but
you can also use nvm which is let me

366
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:38,000
show up which is this is what i'm doing
right now at the moment

367
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,360
ok there is something we call nvm which
is I install it on

368
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:50,149
nvm you can control multiple version of
the not jazz and install any version you

369
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:55,280
like to do so you don't need the package
manager to you can do this way so if i

370
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:02,540
installed like version 4.5 . one if I
might say just click it if it is there .

371
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,620
so if it's not

372
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,639
yep it's not funded let's say one is the
latest so which is stable version

373
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,760
yep it's a it's all things that only
after the switch diversion and you're

374
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,360
going to get the result if I want to
switch and all i have to do is check

375
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,399
what I have out sorry about this

376
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:28,580
yep i have version 6.5 and 4.5 so I just
can't switch between down and install it

377
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:34,580
in the device i want to as long as your
average system exactly you have your

378
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,970
your own virtual environment and
isolated you can just install other

379
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:43,490
libraries to there and there because
sometimes type libraries didn't update

380
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:47,870
himself to the latest version and if
something is deprecated or change it so

381
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:51,169
you should be no aware of but you can
use of it that this is the best way to

382
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:55,910
test of it no problem and else

383
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,760
oh ok

384
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,240
actually nothing else left ok thank you
and thank you again
