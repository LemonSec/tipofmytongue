1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:26,830
hello everyone please welcome our next
guest animated he'll tell us about

2
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:37,899
exploring IOT attacks his money so hello
everyone I'm done making sunday i'll be

3
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:43,179
talking about the exploration of the IOT
attack surface i come from a little town

4
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:47,980
in the north of gracious cold virus
didn't wear my faculty where I work is

5
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:53,620
located and I had the open systems and
security lab there we mostly house they

6
00:00:53,620 --> 00:01:03,549
say concentrate on the offensive part of
the information security business first

7
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:09,430
I have to like thank my sponsors usually
it goes my research is sponsored in part

8
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,470
of in part by the creation Science
Foundation which is a pretty good deal

9
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,820
because we have a research project an IT
security and they pay for the hardware

10
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,660
which is always cool if you're
interested into the scientific part of

11
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:28,420
it you can visit IOT . for the HR which
will pretty much take you to our page

12
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,650
for the Internet of Things
interoperability project which were

13
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,670
doing with a lot of our things security
is just part of it

14
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,260
so if you're interested in IOT in
research being me

15
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,990
we can probably collaborate so the first
question is which is now of course not a

16
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,920
good time to ask it but why should you
listen to me and not go for coffee

17
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,990
monday or beer

18
00:01:52,990 --> 00:02:01,030
well currently there is a large amount
of IOT gadgets charity things from

19
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:07,120
amazon at home to the next quadcopter or
internet-connected buggy throw

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,280
everything that works pretty much in the
gnu/linux or a version of Android and

21
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,460
believe it or not we got the nineties of
infosec back so it was all like

22
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,330
they're saying the nineties we had all
kinds of bugs you can pretty much find

23
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:28,210
abilities everywhere you can have that
today if you just go into IOT if you

24
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,840
want to like a official definition what
Internet of Things this

25
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,590
well it would say something like
Internet of Things is the network of

26
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,990
physical objects devices vehicles
buildings anything that's embedded with

27
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:46,900
electronics software sensors network
connectivity that enables to collect an

28
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,660
exchange data which pretty much means
that if there are something that people

29
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,829
do they'll try to connect everything to
the Internet including this premium

30
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,840
things like you have toilet seats that
have bluetooth that are I be connected

31
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,040
so you don't have to press the button
but you can simply swap from using

32
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,150
Twitter to use their happen you can
watch yourself get warm get dried get

33
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,690
wiped everything it's interesting
because it also has a sound module

34
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:19,000
certain Reaper reproduce music on it
since it's pretty much IP connected

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,670
guess what happens there are some guys
that really bought this kind of stuff

36
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:31,750
and they started trying to hack it and
they pretty much acted to play all kinds

37
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,590
of stuff either stuff you don't want to
hear playing when you're on the toilet

38
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,880
seat or simply just spray water at you
at random and so on

39
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:46,900
well this is a fun example and pretty
much and how fun it would be from like I

40
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,150
be connected toilet seat assaulted you

41
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,190
but this is a little worse example so
it's from symantec because there are

42
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,650
android smart tvs and guess what

43
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,870
there are people who found out that well
people will most likely pay around some

44
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:07,690
for smart TV why because smart tvs are
kinda expensive and people don't like

45
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:14,800
using them losing them so we have TV
ransomware next thing is this little

46
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,470
thing I'm not the fitness aficionados
you can see from me but I got one of

47
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,310
those things just research well it does
what it has in it and the interesting

48
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,900
part was it has like a galvanic skin
response sensor it has it has a

49
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,919
heartbeat sensor

50
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,170
there's an accelerator so what it can
pretty much say to you is how many steps

51
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,460
have you taken and what's your heart
rate how well did you sleep did you

52
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,140
sleep in about like light sleep in deep
sleep when did you wake up how many

53
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:49,180
times you woke up during the day and
pretty much it's interesting because you

54
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,650
get your whole like biological
everything set on your cell phone

55
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,290
so that's awesome right so how many of
you when you buy the next cool gadget

56
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,570
connect that gadget for intercepting
proxy to see what does it send to where

57
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:10,960
anyone so you would say like yes I want
privacy please do not send any date a

58
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,190
blah blah and what happens is they were
saying like the matrix on the height

59
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:21,219
weight born resting heart rate heart
rate well on a like running up the

60
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,990
stairs amount of steps taken so it's
pretty much somebody in the clouds get

61
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,100
your whole biological clock knows how
many times you get woken up in the night

62
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:36,130
which pretty much means somebody can
pretty well have a good guess on how fit

63
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,680
you are or how not fit you are and
that's a that's a bad thing if you think

64
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,170
about it because currently it's it's
okay but if I tell you something like

65
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:53,620
you give them consent for monitoring of
data for selling of data and so on and

66
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,010
what happens is you want to get for
instance life insurance and they say no

67
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,130
no you're you're 20 too risky

68
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,900
well fine but what happens if they have
like use something like deploying data

69
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,359
mining and figure out that this person
might have a stroke in the next like six

70
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,640
months you can tell it by for certain
and then insurance company says you're

71
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,650
sorry we're canceling your insurance
because you're too not risky but we

72
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,630
can't sell insurance story by here's a
refund bye-bye then it starts getting

73
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,990
really interesting right so we have to
know that

74
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:35,058
as there was a quote in one movie i
think it was the social network 41

75
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:39,710
somebody said that the internet isn't
written in pencil it's written in ink

76
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,878
and that stuff you buy it and we'll
collect all kinds of biological data

77
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:50,599
from you so that's pretty nasty second
everybody loves the FBI and every other

78
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:55,610
trailer agency what happened was there
was like a an interesting part where the

79
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,649
FBI cannot neither confirm nor deny
virus type in your Amazon echo which is

80
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:04,909
a little Amazon spot gets so this is
kind of concerning but I was like they

81
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:06,619
had this can't be

82
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:10,789
and then i was reading my local news
which pretty much said that some guys

83
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:17,360
tried to rob a bank but they were caught
by spying on their smart TV in creation

84
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,529
hmm even more interesting right usually
did somebody with that their phone they

85
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:31,129
would have their house they say their
apartment but a smart TV is also free

86
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:38,449
game when you look at the ecosystem like
the whole IOT thingy ecosystem you have

87
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:44,089
a thing that's a physical like a sensor
a probe smart blog a smart light

88
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:48,949
anything it's connected to the network
or directly to the internet or it's

89
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:53,120
usually connected to some kind of a hub
of hubs like a central device that

90
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,589
connects all the devices like all the
smart lights in your house are connected

91
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:01,580
to one hub right so you can switch on
the lights on and off we are your cell

92
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,219
phone and do anything else there is
another thing called that's usually also

93
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:11,089
a broker you could be all kinds of
communication systems like Wi-Fi

94
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:19,249
Bluetooth low-energy XB whatever you
want pretty much and on network it's

95
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:25,639
mostly stuff called like MQTT like my
screen kilometer transport or ethernet

96
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,889
Wi-Fi which you all know if it's a
little because I say a heavier machine

97
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,880
it will pretty much speak HTTP so you
can know how to use

98
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:44,499
and there was a lot of research on IT
security one of it was done by I think

99
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:48,670
the HP and I are active

100
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:54,790
i'm not sure but almost irt top-10
pretty much you gave a list of top 10

101
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:00,699
like vulnerabilities entirety gadgets
the first place was insecure web

102
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:04,540
interfaces because most of that stuff
has a web interface you can manage it

103
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:10,719
and usually people that write embedded
software that the building better for

104
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,189
projects are not so good about
developers so they usually have a lot of

105
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:20,620
and abilities in the web interface
second is insufficient authentication

106
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,639
authorization

107
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,779
usually they are pre-installed user
accounts pre-installed certificates and

108
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:30,759
stuff like that which isn't helping
insecure network services you got for

109
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:36,100
instance you got SL that's old like
openssl some five-year-old version which

110
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,360
is pretty much vulnerable to every known
and unknown exploit which happened in

111
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,649
next five years

112
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:46,509
privacy concerns that just said one this
and everything to the cloud is secure

113
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:51,129
cloud interface this seven better
because usually when you have like a

114
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:56,139
third-party device that somebody's
giving you a cloud service for that

115
00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:00,730
cloud interface could also leaked data
from other people and so on mobile

116
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,559
interface we all have mobile phones
there aren't their applications aren't

117
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:10,149
well-built so instead of having like a
small attack surface you have a big

118
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:15,490
attack surface which covers network
protocols small biol web embedded

119
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,800
security everything and pretty much you
have everything that you can imagine

120
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,849
from the IT side of the center of this
world you have in IOT which means there

121
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,829
is a really hard

122
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:34,870
the difficulty of trying to set where is
the line in the attack surface and

123
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,459
what's the line of my system does 10 by
the cloud provider does 10 in my network

124
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:45,099
what can happen right by the way if you
want to ask a question anytime we can

125
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,260
just visit this link and

126
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:54,310
ask one in this talk i will just
concentrate on the IOT things so the

127
00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:00,219
gadgets you know the ones that we all
love so what's the attack surface pretty

128
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,870
much you can either attack the thing
physically not by using an axe or a

129
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,460
sledgehammer but you can attack it by
trying to get physical access to it and

130
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:15,070
then trying to do something with
physical access you can like try to use

131
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:20,530
physical access to obtain firmware file
systems images and you can use that to

132
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:25,810
get to the software informer abilities
if we go from the communication

133
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:31,209
standpoint the protocols are mostly
known mostly there is no need for for

134
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:36,970
reversing but you have a lot of free
your stuff like if you have a hacker f a

135
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:42,340
blader RF yardstick one anything you can
pretty much have fun with RF analysis

136
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,720
there is a lot of funnels other stuff
that we want to cover which is

137
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,970
side-channel attacks pretty much every
device uses some amount of power gives

138
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:59,170
up some other omission in that isn't its
primary like core functionality which

139
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:04,839
can be used to see or like leaked data
like he's or see what the machine is

140
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,740
really doing

141
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,070
that's some really interesting stuff and
that's a whole nother level of

142
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,240
vulnerabilities

143
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,310
the first one is something with which
covers pretty much software analysis

144
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:20,829
which we will cover a little bit on the
end but let's see for easy big threes

145
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,230
like you have a device you bought device

146
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,530
how can you hack it how can you do cool
stuff with it right

147
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:31,569
so the first question is why the why do
I want to do this the correct answer is

148
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,640
because you can if you don't have roots
and your machine is it really your

149
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,840
machine or is it somebody who's landing
in the machine as my friend of it said

150
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,250
once how can you measure the thing is
secure

151
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,910
how do you know if there are any
possible vulnerabilities are problems in

152
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:54,850
this so if you don't take it apart how
we know and do we have like a testing

153
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,510
methodology for I embedded IOT like a
penetration testing standard variety

154
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,790
gadgets

155
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:05,010
we don't so one part of my research is
actually trying to create a standard how

156
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:10,560
to break IOT things apart and the third
thing I want to answer is is the IOT top

157
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,420
10 relevant

158
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:18,270
yeah sure but their current status was I
think 12-16 devices and I need I think

159
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:25,319
it's helping right first always if it's
a harder talking with some tools people

160
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,130
think you need really expensive stuff
like this trying down thousands and

161
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,860
thousands of your hours that's not true

162
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,390
yeah 99% of the things you need is a
like a multi-tool screwdriver or

163
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,920
something and you need a thing called
the bus pirate or if you're feeling

164
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,829
really cool you can get something called
chica from Jupiter they're both go for

165
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:51,510
thirty dollars there are universal like
imagine it

166
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,310
what is the best part about priorities
and universal communications device

167
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,660
let's call it like that right so you can
connect it to a device and say hey I

168
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:06,030
want you to speak this protocol like I
square CSPI whatever and when you

169
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,290
connect your device you can pretty much
try and do something on over that

170
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,390
protocol so it will help you to use on
one end you have a USB and a serial

171
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:22,170
console and the second one you have your
device if you're you can use the best

172
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:28,740
part as an FDA cable that's like lefta
adapter it's usually cost $15 and i'm

173
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,660
too lazy to reprogram it every time like
a console so I just buy one fta adapter

174
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,490
and if you need probes to just connect
to something you need something called

175
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:43,350
easy hooks which i highly recommend
because if you look at the cheap probes

176
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,580
you can buy on aliexpress they're not as
good as easy hooks which you can also

177
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,640
buy on clones on aliexpress which are
pretty good

178
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,080
there's a lot of our stuff like JT
regulators hacker f's software-defined

179
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,090
radios all kinds of stuff logic
analyzers you don't need that for most

180
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:04,260
of the things the point is when for
instance constant arguments were talking

181
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,550
about one part of reverse engineering
and hacking i'm talking about the second

182
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,599
part i'm not really interested to build
something like internal purple

183
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,800
I'm interesting in getting a shower and
getting access to the device and then do

184
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:26,099
something all right so it's not really
distinct but it has some overlap so what

185
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,699
can you do if you have to do is first
you can jailbreak it for instance i have

186
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:34,380
one spool story later which pretty much
concern is jailbreaking one device or

187
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,519
you can see what's happening on there
what you're searching for

188
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,329
first off you're searching for either
factory set credentials like passwords

189
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:47,880
you would be amazed what kind of stuff
can you find those embedded devices like

190
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,740
you can find you can find like default
password that you didn't know we're

191
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,149
there you can just download or ssh into
the device and you're in you have root

192
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:01,860
but through the counties and fruit but
it's usually something like I know the

193
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:07,170
vendor name plus a prefix password
second thing is signing keys and

194
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,040
passwords in the firmware updates you
can usually find private piece which

195
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,019
enable you to login on different
machines or you can try and mend the

196
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:19,829
middle those devices without any
impunity because you have the private

197
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:24,689
key because the private key is
distributed to the same in the same

198
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:30,089
firmware image and it isn't recreated
per device right you can have like full

199
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:35,040
access to binary source code for web
applications which is great you have

200
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,130
source code for the software that runs
on that stuff

201
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:44,579
it's usually some version of PHP cgi
like stuff or something that's calling

202
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:48,089
pretty much something better on this
device which is usually written by

203
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:52,829
electrical engineering developers not
hating on anybody but the point is

204
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:58,349
usually the all the tech stuff like
buffer or forces area other old-school

205
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:05,730
trick you know we'll work on it so it is
so i have a cunning plan variant for

206
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,949
noobs first thing you want to find is
something called uart pretty much a

207
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:16,260
serial console on device I can guarantee
you that most of the devices have a

208
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:22,379
serial console somewhere you just need
to find it connect to it you'll probably

209
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,870
just reset the device you'll get a root
shell or a shell of some

210
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:30,040
and all you see are both process what
the serial console does is you don't

211
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,149
have vga and you don't have USB so you
can see what's happening on the device

212
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,910
but the serial console is the same thing

213
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:41,050
imagine guys that work with routers like
with cisco routers junipers when you

214
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,830
connect the serial console you can see
the boot process never think same with

215
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:50,350
embedded stuff right so how do you find
your ports airports there are a couple

216
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:56,199
of methods first one is looking because
they usually come marked the second one

217
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,150
is you can use a multimeter you can find
out which one is the ground which one is

218
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:06,160
plus three point three worlds or plus 5
volts you can see the one that's like

219
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,720
has some signal that's usually the
transmitter 1 and 3 c1 usually doesn't

220
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,570
have any it's really cool if you have a
logic analyzer like the seller somebody

221
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:21,040
like I don't know cause the doctor said
something about single cock if you buy a

222
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,960
cheap Chinese clone it works perfectly
with cigarette if you spend the heap of

223
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,270
money on a genuine pro version with 16
channels it does the work on seat rock

224
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:38,080
so if you don't need high-resolution
sewer scope / logic analysis stop just

225
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,990
get chinese conversion it's more than
enough there are specialized devices

226
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,940
that can find your reports that will get
bank all the possible combinations and

227
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,440
try to see if something is in New York
Port like the jtag you later and I like

228
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,820
the audio buzzer method which means if
you find the ground and you find the +

229
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:06,970
like the VC you just add one part of the
buzzer the ground onto the ground and

230
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,650
you try picking some pins that might
have that might be transmitting data to

231
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,510
you so if they transmitted you when you
put the butter on them you'll hear noise

232
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:22,990
right because it will change downs so if
you take a look you can see here

233
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:31,420
upstairs that in the upper part there's
like rxtx 3 volts and ground that's your

234
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,480
serial console just sold it on and off
you go

235
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,140
the this year lower part can be
something called the jtag

236
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:43,360
but you can check it out you can see
depends on all of the devices

237
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,440
sometimes they'll come with even
pre-salt the tethers if you see for

238
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,720
header pins on the board you can pretty
much bet it might be a serial port so

239
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,960
you don't have to like think too hard to
see if it isn't is or isn't this one is

240
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,730
on the ubiquity unify access point like
the ones that you see on the floor

241
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,510
that's their serial console so you can
connect it you can pretty much get a

242
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:12,520
shell on it and I'll do anything you
want to know linux terminal your

243
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:18,550
Raspberry Pi if you have one has a
serial console on the GPR I opens so you

244
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:24,430
don't have to connect it via HDMI you
can just simply connect the serial

245
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:29,590
console to its power it on and do your
conflict over serial console it takes

246
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,790
some work on raspberry pi 3 because it
shares the serial console with the

247
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:38,710
Bluetooth typing something like that but
you can pretty much match any Raspberry

248
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,700
Pi be a serial console so that's my
preferred way of doing it because you

249
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:50,350
don't have to lug around the monitor
which has hdmi on it sometimes you don't

250
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:55,840
have the revolt connection you have only
the ground transmit and receive that's

251
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,520
it that's enough

252
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,120
those three are minimum if you see noise
and you cannot if you just connect

253
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,169
transmit and receive and you have to
connect them cross over though and if

254
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,130
you see noise and you can have anything
any good date out of it

255
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,270
check your ground stable if you have a
good ground connection because if you

256
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:17,950
don't well everything's going to be
garbled sometimes you can find them like

257
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:24,730
labeled as VP in and DP out and the
ground somewhere else like on the

258
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:31,000
internet connectors shield you can grab
ground there tntp out our transmitter

259
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,370
receive right so there are serial
consoles available anywhere

260
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,459
you just need to look really hard or try
them

261
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:45,130
usually when you see all those fun
little pads you just try a buzzer on

262
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,270
them when you're pretty much see if
something is buzzing and has noise it

263
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,470
has some data coming out

264
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,220
with even better if you don't have a
buzzer using logic analyzer on the

265
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,620
silver scope they both were great see
here I didn't have a ground but they

266
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:05,709
grounded it on a USB connector which is
also ground it works it's a that one is

267
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:16,059
actually a tp-link mine miniature you
know that's the same thing that I set

268
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:20,530
all the earlier most routers have serial
console you can just connect them and

269
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:25,480
background and reconnect you can find
all kinds of interesting stuff for

270
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:31,570
instance you might have to configure
those / r / r central management system

271
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:36,100
like a central piece of software that
helps you manage all of those excess

272
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,510
points in the network

273
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,799
well if you connect via our serial
terminal to them you'll see that they

274
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:46,929
support something called u-boot a new
book if you know grab from linux boot is

275
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:48,549
the same thing right

276
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:53,408
so if you just check out what you go to
read a little bit of documentation

277
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:58,840
you'll find out that it's a simple
bootloader right so what can you do you

278
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:05,260
can't break it you cannot end it you you
don't have any other like you don't have

279
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:11,169
a shell on this machine so how do you
obtain the show does it do you remember

280
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:16,299
the old trick from lenox when you just
say that you're in it shouldn't be the

281
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:22,600
colonel but Ben sh so-- but--my the
business age same here is the same thing

282
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:29,559
here when you see the boot arguments are
causal TTYL 0 you can just simply say OK

283
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:36,399
in it Ben sh save environment boot what
will happen then I have an idea

284
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:43,659
pretty much that machine will boot into
our like a functioning root shell which

285
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:49,150
then you can see like cat atc past city
see what are the possible users on the

286
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,460
system and you can do anything else you
want

287
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,289
there is also a cool thing called non
glitching which I can explain how it

288
00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:00,399
works if we have time on the end so if
you're interested in on greeting card

289
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:04,959
works it's not voodoo it's not rocket
surgery it's pretty simple if you don't

290
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,370
wanna know about me

291
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:12,729
so what if you cannot have if you don't
have a serial console on the device

292
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:18,100
what else can you do well vendors
usually post the firmer updates are

293
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,559
firmer images on their pages if you
download the firmware image you can

294
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:26,799
pretty much disassembler to see what
happened what's inside

295
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,460
by the way when I say disassembled I
don't been using either or die or

296
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,179
something like that it's way more
simpler give me a minute

297
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:40,000
plan B is trying to intercept an OTA
update over-the-air update so its base

298
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,320
to have like packet captures of your
test network when somebody is trying to

299
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:51,520
push you on over there update you just
have the content there the plan c is you

300
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,350
can try to dump the known non-volatile
ram in situ that means from the board

301
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:00,610
you can directly connect to the chip and
try to extract all the data out of it

302
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:05,139
it's still all the thing is the only
thing you need for this is your bus

303
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:11,230
pirate so it's still under very .
dollars plan see you can answer the chip

304
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:16,750
Reid in an adapter will talk about it
later or you can use something like a

305
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:24,100
jtag to just dump the whole nvram
content or if you have or if it's an AVR

306
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,178
like are doing up there is a command
that pretty much does this one connected

307
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:32,260
to the are doing them so how does it
look

308
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:40,059
people say yeah if you want to dump if
you want to dump data from chips you

309
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:43,840
need something like a psychic clip
that's a genuine

310
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:50,560
clip and you connected to a chip it will
like by the chip and you can then have a

311
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,440
little pins on it and you can connect
any device you want like a logic

312
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,380
analyzer bus pirates whatever those
costs like thirty forty fifty dollars

313
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:04,060
depending on the quality or low-quality
Chinese ones for ten bucks which are by

314
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:09,790
the way same thing but i would suggest
you don't bother with them just by a set

315
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:14,800
of nice easy probes those are easy hooks
they are tightening up so you can pretty

316
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,000
much take them on any soy chip and you
will dump date the other words with no

317
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,380
problem so instead of spending money on
the clip just buy some nice probes you

318
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,210
can reuse for everything else

319
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:31,360
you don't have to spend a lot of money
that's the the thing down is a bus

320
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,949
pirate it's another clone i have a
genuine i have a clone same thing pretty

321
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:44,590
much how will you find which chip is the
like the nvram the flash chip how to

322
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,379
find which one has all the interesting
stuff

323
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:57,250
well if you just put 25 q12 1128 at efg
into google guess what you'll find I

324
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:03,310
don't know it's how how big far flash
chip so pretty much using google on the

325
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,669
chips will tell you which one is the
first ship so which one you can dump and

326
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,870
the interesting part this if you check
out software for firmware that we'll

327
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:17,050
talk about later it has the chip numbers
in them so if you just do find on the

328
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,030
page you can pretty much find it

329
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:25,120
the my elite shouldering skills can be
seen dance the in the lower part of the

330
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,790
image where I try to solder are jtag
connector to aboard with which has no

331
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:39,250
true holds but it says only pogo pins so
i just sold it pretty badly you can

332
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,290
pretty much do any of this

333
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:45,460
not by connecting any headers but
directly interfacing with the polar with

334
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:50,920
the pins on the board using something
called photo pins if you ask me I

335
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,970
wouldn't recommend it because you have
the soldier and adapter for the program

336
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,220
means you have to pretty much

337
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,780
make a consistent connection all the
time which if get somebody else to hold

338
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:07,510
it because you need that's a two-person
job and if you think about it from more

339
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:12,640
example take somewhere between one to
four hours so if you don't create the

340
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,690
jig that will hold everything in place
will pretty much fail on that so it's

341
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:23,320
pretty much better to folder ahead on it
for jtag there are various devices like

342
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,760
the jtag writer which enable you to find
the correct jtech been out with relative

343
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,419
ease

344
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:34,870
so if your instant that you can go that
route but I I don't like this like this

345
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:39,789
route why because first I think open or
city is too much of a hassle second will

346
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:42,850
try searching for easy victories so what
can you do

347
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:48,789
first one is a dump like a show
dinnerware picture you can pretty much

348
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:53,890
dump the firmware out of the chip or the
second fingers you can try to run it in

349
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:59,049
a virtual machine so when you connect
all of your products to a flash chip and

350
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:02,230
you connect them to a bus priority there
is actually a schematic on the platform

351
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,760
site how do you need to connect each pin
with one command you can pretty much

352
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:13,299
dump the whole flagship into a file so
its way to our single get all the

353
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:19,480
content so you ever had have the dumped
firmware or you download it from the

354
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,919
vendor's page what can you do now there
are a couple of tools that can help you

355
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:33,039
first off some of those images are
compressed with either gzip or lzma you

356
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:38,200
can use something like Ben walk which
will tell you if the image is compressed

357
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,179
and we'll try to decompress it also use
something like Sasquatch which supports

358
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:46,720
even more compression algorithm so if
you've got something really as at Eric

359
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,100
Sasquatch you can pretty much handle it
which will happen when you just type in

360
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:56,230
waukon sasquatch and the name of a
firmer dump it will give you the offsets

361
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,690
where each part starts and the
description

362
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:04,630
what did Sasquatch or a min walk find
that offset you can see squash FS

363
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:10,400
filesystem executable script executable
script elf binary unix path

364
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:17,240
something of binary 3xz like that LCM a
compress the data files and a little

365
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,610
package with Ben walk when you can
pretty much easily extract each of those

366
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:27,199
parts into a file so with squash effects
you can do something called unsporting

367
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:33,440
effects and unimpressive with XZ you can
decompress eggs into another folder you

368
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,340
can simply check out the file system
like you had shell access on that

369
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,629
machine on your box right so what you're
looking for you're looking for software

370
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:47,630
and abilities config files start with
the start with the easy stuff like HTC

371
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:52,430
passivity which will have all the
password for the system try cron jobs

372
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:57,380
try web applications there's all kinds
of stuff you can find ssh-keys most of

373
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,640
the time you can find the ssh keys on
the machine so you don't have to butter

374
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:08,210
there's also all kinds of cool stuff you
can find like private certificates and

375
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:16,520
all other type of stuff and usually all
the partitions each partition you can

376
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,330
mount them you can extract them as
immature as part of an image you can

377
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,740
mount them to are normally like you'd do
with an iso image on your machine and

378
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,290
analyze it

379
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:33,020
one popular part you want to see
Annalise is the init system

380
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:38,930
thank God that for instance iety hasn't
switched the systemd but we have the old

381
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:45,230
school system five right so one thing
you want to see is there's anybody see a

382
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,640
problem with this picture

383
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,650
what yeah I created that one but what's
the point

384
00:31:54,150 --> 00:32:00,690
all of them are worried about a readable
and writable and they all get executed

385
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:07,230
by root so just read edit a file reboot
the machine and your code which whatever

386
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:12,090
you put in any of those files will get
executed so it's simple to add a new

387
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:18,090
user to the system or whatever else you
want to do you can even if you have

388
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:23,939
firmware files you can modify them and
use something like frame walker or from

389
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,890
a compilation toolkit that will enable
you to create a custom firmware file and

390
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,790
then burn it to a device which will have
you're already you're pretty rude

391
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:40,530
version see a firm worker will also
search for various other things like

392
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:45,570
default password file set of files
configurations it's a nice thing to use

393
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,929
because it will save you a lot of time

394
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:52,530
another possible attack vector is what
happens when you don't have a flash chip

395
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,330
on the device

396
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,810
another cool thing that's replacing five
ships for instance in things like

397
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:06,270
fridges which this is a fridge that the
runs android on it so god help us all if

398
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:11,010
you have if you open it up you'll have
and you are shell which you can connect

399
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:17,580
and then you have an android root shell
or if you can't find any flash files try

400
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,600
searching for ma emmc files water emmc
files

401
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,969
everybody knows like SD cards right we
have each one of us has at least some SD

402
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:34,710
cards DMC is pretty much the same thing
but it's not in SD card format but it's

403
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:42,780
a BGA chip on a on the board so those
are really popular because you can get

404
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:47,700
them in four eight sixteen 64 gig
variety and they can hold the whole

405
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:54,630
android system if if it runs Android it
probably has emmc so what you can do is

406
00:33:54,630 --> 00:34:01,530
tap onto the emmc and emc tap is pretty
much simply need something called an EMC

407
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:06,360
adapter it has a couple of lines you
have to identify the correct clients on

408
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,219
the chip with

409
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:13,280
just the hard part why because it's a
BGA chip sometimes you have enough help

410
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,490
so they will come the top lines will
come

411
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:22,310
mark so see which one is the data line
command line voltage line clock line and

412
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,690
sometimes they want to get park so what
you can do is if you have a good

413
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,280
veterinarian which has like a digital
x-ray machine you can probably x-ray

414
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:38,179
this this stuff and then see on the
x-ray or Plan B is pretty much how they

415
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:44,149
call it hit and miss but you can pretty
much see which one is the voltage which

416
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:49,520
one is the clock which one is the data
line command line by simply using a

417
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,300
logic analyzer the voltage line will
pretty much stay stable the ground line

418
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:58,880
will be low the clock line will have a
repeating pattern and then you have

419
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,550
simply data and command line but you'll
see the data line by booting has a lot

420
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,550
more output to then the command line and
so on

421
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:14,119
the other possibility is if you have a
like a good sponsor that's willing to

422
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:20,690
give you three or four types of the same
hardware device what you can do is

423
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:26,750
pretty much take one take it apart on
soldier it installed the BGA chip the

424
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:31,820
MMC chip out of it by a reader of
aliexpress by the way did I tell you the

425
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,349
Chinese are awesome people always
usually hate on them because they break

426
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:40,790
stuff but you can buy all kinds of cool
gets from them that really helped in

427
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:46,009
reverse engineering and breaking stuff
like EMC adapters your solder the chip

428
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:52,130
poppet in powered on and you have a mass
storage device so you have for full mass

429
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:58,040
storage axis you can pretty much you can
pretty much read the whole thing as you

430
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:04,520
would a memory stick right for instance
there are a lot of other vectors you can

431
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:09,410
use and all that mess to see all of them
are pretty simple it's usually just that

432
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:12,410
it's not really rocket surgery

433
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:19,700
another possibility you have is like the
ubiquity routers like the top edge

434
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,509
routers

435
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:24,860
they have a USB stick condom so if you
take the most part you'll see an USB

436
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:30,380
stick on them and if you try to look it
up on your system you'll see there it's

437
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,670
actually linux and it's actually my app
and guess what

438
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,720
there are good people from freebsd that
created the image which you can boot off

439
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,140
a proton have previously on it

440
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:47,210
there's also all kinds of interesting
stuff if you have like a USB stick you

441
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,500
can edit that file system and you can
add anything you want into the basis of

442
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:57,020
BD file you can reverse it you can have
fun with it like the same thing with the

443
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:03,980
chromecast right they have AMC and they
have a lot of a lot of other pads that

444
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:10,580
you can pretty much see if it's a serial
thermal go up there are not one other

445
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:16,910
cool fingers for instance that when
we're talking about chromecast its micro

446
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:24,740
USB port which is for power isn't only
power it's an micro USB on-the-go so

447
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:29,149
it's you can boot out of it so you can
pretty much if you have a chromecast you

448
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:35,630
can put out of it there is a lot of
stuff about it like checkout exploiters

449
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:41,690
that RS there are exploiters that RS
they have all that stuff document pretty

450
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:46,880
much there's a lot of cool attacks you
can do if you just try to think what did

451
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,310
the developers think and how to
developers bootstrap those devices

452
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:59,690
called they get code onto them in
production right and now people say Mac

453
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,290
hardware hacking like software is there
something I can do from the really

454
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,670
script to decide

455
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:10,490
remember the over stop then RT top 10
which is the most common vulnerability

456
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:16,189
it was insecure web interface and what
do you think what's the most common

457
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:22,130
vulnerability in IOT for you check the
web interface its command injection why

458
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:26,990
because usually want to have a web
interface that's lean and you want to

459
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:32,450
execute small binaries on the system
right so what every developer does is

460
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,819
they create like a binding

461
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:38,949
that will execute the system binary with
some arguments which any developer nose

462
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:44,410
will lead to command injection the idea
is simple one finger like to do is when

463
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:49,359
I have gadgets flying around as connect
them to are intercepting proxy and

464
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,130
connect them to an access point that I
control and first call the web interface

465
00:38:54,130 --> 00:39:00,009
second user permeability scare with a
really slow rate and leave it overnight

466
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:05,769
in the morning what you'll find this all
kinds of interesting stuff one of those

467
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:11,649
one of that interesting stuff is a
pretty much you can find always at least

468
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,619
one or two remote code execution
abilities command injection

469
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:17,499
vulnerabilities all kinds of interesting
stuff

470
00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:22,390
let's not talk about excess that stuff
comes in heaps but here's like one

471
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,140
interesting thing I found for this
little device which is an IP connected

472
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:31,058
power socket you have command injection
on it so why is this useful

473
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:35,589
well this reliability pretty much helps
me to create the curl command of my

474
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:40,989
terminal so when I say like living room
light off very much exploit or inability

475
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:46,900
to turn off a small lamp in in my room
which i think is cool but it can be

476
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:51,819
practical but it can be also very
interesting to see that developers

477
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:57,400
didn't run a simple vulnerability scan
against their devices because if any of

478
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,150
you is a web developer you know that
vulnerability scanning is something like

479
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:06,009
totally basic we're not talking about
penetration testing or any other is a

480
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:10,569
complex methodology were saying about
trying the lowest-hanging fruit that

481
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:15,160
doesn't require any intelligence to do
and you can still find a lot of

482
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,660
vulnerabilities with that

483
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,078
so should you really care about it

484
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,359
okay it might be cool to each time you
want to turn on and turn off the lamp in

485
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:29,619
your living room to exploit a
vulnerability that might be called for

486
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:35,109
you but should you care well remember
the smart fridge remember the smart

487
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:40,150
connected light blob blob remember the
IP connected toilet seat are things

488
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:46,530
going on IP right so we pretty much are
putting devices into our networks

489
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:51,810
which are built by let's say the lowest
bidder and God knows whether they send

490
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:56,580
out the internet usually all kinds of
stuff there was the iir connected the

491
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:04,529
USB to ir thingy it sends data to China
god knows what but if you think about it

492
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:09,150
from an attackers perspective charity
devices are the perfect implants you

493
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,530
need in the network

494
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:15,990
why first there are the ideal pivot
point how many times do you think and

495
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:24,509
smart blood gets rebooted zero until you
scream it out how many times does this

496
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:30,840
smartblood get rebooted or normally pull
it out of the wall right so all these

497
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:36,840
devices are permanently connected and
the worst thing is during our network

498
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:42,990
there on linux and SE and the kids can
exploit them and the first thing is you

499
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:47,250
hack one of them and now i have for
instance dishes and exploit that work

500
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:53,910
against any of them even the data center
connected IP videos like Power

501
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:58,020
Distribution unit where you connect
servers the same export works on the

502
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:03,000
single one that costs like 60 bucks and
the same one works on direct mounted

503
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:10,890
ones so pretty much that's a small
problem and remember how hacking team

504
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:15,600
got hacked one thing that was
interesting to me I like like the most

505
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,440
favorite think they liked reading this
forensics reports either the hackers

506
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,700
breaking how they had something because
you know you can learn a lot out of

507
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:31,290
those reports so there was one guy who
hacked hacking team is soon ms Phineas

508
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:36,210
Fisher unknowable is but you have him on
twitter you can follow him one thing he

509
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:41,940
wrote in his in his post for something
like 10 day in an embedded device seemed

510
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:46,200
like the easiest option and after two
weeks of work reverse-engineering I got

511
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,890
a remote the root X . since the
vulnerability still haven't been patched

512
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,390
i won't give the details

513
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:55,509
what happened was he did his recon he
founded in there

514
00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:00,070
are publicly facing part of the network
they have an embedded device it was not

515
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:05,710
know what it was it was never given in
the clear but he could identify what

516
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:10,390
kind of device it was he bought a couple
of them on ebay start reversing them and

517
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:13,660
he found the vulnerability that he used
to put into their network

518
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:20,020
how many times does embedded device get
rebooted very rare and they're sec even

519
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:25,120
the big ones get hacked with embedded
hardware when you start some lateral

520
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,290
thinking pretty much when you have land
access you get owned

521
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:35,470
even if it even worse if it's a Windows
domain and know how many if you played

522
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:39,490
around with hacking the windows domains
but there are also all kinds of

523
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:44,709
interesting things you can do you can
poison a request with responder pretty

524
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:50,080
much get credentials credentials are the
boxes you can mend the middle like our

525
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:55,870
poison the whole network you can try to
poison updates with back their factory

526
00:43:55,870 --> 00:44:01,569
you can inject stuff into unencrypted
web pages and pretty much get to take

527
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:07,540
over control of a certain top on the net
or offer guided served page unencrypted

528
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:12,460
so it's pretty scary to think what can
happen when your attacker has line axis

529
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:18,520
when something has landed axis you're
done your own pretty much because it's

530
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:23,710
not hard to escalate unless you really
hard and your network so it's pretty

531
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:29,530
much right once you pull your mom away
malware everywhere because all of those

532
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:33,910
run abilities are pretty much reusable
you get one of those devices this cheap

533
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:39,310
and you can pretty much on all of them
when you find one vulnerability so

534
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:44,560
otherwise say the Internet of Things is
coming from a security perspective we're

535
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,090
naturally and everybody loves their IP
connected fridges everybody loves all

536
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:52,480
kinds of IP connected stuff and i'm
pretty much scared of it

537
00:44:53,830 --> 00:45:00,009
well the second call fingers own some of
the stuff you own like you'll be really

538
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:05,290
happy to see what happens in your
network and before buying in

539
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:10,930
former self if the vendor did some of
the mortal security sense just just

540
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:15,430
google for instance if you want to buy
let's say are connected

541
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:21,700
Bob for light google like security
vulnerability hack route something and

542
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,810
you'll find all kinds of interesting
stuff you'll see that the people do data

543
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:30,580
exfiltration out of smart lightbulbs
wouldn't have known

544
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,780
so what's the moral of this noble source

545
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:39,880
well if you take if you develop free
open-source software take note because

546
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,590
if any vendor decides to lockout device
like locket so you cannot root it

547
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:51,040
jailbreak something if you have physical
access it is way more easier to get that

548
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:57,670
data open by default is broken we should
build security into the stuff we develop

549
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:02,110
each one of you work somewhere most of
you because you're interested in this

550
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:07,540
you work mostly 90 or in connected areas
people should get more knowledge it's

551
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,050
not really knowledge and not everybody
know how to hack stuff and get through

552
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:15,580
the boxes but they should be aware of
the risks if you're aware of those risks

553
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:25,060
you can make more same decisions so use
your brain think and stay safe right so

554
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,060
up I'll take questions if you have them

555
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:38,570
you can use the URL or you can just
simply use the live one

556
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:48,050
I'm fine with the live stuff anymore
questions don't be shy

557
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:02,460
so if there are no questions you can
pick me yelling told me that I should

558
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:07,080
tell you that now is the official
workshop in the rocky workshop it's in

559
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:15,210
the lounge area so by the invite of the
Vulcan organizing theme cm and thank you
