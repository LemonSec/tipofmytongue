1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:21,620
yeah

2
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:30,620
hi everyone so as they announced me my
name is Monica ski and I'm a hawker are

3
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,640
you a hacker's yeah yeah great

4
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:42,200
how many of you are a black hat hackers
ok there's a police guy out there so

5
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,239
check in there okay just kidding just
kidding you're safe here

6
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,879
no problems so i work as a hacker but an
ethical hacker so I don't do anything

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,080
bad

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:02,599
so far I never knows my work as a
penetration tester goes under my company

9
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:09,530
name perhaps can dissociate we are a
little team from Macedonia country where

10
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:15,650
live and work but we don't focus only on
projects in my country work abroad of

11
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:22,370
course this presentation will be
focusing on hacking attacks power 5

12
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,980
version 6 truck driven malware in my
spare time I like to do some research

13
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,270
and to develop a new malware so in 2010

14
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:41,120
I first created my undetectable children
undetectable malware which was very good

15
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:48,680
because no system was able to detect it
and I started to upload our samples of

16
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,890
my mouth where to

17
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:58,730
virustotal and still my mom were remain
undetectable even the sample is at the

18
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:07,640
analyst pc course and after a couple of
years a couple of years I mean in 2014

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:16,010
so about four years later we come to a
point to that mark my model where is

20
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:22,010
detectable so it took four years for the
mall where researchers for the analysts

21
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:29,060
to discover that the file that was
uploaded is malware and to create that

22
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,790
signature for detection

23
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:41,810
but of course we evolved so I created a
new way of function for my where and

24
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:50,810
that is the use of IP version 6 and the
way of dividing the dropper in the pay

25
00:02:50,810 --> 00:03:01,159
lot so a little question what's your
favorite malware how many of you want

26
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:07,069
stealth malware or have a poverty in
stealth mode over

27
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:17,000
nope ok they have your own malware
developed yeah one just one

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,180
okay great so you're in favorite of your
malware yeah great so i have here

29
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,560
a little present for you you can pick it
up later

30
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,620
this is quite interesting logic cube to
develop your skills more and more to

31
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:47,280
think of new ways that malware could
function is great it and I have one more

32
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,810
question which statement is false i will
give you about three seconds to read all

33
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,200
of these statements and say which one is
false

34
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:08,010
ok which one is false eee

35
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,760
each yeah great so it is false
definitely

36
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:20,620
which means that this is a community and
we're not attacking ourselves we are not

37
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:27,070
spreading malware unlike the commercial
the commercial conferences are quite

38
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,990
interesting a lot of guys wants to
attack other guys vendors are fighting

39
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,010
between themselves but here in community
there is no spread of malware was

40
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:43,690
because we are the good guys here let's
talk about malware news so we all know

41
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:49,030
that advanced detection by the antivirus
vendors is happening

42
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:57,940
yeah and the smaller developers are
fighting against it with developing that

43
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,200
artificial intelligence that traps
inside the malware which automatically

44
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:08,919
discovered the ways that the advanced
protection work at the vendor software

45
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:15,820
and when they discovered their
immediately shut down the malware so the

46
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:24,310
malware detection will not be able to
identify tend to create a signature for

47
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,539
that malware today by how that malware
is functioning the other thing is that

48
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:36,760
the news nowadays has this one time
malware which means that we have this

49
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,669
cyber weapons developed only for one
time use so a lot of government agencies

50
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:51,880
are using it is not double about it
happens it happens then we have this

51
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,150
malware service which we have this
commercial malware like around somewhere

52
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,770
for example you can generate your own
ransomware malware and then get the

53
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,599
subscription online via darknet and then
propagate that malware and then just

54
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:11,530
collect your bitcoins of course you will
live a little bit coins for the

55
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:16,989
developers in the dark net but it's also
something you in malware world nowadays

56
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:21,289
so my malware before in 2010

57
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:29,628
and was developed mainly around this
sore algorithm which was trying to make

58
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:34,939
the cold little scrambled so no
detection will be possible for the

59
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:39,860
signature of my calls so each time i
generate a new malware with you with

60
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,729
that procedure with external rhythm the
malware was completely undetectable

61
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:52,308
until it was analyzed by the malware
final analyzers from the security vendor

62
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:58,969
companies but next time I developed a
new and used the same procedure and

63
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:05,869
again that it was completely
undetectable the powerful format for

64
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:11,180
spreading malware windows operating
systems is the msi format of that

65
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,629
executable why why msi is powerful

66
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:19,189
ok how many of you know that

67
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,189
YMS eyes powerful for spreading malware

68
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,229
mm maybe but that's not the correct
answer

69
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:38,610
ok the others well there is a user
access control in Microsoft operating

70
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:46,169
systems and when you trigger execution
of msi the execution automatically pops

71
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:47,849
up the window

72
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:53,159
do you allow user access control i ask
you to allow execution of these are

73
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,650
automatically that user access control
if the user says yes is bypassed by the

74
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:07,080
malware so then we don't have to
escalate privileges in a way that to

75
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,729
exploit the vulnerability in microsoft
operating system is very easy without

76
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:18,330
user access control you can easily get
into the kernel and so that's the msi so

77
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,729
that's why i'ma sighs so powerful and
msi malware on Windows operating system

78
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:31,139
has that capability of getting one step
beyond and not enlarge the cold with the

79
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:35,190
specific sheltered for escalation of
privileges or bypassing the user access

80
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:42,779
control so since 2010 i send that
malware to virustotal all the time i

81
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:47,579
generate new new version of my mall
we're using the store and send it and

82
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:51,899
it's completely undetectable and then
again generate and send it is completely

83
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:57,300
undetectable and in couple of years they
they started to Detective but only the

84
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,439
samples that i have sent and when I
generate a new sample with axe or

85
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:09,209
algorithm completely undetectable again
since 2014 2014 advanced detection was

86
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:15,449
implemented in several antivirus engines
and from then they successfully detect

87
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:21,329
the several techniques that are inside
my mouth where we'll explore algorithm

88
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:24,329
so in 2015

89
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,470
it's detectable let me show you

90
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,170
yeah

91
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:50,440
so this is my malware uploaded my old
malware simple uploaded to virustotal

92
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:57,580
one year and three months ago so the
result is only 10 antiviruses out of 57

93
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:05,080
that are able to detect it and I will
scroll down just to point out you can

94
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:11,860
see which vendors detected it but let me
scroll down just to show you that one of

95
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:22,330
the interesting big vendors are on the
list that are not able to detect it

96
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:28,150
so this is kaspersky this is
malwarebytes i'm not saying that these

97
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:33,010
vendors are not good but i just
mentioned that they don't have this

98
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:37,360
detection advanced detection inside yet

99
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:56,969
so what's what what's new how my mother
works now

100
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,429
so last year I started the project to
develop a new malware that can function

101
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:09,238
completely undetectable and it can try
to exploit something that nobody else

102
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:10,319
has

103
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:17,309
so it's an IP version 6 so how many of
you use IP version 6 1 2 3 4 5

104
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,549
ok i use global IP version 6 yet

105
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:28,679
okay great so nice to hear that nice to
see that the use of fiber version sixes

106
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:36,779
and large because previous conferences
the IP version 6 usage people that get

107
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:42,809
their hands up was zero so hope that
next year it will be maybe all of you

108
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:48,660
that you will use IP version 6 but let's
get back to how my malware is using IP

109
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:58,079
version 6 so I analyzed that what is the
element that can be used by any IP

110
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:05,128
version 4 in IP version 6 and be
exploited by by the malware so it's an

111
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:13,559
dns dynamic neighbors are that the
protocol that resolute that results the

112
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:23,790
dns queries to an IP address has this
new resource records its AAA which is

113
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:32,189
getting the IP version 6 address to to
RPC and i have seen that the IP version

114
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:37,860
6 addresses quite beak so I have come to
me an idea to get inside the IP version

115
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:44,069
6 mypay lot so it means that the dropper
the dropper the part of the malware

116
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:50,069
that's executed on the local machine on
the machine that you in fact with

117
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:57,540
malware is let's say regular document
PDF xfr Maasai you name it

118
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,550
there are a lot of ways how to propagate
the dropper but the point is that that

119
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:06,949
one-strap detection by the antivirus
vendors are focusing on the pay lot and

120
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:12,170
what happens when the droppers there
there's no pay a lot inside and there is

121
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:19,399
a way for the dropper to get the pay lot
of course if the if we use https in

122
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:25,820
short time it's very easy to for
security vendor student by are malicious

123
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:32,089
service that propagates the bay lot and
of course in some situations we might be

124
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:37,040
limited in communication way so the
firewall blocks all the communication

125
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,819
except dns so that's quite interesting
except enso it means that d host that's

126
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,899
on the internal network that's
compromised with the malware dropper can

127
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:53,420
do resolution of the NS records and then
I get the IP version 6 addresses of

128
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,380
course it cannot communicate with them
but it will get the IP version 6 address

129
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,990
so I've content interesting concept of
getting that I provision six addresses

130
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:10,640
to be the pay lot so then I come to a
situation how that payload will be

131
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,260
executed and to stay undetectable of
course in Microsoft operating systems

132
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:23,990
are d run to fight against linux they
have developed the powershell so the

133
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,399
powerful is very powerful yeah
definitely i agree i use it and so on so

134
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,709
forth but the security around powershell
is very poor so it means that if you use

135
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:39,800
powershell for hacking you can easily
bypass a lot of security measures that

136
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:46,490
Microsoft has the hantavirus vendors
software has and then say undetectable

137
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:52,520
so I've come to an idea that the payload
that will come to an IP version 6

138
00:14:52,520 --> 00:15:00,319
address will be translated into the
powershell execution called so it might

139
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,820
the bypass that way all of the other
security measures that we have on the

140
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:12,290
system's so how this exploitation
happens on this slide here

141
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:23,540
you can see that the IP version 6
address is quite big so if we get the IP

142
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:33,050
version 6 address divided into our code
that looks like shellcode then that

143
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:38,780
shellcode could be executed but the
other way if we get the real shellcode

144
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,060
about this one this is just an example

145
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:46,520
well for the one direction but if we get
the real shellcode translated into IP

146
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,680
version 6 address and then we can get
that into a resource records on the dns

147
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:58,520
server which will be serving that IP
version 6 addresses on dns queries by

148
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,910
the power dropper

149
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:07,910
so this is a shell called the shellcode
is a simple shell called execution of

150
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:13,400
calculator and Microsoft operating
system and as you can see it's quite big

151
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:20,000
we have shellcodes of course that can be
smaller but this is just pure for the

152
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,920
example it's translated into m16 IP
version 6 addresses so you can see that

153
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:36,800
version 6 addresses on the right side
and in first look they are completely ok

154
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,170
so they don't cook some like something
suspicious or something that points out

155
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:48,229
the malware so there is no regular
expression by the network intrusion

156
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,690
detection systems that can detect this
IP version 6 addresses that present the

157
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,640
malware and so on so forth and of course
we can get additional step to scramble

158
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:06,050
them if the intrusion detection systems
developed that regular expression but

159
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:09,919
that's for the other conference next
year

160
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:16,339
cape so what happens the first part how
the malware is functioning is that of

161
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:21,619
course the dropper is executed on the
victim machine

162
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:29,169
and eat sense of dns queries for AAAA
records in order to retrieve the IP

163
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:36,249
version 6 address those queries are able
to be executed even on internal systems

164
00:17:36,249 --> 00:17:38,679
on which you don't have internet access

165
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,269
why is that possible because every
system has the dns server so internal

166
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:47,799
systems like military systems for
example have internal dns service so

167
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:53,590
they are able those internal dns service
are able to resolve to an IP address and

168
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,939
to give that information to the internal
costs which have no internet

169
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,850
connectivity and this is not something
you know there is a malware which

170
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:10,539
functions through dns it rude all the
traffic through the use of dns packets

171
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:16,119
but this is new in a way that the IP
version 6 address is used to deliver the

172
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:22,928
bay wat into the dropper so then after
receiving the IP version 6 addresses as

173
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:29,200
a reply to the dns queries the dropper
converts no size version 6 addresses

174
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,549
into and she'll call so this is the
shellcode so automatically we are able

175
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,690
then to execute the shellcode but now we
come to an situation that there are

176
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:46,869
security measures that Microsoft have
implemented Microsoft operating systems

177
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:51,668
have implemented inside so we need to
bypass them and here comes that

178
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:58,299
powershell that i was talking about we
convert that show called for powershell

179
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:04,749
injection so you can see the PowerShell
command and it's having this attribute

180
00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:10,779
hidden which means that there is no
option for the user to see that this is

181
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:18,009
executed on his post and then after
execution of that PowerShell command we

182
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:21,820
have this calculator pop up so it's
quite easy it's quite straightforward

183
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,690
anyway let's try to show this in action
how this look like

184
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,010
yeah

185
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,850
yeah finally

186
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,659
ok so

187
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:55,779
ok

188
00:19:55,779 --> 00:20:05,080
yeah we can hear great so what I have
here is great

189
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:11,168
yeah I have a zoom it . don't worry

190
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:18,219
what I have here is my executable so i
have created these are my mouth where

191
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:24,879
exif I'll it's available and get happen
in binary version hope that I will have

192
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:31,330
enough time to filter out and create
that might on code in good looking for

193
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:38,379
man publish it also in get app so my
malware has the same parameters it's as

194
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:45,879
a number of URLs number of frequently
qualified domain names to resolve its 16

195
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:53,859
so that's the number of IP addresses and
then we have this this number one which

196
00:20:53,859 --> 00:21:02,889
is 1 or 0 1 means that use an external
dns which follows the next parameter and

197
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:08,678
if we have 0 then it should not follow
this parameter anymore it will use the

198
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:14,649
internal dns server that is set up to
the network configuration be a dhcp or

199
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:23,349
manually and then we have all of this
frequently a frequently product domain

200
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:32,529
name you are else which will resolve to
an IP version 6 address their setup on

201
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:39,099
my dns server of course for educational
and testing purposes only so that's why

202
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:44,200
the shellcode behind those hyperion six
address is only the execution of

203
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,499
calculator so they could not be misused
for something else and you have a

204
00:21:50,499 --> 00:21:53,619
problem with your tortures you with the
authorities here

205
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:58,089
ok so let's execute and see what happens

206
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:09,959
ki think that we have a problem maybe
with the internet let me check

207
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,559
yeah

208
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,730
and

209
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,899
yeah now we have great so let's execute
again

210
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,570
ok so it should pop up

211
00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:04,860
yeah here is it it's the calculator yeah
great so I previously executed it and

212
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:13,409
capture the dns packets just to see how
they look like so i have here the for

213
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:19,740
example this one this is the dns query
here you can see that it goes to the

214
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:34,980
public dns of google v88 and the query
goes for AV to the press com type pee

215
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:41,430
and the response back has this but Sir

216
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,530
is it so the response back

217
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:57,910
here's the answer is this IP version 6
address and yet no antivirus or less a

218
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:02,680
network intrusion detection system is
able to detect with regular expression

219
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:08,380
is this IP version 6 address valid or
invalid in order to drop the packet but

220
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,180
i hope that they will create that
signature in time because this is quite

221
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:17,980
new technique no malware since i have
developed this technique is up in the

222
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:24,760
wild using it but of course we are here
so you all know now so maybe you will

223
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:31,480
use it and then the security guys at the
network intrusion detection system

224
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,120
vendor companies will have to develop
that regular expression so but just when

225
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,219
you use it don't use it in an ethical
form only ethical only attack yourselves

226
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,220
okay great

227
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:03,410
okay great so any questions so far yet
one question

228
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,970
sorry just a second for the might

229
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,960
wait for the mic please thank you

230
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,210
yeah

231
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,210
there

232
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:43,860
hi a question but what about using the n
is ems txt records instead of a records

233
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:51,060
yeah you can use that also but txt
records are into the network intrusion

234
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,950
detection systems analyzed in detail so
that they have that rule encrypt them

235
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,250
like also maybe yet but then it will be
suspicious

236
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:04,380
okay to be suspicious and when you
resolve for dns in IP version 6

237
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:10,020
addresses let's say that we have this
mobile devices in 2015 we have well i

238
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,970
don't know i think enlargement of two
hundred percent of usage in mobile

239
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:19,470
devices and they're all support IP
version States function IP version 6

240
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:24,750
what happens they all do the query
support the activation six addresses

241
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:32,880
yeah so we can to prevent that but we
can let's say we cannot prevent but but

242
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,380
we can use it in a way that our malware
can function on those devices because

243
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,980
the dropper does not have to be on
Microsoft operating system it can be a

244
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:50,970
APK file so it can be definitely also an
executable on linux so it's a

245
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,980
platform-independent it's a mechanism of
communication that this platform

246
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:03,570
independent and of course you can easily
exploit the IP version 6 into and shell

247
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:09,030
code and then get what what you want to
get with your malware of course if it is

248
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,770
to function because around somewhere
then you can get it to encrypt or in

249
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:18,120
some cases even need the fully qualified
domain name can be used to send a

250
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,310
message student attacker so the attacker
when he receives that on his dns server

251
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,300
you will be able to know what he is
dealing with is the on the other side

252
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:32,220
windows 7 windows 8 with eight 11 then
so on always some server or or some

253
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,110
linux that ok

254
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:39,040
maybe another another question maybe on
how would you spread out which is spread

255
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:44,860
out the domain names being queried
because here you had just one domain the

256
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:49,000
front of the main which is that so
suspiciously ya next year on the Falcon

257
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,850
2017 feel free to visit my lecture again
I will have malware as a service

258
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,799
yeah we're we're i will use the public
dns there it will be interesting for

259
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:03,790
demonstration of course i'm not selling
it will just need for educational

260
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,330
backgrounds

261
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:13,149
yeah okay thank you welcome to some
other questions yeah

262
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:25,220
some volunteer to spread the mic around
so yeah okay I wanted to ask where i

263
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:31,399
work we use something like passive DNS
log DNS requests where can we find this

264
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:33,350
sample to run it

265
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:40,520
yeah it's a example the executable ways
on get happy so this is the this is the

266
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,950
get haps dom / press key a high person
six-mile where is free you can download

267
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,059
it

268
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:54,918
of course the syntax is that the one
that didn't read me is yeah okay some

269
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,490
other questions no questions

270
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:08,419
ok let's trick the next guy that will
ask a question will get these sunglasses

271
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:14,750
so this are from million-volt it's quite
interesting keep you are going contact

272
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:21,080
not party store i don't know any kind of
parties because this let me open it yeah

273
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:40,540
so next question okay great i'm actually
I don't have really in question is a

274
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,830
great great

275
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:46,510
well it looks good it looks good
definitely Tessa if you press it again

276
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,960
additional modes so it it can be light

277
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,620
yeah this is greater yeah great

278
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:59,709
ok next question why I don't have any
classes but have something else yeah

279
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,649
next question no are you sure yet one
more great

280
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:16,170
stories off topic but it's about the
classes every everybody anybody tried to

281
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:24,630
replace the lid by infrared food some
face recognition interesting interesting

282
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:31,920
this is for your question yeah you can
pick it up and this is an interesting

283
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,870
logic cube and you can try to solve it
and think outside of the box like any

284
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,280
hacker great

285
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:43,980
next I don't have any any other words
anymore here

286
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:49,200
have you thought about implementing the
dropper in JavaScript something to be

287
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,640
delivered for webpages the dropper

288
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,460
yeah yeah well you can use and classical
or you know representation of a picture

289
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:05,010
in JavaScript and get the EU's after
free as a pay lot and then because it

290
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:09,750
does not have any malicious shellcode
inside then it's a it executes only the

291
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:14,790
subroutine for doing the dns queries and
then it will get that are shellcode

292
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,480
through the IP version 6 addresses and
that's an interesting way to propagate

293
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,480
the dropper they're definitely great

294
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:28,260
ok I there are no more questions thank
you know that it was interesting and fun

295
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,690
and of course see you next time

296
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,050
thank you
