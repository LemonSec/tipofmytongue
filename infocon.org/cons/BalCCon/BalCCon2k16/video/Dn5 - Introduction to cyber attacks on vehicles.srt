1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:25,169
our next guests will tell us about
cyberattacks on vehicles and on car

2
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,910
systems and also hear you he will
present the concept of virtual car

3
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:39,420
please welcome dns hello everyone

4
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:49,050
so as you may already know I'm dns some
of you may know me from my previous

5
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:57,300
speeches at different conferences and
from my blogger or a twitter because

6
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,468
some of you may follow me and thank you
for that so today i'll talk about cyber

7
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:10,229
text on the whole system's it's a real
topic you may not find here on this

8
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:21,570
region so I guess somebody has to do it
so need to be me ideas regarding the the

9
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,439
speaker

10
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:29,880
well I'm a reverse engineer and mother
search or DNS i'm working as a senior

11
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:37,350
software engineer at the and salt
company and of course we are hiring so I

12
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,880
never had the chance to say that if
you're interested we have a lot of

13
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,179
position open and you may play apply it
at our website please if you're

14
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,950
interested in topics about hacking and
security you may tell me at the my

15
00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:00,630
twitter again five and two slashes

16
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:08,030
so I know what what's wrong with
resolution but yeah something is wrong I

17
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,690
guess

18
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:16,340
regarding the topic i guess it's really
for every month so if you have a bit of

19
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:22,459
knowledge about the electronics and
networks you may apply the techniques

20
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:30,380
that I talked about bay in real life
examples so basically the topic is

21
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:39,170
presented for everyone and i will talk
like the in the easiest language i can

22
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:45,768
because jumping in the car security is
not easy and if you have any questions

23
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:54,049
you might as well ask me after the
presentation so what is a car actually

24
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,660
well it's something made for transport
obviously and it's it's really a comp

25
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:12,140
complicated stuff it's a a part of our
everyday life and experience so what why

26
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:20,029
not use it at $TIME ad as their as the
sum some type of security mechanism that

27
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:26,090
will help us in the future and not be
vulnerable as we have the problem with

28
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,940
the world why that right now so as you
already know it's expensive

29
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:42,859
yeah and the main concern about the car
technologies is a stackable so a lot of

30
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:50,329
questions I comp I i get is how do you
actually penetrate the call how do you

31
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,709
explain the car

32
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:58,910
well to be honest it's not as easy as it
said on the movies and on the TV shows

33
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:08,120
as hackers had the car systems so it's
not like that it has a bit of in and out

34
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,800
and you may spend a lot of time to reach
that

35
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,090
the experience to actually do something
with your with your car

36
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,690
so a lot of companies and an automobile
industry became concerned about the car

37
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:37,160
security and the common thing between
the more serious and I and Tesla is that

38
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:44,210
they all have a particular sector and a
company that deals with cause account

39
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:51,380
security and they actually have a type
of hackers that brought the country the

40
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:56,990
system and find vulnerabilities just
like other big companies have in there

41
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,280
in there they have the sectors for
security

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,510
so regarding the connectivity that car
actually lowers in 2016 is various so we

43
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:17,150
have for example their wireless network
connection we have the bluetooth the

44
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:27,380
radio ways and of course the can bus
protocol that give us the root axis as a

45
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:35,570
low level access to the net for which we
can do anything with we want to the car

46
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:47,930
system so i'll talk about canvas mostly
because it gives us the actual access to

47
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,070
the system

48
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:55,580
unfortunately you need to have a
physical access to the system to the

49
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:03,050
vehicle itself because the connectivity
port for the can is in more things that

50
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:12,320
pulls the obd2 and so i'll talk about
little ones get canvas and what it

51
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:20,870
actually does so let's imagine a car in
this example it's a bmv i think in nike

52
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,270
an amateur

53
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:30,880
so we have the canvas the written and
imagine the canvas is a example of the

54
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,090
network protocol that communicates with
the issues and in this example the ACE

55
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:44,289
use electron pump the unit i hope you
all understand this is the type of

56
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:51,190
competition in the deals with particular
operation that cost system actually walk

57
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:59,620
through the can interface or can network
so all these red spots also representing

58
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:06,640
goals are actually asu's that deals with
particular operation are on a car so for

59
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,669
example we have the SU the deals with
wheels and some ace use the deals weed

60
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:19,510
with the door system and so on and so on
with some deals with the video at had

61
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:27,340
lots o yea actually any any operation
sent by the conceit consumer of the car

62
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:38,469
actually transfers through the canvas
and then to the asu so the actually

63
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:45,190
explored this type of things you need to
have a particular mode of access to the

64
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:53,650
to the vehicle itself and the linux
operating system are unsure how many of

65
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,960
you use linux ok windows

66
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:09,880
okay and I six or any other unix-based
ok so most of the of the things that

67
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:17,770
will talk about today is actually tied
to their linux because the linux itself

68
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:26,440
has the module the deals particularly
with a canvas protocol and it gives us

69
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,200
the opportunity to use some of the
solutions and and exploits through there

70
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,880
through the can boss

71
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:42,099
next the next module that kernel itself
operas so i don't know if any in those

72
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:47,170
guys will understand this here but if
you are interested in this topic and

73
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:53,650
think you may already know a lot about
the existence and everything else so

74
00:08:53,650 --> 00:09:01,030
what was the deal with the with linux
and the canvas protocol well as i

75
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:08,230
already said the links offer us a socket
can module which is integrated in the

76
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:16,960
crack kernel itself from the I think 2.8
kernel version and the whole saga

77
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,360
researchers have written the type of
protocol that you may use over the

78
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:30,910
socket can and connect to it to the car
system itself in my particular example

79
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:37,030
I'll talk about the obd2 connectivity
that most of you have already in your

80
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:44,890
car so if you really are interested in
packing the car and exploiting it

81
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:52,420
you may as well use linux for that I'm
currently writing the linux module for

82
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:59,229
sukkot can to the OS six so any OS 6
users here are that are interested and

83
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:05,800
knows about sea and Carol writing may as
well go into the open source project the

84
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,979
second can X on my github account and
I'd really appreciate it

85
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:22,510
so as i already said the circuit can is
a part of the linux kernel and it offers

86
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:31,810
are part of of the 1030 is that we may
use for additional penetration testing

87
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:38,109
and testing the car security so if
you're on you but you you may as well

88
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:45,860
use the comment to get the can utilize
package that is already available in

89
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,040
and the you been to repository

90
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:56,449
it's called can you toes the proper as a
bit of utilities that we may use and

91
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:06,920
that will help us to join the community
of caucus and security and also talk

92
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:14,870
about your car today which is actually
our car engine written and see on top of

93
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:21,800
socket can driver module it's also
available on my github and you may as

94
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,339
well

95
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:30,200
blowing it and perhaps who . do a pull
request because it's something fresh and

96
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,670
so yeah about the about the candles it's
also written by the same most bargain

97
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:45,140
researches and enough for us a lot of
the authorities that we may use it and

98
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:51,949
that i will show you in this
presentation and introduction so I list

99
00:11:51,949 --> 00:12:03,380
I list a few of them here we have the
canned amp which actually just dumps a

100
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:11,660
part of the data that can interface
century we have the can again which is

101
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:18,920
actually a good utility that can help us
to generate random frames which I talk

102
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:27,709
about later to the issues we have the
can send which sends a particular type

103
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:33,979
of frame to the can interface to the asu
and we have the cantilever which is

104
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:42,920
totally cool tool that you may as well
use and i'll talk about it later them so

105
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:49,880
yeah let's see let's see so for example
we all know the cause I accent expensive

106
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:58,920
and the tree may not allow ourselves to
spend a lot of money to buy it

107
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:05,610
a car that will just hack and then
security unit so linux is awesome

108
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:12,060
because it offer our the socket can work
for device which is actually a module

109
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:19,768
and the kernel driver that offer our
work for can device that actually is the

110
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:28,949
same thing that is used in cars so it
makes itself is a car and yeah we can of

111
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:39,120
course link it up and give the give the
module the DD the type and set up as a

112
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:46,949
an interface so shouldn't probably can
to the YP link at that we can 0 that we

113
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:55,199
can I i cannot i can type that just
second let's see

114
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:58,769
so

115
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:06,830
just a second okay for some reason it
doesn't want the speech on to the second

116
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:17,120
desktop but of course so soon what prog
we can actually involved for virtual can

117
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,830
device as you may already know some of
you will excuse me already know what

118
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:27,680
does it do we have the studio are
killing cat the weekend 0y pecan which

119
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:35,209
actually involved SAR particular driver
to the we can interface and it gives our

120
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:41,720
type of link and of course involved a
weekend 0 interface which is in this

121
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:51,110
case the interface we previously set up
and we can of course now use water can

122
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:57,650
you toss that linux offers and itself
the common communicate through there

123
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:05,270
through the weekend 0 device I won't
show you this in details because i'll

124
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:14,540
talk about week our later on so if
you're interested you will see what

125
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,520
happens in the background and how many
you how you may use the work and device

126
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:30,590
someone externals to play with the with
a security and and all of that stuff so

127
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,590
I jumped

128
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:46,129
ok so i think you have I I speak too
much i'll be honest so let's talk about

129
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:53,689
the data that the client interface
actually sent so we have a part of frame

130
00:15:53,689 --> 00:16:00,860
imagine i'm driving a car right here and
if I turn on the headlights that forget

131
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:10,459
the turn-on when I started driving the
route i sent the set of frames to the

132
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:16,849
canvas which then transfers to the asu
that deals with particular operation in

133
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:23,509
this case the headlights so in this
example the driver actually sense the

134
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:32,749
signal for the headlights and it sent to
the canvas and plot to frame which is

135
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:42,170
actually just a part of hex numbers and
hex hex that format and it sent it

136
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:49,699
through the can high and can lo signals
to the can because i don't want to speak

137
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:54,769
about can too much it's really deep
topic and if you're interested that you

138
00:16:54,769 --> 00:17:00,139
might as well learn a lot from the US or
standards about mobile net for can

139
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:05,630
industry so just jump to the frames so
in the frame

140
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:14,959
let's say you have the frame called turn
on the headlights so when the driver and

141
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,620
third operation or press the button to
turn on the headlights the operation is

142
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:27,319
sent to the can as the frame beta turn
on the headlights turn on the headlights

143
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:32,539
turn on the headlights to the ACU and
then the asu knows that it's actually

144
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:39,740
turn on the headlights frame and it does
that particular operation in this case

145
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,940
honor not there yet

146
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:54,560
so let's say how you can use the can you
tell us to sleep the frames and know a

147
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,230
little bit more about your car

148
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:09,170
so how cool is linux well it's really
it's really interesting calculus linux

149
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:14,840
because it offered was the can you toes
and all the necessary things that

150
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:22,850
developers in automobile industry used
to the to write our particular type of

151
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:28,459
friends or the software deal with the
industry itself and the system of the

152
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:36,110
house so I'm just going going to connect
today

153
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,240
fuck ok just second

154
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,299
yeah

155
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,299
yeah

156
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:58,399
ok

157
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,350
yeah

158
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:20,049
ok so i'm currently connected to the to
the ssh on my linux box and we are

159
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:31,749
currently in the aircard directory and
let's let's see the interface of the

160
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:38,259
candidate for Howie how does it looks
like so I'm just going to grab the the

161
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:44,379
very core module which is actually the
car engine that i wrote and so as a

162
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:52,478
military already see II it's linking up
and it uses the PF can protocol that is

163
00:19:52,479 --> 00:20:02,440
actually used in real vehicle systems
and the power engines so how usable is

164
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:10,869
kenya toes actually well let's say if we
bring the Sun device up for example

165
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,930
we can't

166
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:33,800
c1 we can throw at type we can

167
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:45,190
so yeah we just set up our virtual can
device so for example if you actually

168
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:54,550
want to test this on your own car you
may use the the connector obd2 which has

169
00:20:54,550 --> 00:21:02,139
I think the pin number six and number 14
to deal with can high and can load

170
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:09,400
signals so you just connect the device
to the to the computer and to the car

171
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:17,950
itself and its same as you basically
link optic connection as the virtual

172
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:23,560
device about just the real car so we
cannot of course

173
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,840
of fuck

174
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:46,870
yeah so we just linked up our device to
the interface

175
00:21:47,590 --> 00:22:00,789
I mean as an interface so we can as well
carpet and there it is so i'll just show

176
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:07,570
you so you an example of how we can use
can you tells to exploit our own car and

177
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:16,000
vehicle systems really it's easy as in
you are just basically listing the the

178
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,659
frames that are sent to the can
interface to the your your device in our

179
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:28,899
example to the weekend 0 weekend one and
in your examples to the actual cost

180
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:38,799
systems so all the frames that are sent
to the car su through the canvas is

181
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:46,600
actually a frame format which was the
can ID and then the hashtag following

182
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:56,408
the candidate the frame and so basically
if you have the can frame that says that

183
00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:02,409
says unlock the car you may as well
unlock the car so what's the deal we did

184
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:08,409
and where is the security there it's
actually a little bit along the topic

185
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:19,750
that you may that you may listen about
or read about my blog so it's not as

186
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:26,649
easy as it said because all the data
frames format are actually stored in a

187
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:33,399
secure place by the art mobile
industries and the manufactures and most

188
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:41,739
of these car manufactures like the
Mercedes bmv and such actually self the

189
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:48,429
data frames which are like it and don't
lock the car but is used for diagnostic

190
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:52,370
so we you may already know

191
00:23:52,370 --> 00:24:00,260
that most of the cause he for the Rays
are chipped it's actually the particular

192
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:06,650
example that I'm explaining here so it's
or it all is done through the canvas

193
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:14,210
protocol and the data friends which
enables the car to go faster than it

194
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,620
usually goes so

195
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,040
ok i see that my connection drop top

196
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,500
yes

197
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,620
ok

198
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,660
yeah

199
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,389
zing

200
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:03,450
ok so

201
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,620
fuck

202
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
for some reason my VPN drops

203
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,130
yeah

204
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:44,179
I'm pretty sure most of you don't really
understand this

205
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:51,139
did these things but i'm here to give
you a basic introduction because it's

206
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:56,478
actually not easy topic that you may
jump in as for example the web security

207
00:25:56,479 --> 00:26:01,970
lab security or seven side security
because a lot of things are not written

208
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:09,950
by the common factor for obvious reasons
so the guys like me don't try to do

209
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,950
something bad date

210
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:28,320
but of course you may as well start to
learn more about the canvas protocol by

211
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,540
learning the ESO standards from the
cloud mobile industry that will give you

212
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:39,480
a brief introduction there how does the
car actually operates

213
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,360
I mean the new cart newer cars because
your cause actually don't have any

214
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:57,389
particular port that sent the can
signals okay for some example for some

215
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:07,500
reason I don't know my connection drop
soft and know why I leave it as a

216
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,500
reconnecting

217
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:18,610
fuck

218
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,610
ok

219
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,630
I'm really sorry I don't know why this
happens

220
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:38,470
ok so i'll try to reconnect my VPN again
I can't really explain you the basic of

221
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:47,470
introduction and interior introduction
to can interface without linux

222
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,929
ok that's connected to try yeah walk

223
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:11,929
so yeah we have our virtual can device
orgy up which is we can zero weekend

224
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:22,970
want so if we use for example we can
them from the can you tells me as well

225
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:32,360
see the things that helped pass the deal
today through the lifting process so

226
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,520
let's say use the camp with the weekend
0 weekend one

227
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:48,890
ok it's listing up so imagine that we
are currently damping the actually

228
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:55,580
interface from the car to the obd2 port
we will actually write can dump and then

229
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:03,860
the device that are that is configured
in our linux system and that is shown at

230
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:13,790
lspci so the camp is actually a utility
that help us to dump the data that is

231
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:22,820
sent to the can and then to the asu so
for example we can use the also another

232
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:28,250
to from the can you tools called can
again which actually generates random

233
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:36,410
data that will be sent to the can
interface and then on to the asu so for

234
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:46,340
example if we use this it actually sends
a set of frames in the tax form and

235
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:53,689
currently displayed in real life example
the we can zero the first row woodway

236
00:30:53,690 --> 00:31:01,250
actually the first colony would be
actually the interface is the the frame

237
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:09,170
data following by a bite and the data
itself in the hex format so any of these

238
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:12,020
operation may or may not

239
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:20,150
be actually a type of valid frame format
or valid frame data that is actually

240
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:27,440
known by the car or the issue itself so
in this example we are just sending the

241
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,550
rent random type of frames we may as
well use the can again to the interface

242
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:42,830
and send a random type of frame star
real car but I wouldn't advise you the

243
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:50,030
rear car is built for a reason because
breaking the car engine and the system

244
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:58,610
of the automobile is quite the easy
because the can is really primitive

245
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:09,889
technology and it can understand too
much so yeah we have a lot of tools that

246
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:17,240
are actually quite handy when exploiting
the car and can interface we may as well

247
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:25,850
use the can sleep over if i'm correct
the we can 0 device

248
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:32,960
yeah this type of it will t help us the
first set of friends that we pretty fun

249
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:40,280
with the data we are actually interested
in so in this example we are dumping the

250
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:46,430
same data we get from the can again but
we may use the disney for a tool to

251
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:55,010
sniff the particular frame that is
actually some type of operation so I

252
00:32:55,010 --> 00:33:02,030
just thought this right here and i'll
explain a little bit how this can affect

253
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:08,660
the car security and why does it
actually what does it actually have to

254
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:15,740
do with us because well when you look at
this you only see the set of frames with

255
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,660
without any actual validate time and
that's the reason

256
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:29,060
that cause are currently at the security
that they are currently on because if we

257
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:37,610
had the access that data frames sent to
the asu other type of people like

258
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:47,030
blackheads will use it as the as the
actual frame that that there was with

259
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:51,290
particular operation for example it's
just a light vehicle or something like

260
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:58,850
that so i'm pretty sure more a lot of
got a lot of great guys here are

261
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:07,490
interested in the in the car because we
are all meals after all so yeah

262
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:15,739
do not test your own car and like me
that did something like that and not

263
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,449
break your own engine

264
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:23,719
your video is the your car at the
vertical car is actually a car engine

265
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:32,959
which is written in pure see and uses
the bucket can interface then create I a

266
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,139
type of virtual can't wise and it
actually have the available formats just

267
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:42,710
like that just like just like the real
car

268
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:50,090
it actually has the frames that are
available but you actually know what

269
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:56,240
frames are we lit and which data you may
send to do a particular operation which

270
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,770
you can't really do at the Dakar itself

271
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,890
you may but i'll talk about that later

272
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:14,090
so how is the rear car built well it's
simply our setup the virtual can device

273
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:22,610
listen to the to the same device to the
same interface check for frames frames

274
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:29,630
are received part of the frames and
check their daytime and at the end if

275
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,810
the frame is really returned operation
that they sent

276
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:39,940
through the canvas of course you might
as well send available frames just as it

277
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:49,359
can send invalid frames to the actual
car system and such so as I already said

278
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:56,950
we're quite as open source so if any of
you are interested in using this as your

279
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:04,269
laboratory you may write an issue and
i'll be grateful if I can help you with

280
00:36:04,269 --> 00:36:10,240
something you might as well write some
additional function out is like the Reds

281
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,089
the speed and such currently their car
is very limited and it offers just a few

282
00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:24,759
just a few operation that are actually
bailed is the engine on engine of and

283
00:36:24,759 --> 00:36:36,220
the I think door unlock and door lock
these are the veiled frames and women

284
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:45,609
use you use these frames as a type to
communicate with with our device so

285
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:58,660
apart ups and then shape but ok so i
need to use sudo here because it's years

286
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:05,680
as the actually the most pros requires
the pseudo or the appropriate

287
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:17,259
appropriate settings to run the
operation so in this example I run the

288
00:37:17,259 --> 00:37:24,519
aircars pseudo and the device is linked
up we can you can use it conflict to

289
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:31,749
check if all devices up and as you may
already see it's up and we can use the

290
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:38,169
actual all the can utilize that are used
first real car we can use all of them to

291
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:45,700
the rear car and experiment in our
example let's say that we want to send

292
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:56,140
I know around them set the frames we can
use can again to the rear car device and

293
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:02,560
the orbital and general actually
understand the frames and parse them out

294
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,839
so of course

295
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:12,099
mmm none of these frames that are sent
to the issue to the can advise on our

296
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:21,280
vertical car are actually available so
we may use the

297
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,250
or

298
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:31,850
yeah

299
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,750
just think

300
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,010
yeah

301
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,039
yeah

302
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:50,009
ok so these are some set of valid frames
that are actually usable in our care

303
00:38:50,009 --> 00:38:57,929
engine I also write the fuser for the
the same engine it's written Ruby and it

304
00:38:57,929 --> 00:39:06,809
uses can send the said a set of frames
data that it may think it's real it I'll

305
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:08,999
talk about more about that later

306
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:15,629
so for example we can use some of these
frames that are wheeled the test if

307
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:20,459
operations the seed so for example let's
say

308
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:34,680
Cal stop this here so

309
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:56,630
let's say that we use the can sent to
the rear part interface and that they

310
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:05,210
framed at that includes the so this is
can ID so in this example is it's one

311
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:10,100
two tree so can I d can be deal with
particular operation for example the

312
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:15,560
headlights doesn't be doesn't have to be
the separate for example left headlight

313
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:22,759
and the right headlight should be with
the same can ID so if you is the can

314
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:28,400
send 12 free for example for the
headlights or anything else let's say

315
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:45,260
the Bible operation to start a car
engine is 454 e4f for a I think nothing

316
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,589
happens

317
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:53,469
see this this thing reduced to see he
isn't

318
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:01,538
ah yeah it does it's up to a little
resolution so in this example I showed

319
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:10,269
how this frame actually sent available
operation to the ACU in this example

320
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:18,459
it's an on the engine is on and we're
car actually informers that your car

321
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:27,249
engine is turned on and that it's usable
for example the same frame can be used

322
00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:34,509
on the car system if its valence and if
you are connected tape instead of the

323
00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:38,259
year to the base little device

324
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:46,059
yeah so you in a use the vertical canted
to test your knowledge about the car

325
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:52,569
security you are really interested in it
and it i think it's the first car engine

326
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:59,259
written and see that actually registered
the correct flags all of other samples

327
00:41:59,259 --> 00:42:05,859
are actually just the overwrite of the
can sand and other can you toes today to

328
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:14,109
their system so in case you're
interested you may use it and of course

329
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:23,229
try to try to use it in the type of the
open source because it actually is open

330
00:42:23,229 --> 00:42:31,328
source so any any requests for requests
all your parties highly appreciated

331
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:39,999
because just a few of the guys actually
walk with this type of things so i

332
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:44,649
present you the virtual car and how it
can help you to learn more about the car

333
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:54,880
and automobile industry in the IOT world
and so yeah this so it's made its the

334
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,360
progress so actually it actually

335
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:04,480
it opens the can interface over the PF
can which only the linux currently

336
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,920
supports it without external models
windows supported but you have danced

337
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:15,040
for some additional DLLs and or six is
totally out of this region and you mean

338
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:23,440
either use virtual machine or hopping
and and rewrite the linux kernel model

339
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:31,390
with me and Carlo poop which is actually
sever security firm that do deals with

340
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:38,440
the car security only so on the part of
it and we are writing this same circuit

341
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,360
camera to the is-6 I know if any of you
right

342
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:52,480
white six drivers but yeah so I also
wrote your car fuser it's sort of a

343
00:43:52,480 --> 00:44:00,730
script and actually fuse your car your
car with the random strings actually

344
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:08,500
from the word list that the it also low
the generation and it's highly

345
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:15,790
customizable and it attacks the can
protocol and cannot folks so I know

346
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:22,660
ruby is quite easy so you may join in
and rewrite some of the tools or try to

347
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:29,230
think about additional things that that
can help other car hawkers the music

348
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:36,820
band and practice on it's actually a
tool a simple to it's based on can your

349
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:42,760
thoughts actually can send and it
actually sent the frame converted from

350
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:49,510
the board list for the hex on to the can
interface to the ACO in this case the

351
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:57,160
your car engine so i'm not sure if you
are interested in showing you the d-mail

352
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:02,620
demo for the week off user I don't think
it's that my Jimmy check it as well my

353
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,830
github

354
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:06,830
learn a lot of things from it

355
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:14,750
yeah this is how it's made so it's
actually fuse it uses a conf rain to the

356
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:21,830
borderless onto the canvas interface and
then to the rear car is then work our

357
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:27,980
checks if the frame is valid and then
returns to the fuser if the operation is

358
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:33,980
the seed or not it's really primitive
and simple but it's expensive able and

359
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,920
yeah that's about it

360
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,350
I I don't want to take too much time
about regarding the work our future and

361
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:50,480
i will talk about something else in this
example the real-life attacks as far as

362
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,240
i know most of the speech that deals
with car hacking and car security

363
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:03,020
actually don't provide any real-life
attack and examples and if some of the

364
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:09,920
some of the people question about it
that listen that that particular talk

365
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,460
the their ignore it or or or I know they
don't want transferred because most of

366
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:22,070
the guys that the LCD because security
are actually in the car industry itself

367
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:29,330
so they don't want to rebel their own
secret so I'm here to dance for you

368
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:33,680
although all the questions you have
regarding this because i'm not in kind

369
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:41,270
especially thankfully we have we have a
part of the team of you is to attack the

370
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:48,590
the car vehicle itself but it's not as
it said or thin isn't in movies

371
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:55,550
so what for the first thing why it's not
advisable because well cards are

372
00:46:55,550 --> 00:47:01,070
expensive you can break the the car
system the car engine and order stuff

373
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:07,100
like the ACE use or just the various
thing that you don't want to deal with

374
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:13,910
two don't want to pay for additionally
you may you is the for example if you

375
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:14,879
want to

376
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,519
teach yourself more about some something
in particular car for example if you

377
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:28,618
want to learn more about the dash for
the headlights four-day door of the car

378
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:35,519
you may just use because the AC with
that is built with that particular door

379
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:40,769
so yeah if you really want to try
something about this in real life

380
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:50,578
example my mind's for is done to it but
if your argument is i don't care i want

381
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:53,910
to break my car or I want to try this
one

382
00:47:53,910 --> 00:48:02,609
so these are the fuel you type of
so-called were not abilities that you

383
00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:09,990
may use actually none of these are
vulnerability it's for example the BBC

384
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:19,529
Saudi see what is DC it's actually a
format of the of the that holds all the

385
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:26,069
frames friend I data for a particular
car model and all these frames are

386
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:36,000
veiled for example you have a no mercy
is not BBC that holds all the frames for

387
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:44,039
that particular mother of your cities
and you actually can send the BBC frame

388
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:51,750
data actually the frame data from the
DBC file to the canvas and then that

389
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:54,180
operational magically appear

390
00:48:54,180 --> 00:49:02,759
that's actually how most of the
diagnostic tool works so they have a

391
00:49:02,759 --> 00:49:08,369
part of the database that checks only
for error checks that you may not use

392
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:14,819
additionally unlock the car the I know
for example for the engine or something

393
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:23,670
like that they have just to see if the
frame is available and is it ok then the

394
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,210
agnostic car diagnostic returns

395
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:32,210
turns the one actually doesn't return
anything but the frame past and its veil

396
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:39,140
it so that that type of thing is okay in
case if some frame is sent

397
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:45,710
but is not seeing to the asu then
there's something wrong with your car

398
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:49,670
and that's actually the car diagnostic
it's not some kind of magic

399
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:58,848
it's actually pretty easy so the DBC
file are actually on the cap on the on

400
00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:07,940
the manufacturers in south and to the
some type of all be the software is on

401
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:12,980
something like that pays a huge amount
of money so they can use the same slot

402
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:19,310
for to the agnostic or the whole so the
BBC is actually a great hacking

403
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:26,810
technique but it's not available to us
people that doesn't deal with car

404
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:33,080
security too much or something like that
we have the trial and error which is

405
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:41,420
obviously the the type of hunting that
we use every day most of developers use

406
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:47,960
this as a type to fix the bug or
something so trial and error is and

407
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:58,040
essential if you have a su connected to
the canvas and to the operation so for

408
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,990
example if you disconnect that a short
that device of course that frame 1 be

409
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:08,029
avail it so there you get there you have
it that's the frame that is really

410
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:12,230
really then that you may use to
penetrate the car or something

411
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:18,560
this is actually a quiet the technique
but it's it takes too long to learn more

412
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:26,810
about it and the you have really to be
precise to the car model that you will

413
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:33,200
test and such and takes a lot of fun and
I think most of you don't have

414
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:39,049
additional hobby time so we also have a
buzzing technique

415
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:47,960
which is actually used by the aircar
bother you just try to permanent the car

416
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:53,930
system by various frames that you may
see more stiff and that you may think

417
00:51:53,930 --> 00:52:02,120
they are available so I i think chris
miller shows an example of this if you

418
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:08,630
have a frame that you slipped before and
see our petition of that frame through

419
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:16,040
the canvas protocol that means that that
can frame is actually for some reason

420
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:22,790
it's usable and you might as well cried
too can send it to do can interface and

421
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:30,200
check what has happened with your car if
you send it so using is of course along

422
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:36,230
taking technique and it's the only
technique that may actually break your

423
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:43,040
car for example DBC want to break your
causes the things our way lit and the

424
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,390
trial-and-error are actually a
fundamental thing that you make check

425
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:50,390
you may break your car but not that much

426
00:52:51,260 --> 00:53:01,040
so let's say so yeah i'm currently also
writing a type of can you tell

427
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:07,250
additionality that will have a similar
this scene the can you tools have the

428
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:11,480
cans before it's a great tool but it
doesn't give us too much information

429
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:17,300
about the traffic that we sniffed so i'm
currently building at all that will

430
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:23,480
actually save the traffic then actually
when you disconnect the device it will

431
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:30,920
show you a kind of diff what changed
between the operation that to deal with

432
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:36,560
before he disconnected your device and
after you disconnected your device

433
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:42,560
this will help with trail and error
panic to actually penetrate your car and

434
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:49,430
explore additional vulnerabilities say
yeah that's the yeah this is the

435
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:52,190
explanation of the

436
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:58,010
of the engine is currently private I get
that but i hope i'll release it soon one

437
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:08,690
side finished with the car loop and
module four by six so using i think most

438
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:15,530
of you will now come home and think
about well let's try the can comment on

439
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:16,819
my car

440
00:54:16,819 --> 00:54:22,220
well I can only say you don't do that
because I'm not responsible for anything

441
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:29,720
you do it will actually break your car
that's how they automobile industry

442
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:36,078
protect themselves from this type of
attacks so yeah this is a little bit

443
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:44,119
more about the DBC it's actually hold it
actually holds really frames but

444
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:49,130
unfortunately it's not it's not
available to us

445
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:58,220
of course I may also it say that some of
the BBC file for older models are leaked

446
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:05,328
and either sold to the black market or
they are available if you would try to

447
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:11,960
search for the . b or someone other
websites too much 42 deep

448
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:18,950
yeah they are available but hardly to
find for new new models and newer type

449
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:26,030
yeah of course i'd like to thank my
sponsors so yeah and soft it's the

450
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:31,760
company i granted workers start bending
it we have the opening position it's a

451
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,760
huge company and you're welcome to join
us

452
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:40,700
we are located in bosnia and herzegovina
and the spark that grant response oars

453
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:49,368
also my talk to Carlo up is the company
located in Silicon Valley that I do walk

454
00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:56,780
with in so it's a rewrite all the stuff
that are available to linux and windows

455
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:02,970
to the always six the known server of
course my sponsors that

456
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:11,490
offer me VPS and the service for the
hacking but I do and local startup

457
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:15,750
called grab the bomb which mail check

458
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:19,110
additionally i want to speak about too
much it's a coupe

459
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:26,310
yeah so that's it I know if you have any
questions but I'm here to answer for you

460
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:33,060
i know this kind of hard topic to get
jump in but you have heard much to learn

461
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:36,060
about it

462
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:47,550
thank you have you thought about getting
some ECU's from like partial ebay and

463
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:52,650
emulating the farmer like dumping him
emulating them and putting them as a

464
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:57,300
module into your virtual car so you can
actually feels real firmware without

465
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,040
damaging too many cars

466
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:09,060
oh well yeah I thought about it but yeah
is the actual problem with the how to

467
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:14,400
say that the frames are actually not the
frames that means something for example

468
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:20,400
in vertical collar the frame for engine
on is a non in the hex format but in the

469
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:28,050
actual card the frame for example engine
on is some render character or something

470
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:35,610
like that so you can't really know what
the frame actually does if you don't

471
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:41,970
expect too much for example for one
frame to give it to too much time to

472
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:47,669
explore it and to learn how you can use
that frame in your own engine but i hope

473
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:55,170
so to implement the way of the public
DBC files to the little car and for

474
00:57:55,170 --> 00:58:02,760
example if you want the engine for the
order so it will only be available for

475
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,630
the specific frames for that ford model
or something like that so in the future

476
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:10,470
yes of course but you may as well join
to the project and

477
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:19,260
maybe it was thinking is always the same
frame so command for instance to turn

478
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:24,900
the engine on it always just one frame
or maybe they're like ours where there

479
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,930
is a combination of frames that turns
the engine or like you have to send

480
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:30,839
three frames into question their charity

481
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:36,660
well the problem with a with the can
frame sees yes there are always the same

482
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:41,190
because the technology of the can
interface and cannot walk is primitive

483
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:48,060
and it can't understand if the frame is
actually just an ally is for that

484
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:56,820
particular operation but the thing is
that the frame itself actually that sent

485
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:03,780
through the can pass to the ACU in
repetative order so it's not like turn

486
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:07,440
turn the engine on and that's that

487
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:13,080
no it's if your engine is turn on then
you may inspect your frame that deals

488
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:18,690
with the engine on because you'll see
the apartment of feet repeating you know

489
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:24,090
in the industry for war or the dumping
the data so the engine on we'll just

490
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:28,620
sent engine on engine on engine on
engine on engine on and then you may as

491
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:35,370
well inspect a bit that that particular
frame is actually an engine on frame the

492
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:38,370
two menu is additionally

493
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:44,630
any other questions

494
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:56,120
thank you
