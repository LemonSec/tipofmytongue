1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:21,010
hello everybody

2
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:27,280
short announcement they will be Q&A
session after this lecture so if you at

3
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,640
the moment don't have a questions but
you have at the end

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,620
please go to the mic stay in line and
ask her questions so if it's okay with

5
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:42,399
you are today's lecture does not compute
why dr. skate IT it will be delivered by

6
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:49,929
Christina choose from Germany and she's
a expert and she writes articles for

7
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:54,100
medical informations so please give a
warm welcome to Christina enjoy

8
00:00:55,089 --> 00:01:00,429
yeah thanks for having me

9
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:10,330
um and as you said this is talk about
medical doctors and the use of IT and

10
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:19,690
why is this topic at all and in health
care there is increasing digitalization

11
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:25,960
like in other fields and if for example
you think about how much the field of

12
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:33,100
communication or transport or
entertainment has been revolutionized by

13
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:40,030
the use of the internet and
interconnectedness and then you would

14
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:49,150
expect the same for the field of headcam
so there are vast possibilities

15
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,960
if you think about it

16
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:04,020
however compared to other fields
digitization it's a bit as a bitch

17
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:11,160
fallen behind in the field of the future
of healthcare so basically this is what

18
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:22,920
we want and this is what we have what we
have are clunky user interfaces like

19
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:32,130
this one and like of user friendliness
and if you walk into a hospital and you

20
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:43,560
look at the applications of the the
majority's still looks like this so

21
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,960
yeah

22
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:59,060
there has been a recent survey among
German doctors i have pulled some quotes

23
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:07,940
from that and something that German
doctors at least and often say is that

24
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,220
they expect digitalization to increase
but they cannot yet see how they

25
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,990
themselves or their patients with profit
from it either financially or otherwise

26
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:28,130
another objection that is made very
often is that a digitization involves

27
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,970
too much bureaucracy which is kind of a
paradox because if you look at other

28
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:41,240
fields then through the use of the
internet there has been less bureaucracy

29
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:50,210
like for example nowadays when you book
a room through airbnb and there is for

30
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:56,600
you this less paperwork to be done then
when you booked a hotel room of the

31
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:03,859
traditional way 20 years ago but this is
not yet the case in half camp then

32
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:12,800
another thing that is a thought quite
often is where doctors understandably um

33
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:20,239
put much emphasis on the importance of
the doctor-patient relationship as a

34
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:29,450
personal relationship and they feel
that's the use of digital methods does

35
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,430
not support the development of
relationships but somehow gets in the

36
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:41,330
way or supposed to replace it again this
is not necessary if you look at other

37
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:49,400
fields and like instant messaging for
example has done a lot to make personal

38
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,409
relationships easier and

39
00:04:53,409 --> 00:05:01,330
then they often fear that patients and
require some kind of pseudo knowledge

40
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:07,929
from surfing the web like asking dr.
Weaver for diagnosis and and then they

41
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:17,948
have to work to correct this diagnosis
if it is wrong this is I think of valid

42
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:24,099
objection sometimes but on the other
hand there are new and all there could

43
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:31,628
be new resources for patient education
and that are better than just googling

44
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:38,169
random websites but also this field is
not as well developed as it could be

45
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:44,828
then of course and that's the objection
of data privacy which is very important

46
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:46,360
i will come back to that later

47
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:53,050
and another thing is that healthcare
professionals feel that other patients

48
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,599
and there are of course a lot of them
because we but the older we get the

49
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:05,229
sticker we get and they cannot keep up
with the technological development and

50
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:15,669
this is also true i think but something
that will be resolved by and by as we as

51
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:22,209
digital natives also get all inch seeker
but today it is suddenly a valid

52
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:25,260
objection

53
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:32,640
so i have defined fewer five problem
fields that are responsible for the

54
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:39,690
objections that medical professionals
have towards the use of IT the first one

55
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:46,620
is the problem of his ability and you
saw that user interface earlier and this

56
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:55,140
year our data from a Soviet among us
doctors and the majority say that I'm

57
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,789
the electronic health record system in
their organization is hard to use

58
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:06,210
yeah and you have to remember that these
are all people that I'm went to

59
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:12,870
university more or less successfully and
they basically have been using computers

60
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,970
for a long long time in their private
lives and professional lives and still

61
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:26,310
they are finding it hard to use and in
accordance with that when asked what is

62
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:32,190
most important to improve and actually
improved patient care through the use of

63
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:38,219
IT the most important thing is to
improve functionality and ease-of-use

64
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:52,350
because when you have a bad user
interface and you have to use it in

65
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:59,430
situations where there is a time
pressure and you have to act for the

66
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:07,050
sake of patients lives or head then it
is critical that you don't get confused

67
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,260
always anytime or have misunderstandings
that lead to worse patient care

68
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:26,919
something that follows from these bad
user interfaces and and also from a lack

69
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:38,950
of time is that sometimes workflows
using IT in hospitals are a bit curious

70
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:47,680
as as I said and there's often a time
pressure and that's often lack of

71
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:55,689
resources in hospitals and a lack of
personnel and that's basically too much

72
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:03,580
to be done in too little time and when
there are new people on staff often they

73
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:11,530
are just dropped onto the station and
they said through your work and if they

74
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,510
are lucky they will maybe find an
experienced nurse and who takes three

75
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:21,640
minutes to show them how to log into the
system but they're often often there is

76
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,310
a lack of a rigorous training and so
people are trying around and figure it

77
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:33,400
out for themselves and this situation
like this is off another result

78
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:46,650
so just a side thought that I mentioned
earlier and as ask digital natives I'm

79
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:54,930
not only get older and get sick but also
get old enough to have responsible roles

80
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:03,270
in healthcare and we are more used to
employing IT to solve our problems then

81
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:10,620
the generations before us and as so it
gets a little bit easier even if use

82
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:19,410
abilities not improved but still and the
majority of the progress is to be had if

83
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:26,370
usability is actually improved so the
second problem field is the lack of

84
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:34,560
resources that i am already mentioned
and this is again this us survey these

85
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,979
doctors were asked if the use of ideas
actually increased or decreased the

86
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:48,720
amount of time spent with patients and
the majority Holland or thought that it

87
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,470
had decreased the amount of time spent
with patients again this is not of

88
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,750
course as it should be because I tea
should be there to make our lives easier

89
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:11,880
and not to get in the way of actually
accomplishing things and as many

90
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,340
healthcare professionals doctors and
nurses rightly say and their primary

91
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:24,660
goal is to interact with patients to
talk to them to take a correct history

92
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,260
and

93
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:31,410
to make a diagnosis to be procedures on
them and not to figure out how the IT

94
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,630
system is supposed to work

95
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:44,550
so that's the second outfield now to the
cart and the third feared problem field

96
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:53,400
is the perceived questioning of
authority this again another data

97
00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:00,689
sources published in a German General
for medical doctors that's the blood and

98
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:10,680
they said that earlier and maybe 20
years ago the medical professionals were

99
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:19,290
actually they were defining how medicine
was supposed to work and all related

100
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:26,250
fields they were just the actual support
the to support patient care and support

101
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:34,020
the results and in the supporting fields
I mean medical informatics quality

102
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:41,400
management etc so this was basically an
autonomy in the field of medicine and

103
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:49,350
this author hypothesized that today
there are these formerly supported

104
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:54,090
fields that have now taken over and an
hour prescribing how to practice

105
00:12:54,090 --> 00:13:04,860
medicine without actually being a
medical professional among them IT

106
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,210
professionals

107
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,780
this is

108
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:14,569
where this is just the opinion of this
author it's it's not necessarily correct

109
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:20,210
and you have to look at it more closely
but it is often a situation like this is

110
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,250
often quoted as an objection

111
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:30,170
why and they don't want increased use of
IT one example is the use of the IBM

112
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:38,510
supercomputer Watson which is nowadays
also used to find a medical diagnosis

113
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:48,200
and in this context it is referred to as
dr. Watson and the workflow is basically

114
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:57,020
like this and the dr watson receives
from the physician a data about the

115
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:04,280
patient signs and symptoms then
independently it searches the clinical

116
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,050
databases for example the patient
history that has been entered earlier

117
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:16,760
the family history the current drugs etc
then when the patient has entered the

118
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:26,480
hospital other procedures performed that
results in a new data like lab work or

119
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:34,610
ideology pictures and dr watson also
includes these and presents then it's

120
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:41,780
goes and yeah on the web to search for
medical literature and medical

121
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:48,800
guidelines then it takes together all of
these data to analyze it and to form

122
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,640
hypotheses it makes a list of hypotheses
and that is a list of probable diagnosis

123
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,480
and every diagnosis gets a certain
probability and then it outputs this

124
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,140
list of diagnosed

125
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:11,710
however not every one of these steps is
invisible for the user from the outside

126
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:17,110
and so sometimes it looks like kind of a
black box or something that you

127
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:25,810
something that has no transparency or if
if it had transparency it would maybe

128
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:35,469
look too complicated to understand it
within a reasonable amount of time and

129
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:44,560
so this if if you rely your decisions on
something that you do not understand and

130
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,589
then this of course leads to the
objection

131
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,130
what if the computer is wrong

132
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:58,420
who's responsible that's the next
problem huge the question of

133
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:07,540
responsibility there and i'm not sure
about the situation in

134
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:15,350
about the situation internationally but
I think in most assistance that have

135
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:24,980
actually discussed this problem the
major opinion is that if a doctor or

136
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:31,550
someone as decides to use a decision
support system then he or she is

137
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:38,630
responsible is still responsible for the
outcome and not well of course not the

138
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:46,010
computer because a put a computer in
jail or feel more anything if it is

139
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:52,430
wrong and there of course and some
exceptions like when you can prove that

140
00:16:52,430 --> 00:17:00,739
the manufacturer has done something
wrong but the basic principle is you

141
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,420
decide to use the decision support
system and in after this decision you

142
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,420
are responsible for the outcome

143
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:19,040
yeah however on the more and more of
these support systems are in and

144
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:26,359
practical use and the more people feel
that maybe they will have pressure to

145
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:35,479
use them in the future so that they are
under the suspicion of being not

146
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,310
responsible and not thorough enough if
they decide not to use the computer

147
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,720
system and so if they feel the pressure
to use the system but they are still

148
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:52,130
responsible for the outcome it leads to
kind of unfair situation and this is why

149
00:17:52,130 --> 00:18:00,080
i'm still going back to this survey from
extension many of the respondents and

150
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,830
set that they are concerned about the
impact of the use of IT on the actual

151
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:15,600
and treatments quality and the amount of
errors so and on to the last problem

152
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:22,379
which is of course the problem of
privacy and security and this is

153
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:31,289
something that you will still often see
in hospitals and private practices this

154
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:35,100
is not because people don't know any
better

155
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:41,070
in most cases but i think the most
important reason is as I said earlier

156
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:48,000
the lack of time and lack of resources
and because that's always you always

157
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:56,190
have to find a compromise between
convenience and security and if you have

158
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,630
too little time to do your job you will
usually take the shortcut and say the

159
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:07,440
convenient route and not the same food
and which leads to situations like this

160
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:20,309
and you probably know this is one here
it says that your security mechanisms

161
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:29,190
for your cryptography can in theory be
excellent and uncrackable but if you

162
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:35,730
find an easy way of brute force way
around it then it's not worth anything

163
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:46,260
and yeah this is a study from the sense
institute which most of you probably

164
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:53,070
also know they did report on cyber
threats and healthcare and ask people

165
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,300
what they thought was already efficient
in the organizations and what was not

166
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:03,480
and i will not go through all of this in
detail about something for example

167
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,470
that's interesting is that most people
are skeptical about the security of

168
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:14,250
electronic medical devices which is
supported and I think my recent news

169
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:19,410
because there are more and more medical
devices in the news that have some kind

170
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:26,160
of backdoor vulnerability and people are
also skeptical about Big Data

171
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,420
initiatives and the exchange of data
with other organizations

172
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:42,210
yeah so the sentencing huge approach
some examples from the web for example

173
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:49,260
for example here someone did not bother
to change the admin credentials and

174
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:56,640
there was easy login if you know what to
look for and it's actually easy to look

175
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,460
for it because if you just search for
the type of the device you want to

176
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:10,440
access and the words before password
then he would often have a useful result

177
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:21,570
and as they say this isn't even taking
this is just googling so and this was um

178
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:27,929
now what I wanted to say about this if
you are interested in the subject I have

179
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,549
more literature

180
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:37,350
just ask me in person or send me an
email and now I would be very interested

181
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:43,529
in hearing your thoughts on the subject
and to answer any questions thank you

182
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,690
yeah

183
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,610
yeah

184
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:06,540
type it was an interesting view from
your side as a doctor I am myself a

185
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:15,570
software developer and even I'm did I
didn't work directly on medical softer I

186
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:24,389
have friends for work on this kind of
programs and one of their problems is

187
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:36,690
the the standards and certificates that
you need to have or I don't force field

188
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:46,140
to make this kind of program and
sometimes he's so hard to focus on the

189
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:52,830
interface when you have to do this kind
of testing and this kind of you have two

190
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:59,760
discs a kind of proof technology and
it's so hard work when you make it a

191
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:07,710
change to deliver it very fast and there
is there are a lot of absolute

192
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:13,020
technologies that are in productions
only because there is this bureaucracy

193
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:19,740
between the dealer developer and
end-user yeah yeah that's that's very

194
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:26,669
true and it's good that you brought the
subject because there's something I

195
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:31,710
forgot to say and I actually wanted to
have a shot

196
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,360
lightning talk about this but there are
no lightning talks there is an issue

197
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:43,320
initiative called and i am the cavalry
and and they are not only working in the

198
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:49,770
healthcare field but also in the
automotive field but when I just know

199
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,889
about healthcare and they suggested a

200
00:23:52,890 --> 00:24:00,540
Hippocratic oath for connected medical
devices which includes a suggestion of

201
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:07,320
having more standards and especially
more standards that are already approved

202
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:14,280
in other industries and if you're
interested you can maybe go and look at

203
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,280
their website

204
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:38,290
hi so mentions actually talked about
doctors having problems with patients

205
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:47,170
googling symptoms and stuff at home and
kind of coming up with some wrong on

206
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:54,730
diagnostics and but what you think about
websites like WebMD and mobile

207
00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:01,600
applications that are aimed at patients
and not doctors themselves

208
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,230
is this something that should continue
or should like medical ITA software be

209
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:15,460
only in that doctors in the flavor if
you ask for my personal opinion and I

210
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,500
think they are useful if they are
quality if somehow the quality is

211
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,610
certain and there are some
certifications to make sure that there

212
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:34,030
is nothing nothing wrong on these sites
and because they lead to more

213
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:40,000
responsibility on the side of the
patients and however not every patient

214
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,230
is able to use these resources and but
as i said earlier as our generation gets

215
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:52,030
older there are more and more patience
while I'm willing and able to look up

216
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:59,170
there and diseases in internet resources
so I'm i think i think this is useful

217
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:06,700
and I think it's used will increase in
the future i think there will always be

218
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:13,150
some problems connected with it like a
patient's being convinced that they have

219
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:18,790
something that they don't but some
doctors are afraid of this

220
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:26,970
but i think this is not this is not a
new risk this is something that can also

221
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:35,130
happen when patients use other
information resources so yeah in summary

222
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:41,190
i think my personal opinion is that it's
a good thing if the quality is good

223
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:48,150
enough and yeah so do you still
recommend going to a doctor in real life

224
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,350
after still $TIME after like doing your
own research at home

225
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:02,040
well yes of course but yea yea this this
is an interesting question because as a

226
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:07,020
medical professional in the moment in
which you say no you don't have to go to

227
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,650
see a doctor then you are responsible
for the outcome if you if you will be

228
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:19,530
your symptoms and I tell you no no you
don't have to go to the doctor it's it's

229
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,530
just a migraine and you go home and drop
dead and it's my fault

230
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:30,480
so if you ask a professional and he or
she will probably very only very rarely

231
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,830
say you can save his stay at home and
not not go to

232
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,920
yeah

233
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:52,129
you were talking about the quality of
the user interfaces and that many

234
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,130
doctors complain that the software is
difficult to use

235
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,390
what do you think is the reason why this
hasn't improved in a lot of time

236
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:05,660
couldn't some medical software company
just get five people from apple and five

237
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,440
people from google and make a super user
interface where do you think is the

238
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,309
difficulty

239
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:16,700
that's an interesting question and
something that I really don't know

240
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:27,260
anything i say is pure speculation and I
think it may be because it is kind of

241
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:35,750
regulated market and it's not a monopoly
but a market with very few players and

242
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:43,250
the development at what's becoming more
user-friendly is something that usually

243
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:48,590
starts and consumer oriented companies
and maybe they don't have the resources

244
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:56,240
or the incentives to go and play in the
medical market that would be my first

245
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:02,780
guess but honestly I can't really say do
you think it would help if doctors would

246
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:09,889
complain more to the developers of the
software that they use suddenly then to

247
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,390
some complaining

248
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:18,289
yes that's the single direction do do
more complaining and you will get better

249
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:23,450
user interfaces I think that's that may
be a true statement generally

250
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,300
yeah

251
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:44,100
so there are no more questions now I'm
understood

252
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:47,909
yeah

253
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,949
okay great presentation thanks for being
here on you mention in your presentation

254
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:05,580
IBM Watson AK dr. Watson how it operates
you call the black box right and you you

255
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:14,820
mention our problem for as i remember
our responsibility right so do you guys

256
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,480
are you

257
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:23,159
is it mandatory in Germany are you guys
forced to use this kind of technologies

258
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:28,470
no not at all matter lon and this is
what this was something that is in

259
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:36,870
professional adequate about this subject
that is often cited as an objection that

260
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:45,059
I t is developing to what are replacing
doctors already is replacing important

261
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:50,940
functions but this is by far not
something that has happened yet

262
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:56,700
I mean you know how it operates right
but still it's not enough transparency

263
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:06,480
to the real doctors they generate a
carton board whatever you get the

264
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,630
complete history of diseases for a
patient right but it's based on some

265
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:18,360
other research not for our a specific
country not for a germany for example

266
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:24,389
right so they collect all the data and
they can generate some kind of answer

267
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:31,320
for that the patient you have for
example so what-what are you your

268
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,559
thoughts and that and

269
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:44,100
hows it shone I mean the percentage of
successful rate for for curing the

270
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:54,090
patients I think it's at the stage where
you have a clinical decision support and

271
00:31:54,090 --> 00:32:01,529
the the current questions not yet and
how much does it improve outcomes for

272
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:06,029
patients but the first question is and
is it more accurate and finding a

273
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:11,820
diagnosis than human and that's the
first question John question to answer

274
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,019
and is still had enough a question and
the other question of which improves

275
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:26,190
outcomes comes afterwards and where the
the question why it may be perceived as

276
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:34,320
a black box if we're the reason why you
want to use dr. Watson is one of the

277
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,649
reasons is that it can go online and
analyze the medical literature and the

278
00:32:40,649 --> 00:32:46,379
guidelines and do this more extensively
and more efficiently than a human code

279
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:58,590
and at that moment when it performs
better than human then the human cannot

280
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:04,619
judge its ability anymore because and
there's dr. Watson and dr. Watson has

281
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:12,869
read 5,000 advocates on disease x and i
have only read thirteen and he comes to

282
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:18,509
a different conclusion than i do and
then I don't know is it because he got

283
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:23,789
all this useful information from the
five thousand papers and all the 4900

284
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:27,299
something that i have read or is it
because something went wrong on the way

285
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:33,119
so you guys are filled obviously use
some sort of systems like dr. Watson

286
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:35,970
right they they are in

287
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:42,360
use and some hospitals and I don't work
in a hospital apparently so are our day

288
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:49,260

transporting yeah that's the question

289
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:58,560
and how do you want to judge this need
personally I i tend to trust in the

290
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:04,050
system even if it's especially if it
performs better than I can

291
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:11,940
but there are some some limits are there
should be some kind of independent

292
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:19,500
quality control to make sure that there
are no pacts supplies you can ever have

293
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:27,510
no box and but no no I'm very important

294
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,030
