1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:28,830
welcome to our next talk magic will talk
a lil shows a little bit and tell us

2
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,849
about the combination of Technology and
biology welcome thank you for the

3
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,210
introduction and today i would like to
tell you something about said coupling

4
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,390
and which is an important topic for
applications like implants and processes

5
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:55,800
at the beginning i would like to give
you a general mood elevation so um the

6
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:03,209
topic of cum combining electronics was a
biology plays an important role in

7
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,630
different fields of life so for example
the research of diseases in case of the

8
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,250
isomer disease for example or the
Parkinson's disease from a pelagic

9
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,479
studies we have that topic also in the
media lots of you will know things like

10
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:30,600
new Mansa star trek avatar metrics we
have a vivid and developing field of

11
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,360
biohacking like do-it-yourself biology
do-it-yourself genomics body and

12
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,900
enhancements and of course the idea of
size box in the place also role in

13
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,869
ethics and sociology or in sports and of
course in the field I talk today about

14
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:54,990
implants and proteus so we'll give you
an overview about my talk at the

15
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,658
beginning i will introduce you to some
general parameters which are important

16
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,210
for and the set chip coupling and in the
end i will shortly talk about some

17
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,869
example

18
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:13,930
some devices like the retinal implant
the cochlear implant or deep brain

19
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,730
stimulation

20
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:23,200
so um at the beginning if you would like
to combine and electrical signal or

21
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,980
electronics with human material

22
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,970
um if you are always meet in between a
kind of insulator so on the one hand you

23
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:40,150
have like assets your neurons tissue and
on the other hand the computer system

24
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:46,420
and in between you need sensor or
transducer which transforms your signal

25
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:54,549
in another form so let's take a look
first on the biologic system and the

26
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,560
principal in question here is how do
cells actually communicate in general

27
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,350
they are two ways to communicate here
it's from the chemical way in form of

28
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,380
neurotransmitters and the electric away
in form of action potentials in my talk

29
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,660
I were in focus more on the action
potentials because the electrical

30
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:24,040
signals in your body a crucial for
applications like implants so um an

31
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,470
extra potential is rapid and local
change in the membrane potential em in

32
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,000
the image in the middle you can see me
example measurement of action potentials

33
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,000
so remember in potential is changing
from values like minus $OPERAND and

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,200
fifty million words up two values around
plus 30 millivolts and towers the action

35
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,630
potential created in general its
potential difference between the

36
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:58,989
extracellular and intracellular space or
which means the space inside and outside

37
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:06,220
the cell and this potential difference
is created by the difference and iron

38
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:12,489
concentrations so um how does this
difference happen

39
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:13,930
mmm

40
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:20,978
in the cell membrane you always have a
different receptor proteins or gated

41
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:27,070
channel proteins which are sensitive to
different similarly like a chemical

42
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:34,630
similarly temperature mechanical stress
strain and so on so on the example of

43
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:43,300
voted sensitive chance you have like a
protein which is sensitive to the change

44
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:51,070
in membrane potential and if it detects
the change in potential lead

45
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:57,969
jenna is opening and such as entering
the Emmy ability of the membrane for

46
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:08,860
different species and towers such a
signature and submitted em also here in

47
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,699
general we have two kinds of cell
interfaces on the one hand the chemical

48
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:20,889
interface the mechanic signups the
common application here are the

49
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:27,220
transmission of signals happens here via
neurotransmitters as i mentioned at the

50
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:34,240
beginning and second we have the
electrical synapse the am so cord gap

51
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:41,050
junction and here the action potential
is transmitted over a direct contact

52
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:49,690
between two cells in the video you can
see a calcium imaging and recording

53
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:55,810
which means if action potential happens
there's always change in intracellular

54
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:03,669
calcium so if you stayin yourself for a
change and calcium you can indirectly

55
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:11,620
observe the action potential so in the
video you can see how the electrical

56
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,470
signals are propagating through a
conference of missile layout which means

57
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,750
the sets in the video are in tight
contact and

58
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:31,800
and the electric signals are transmitted
to explain you shortly the electrical

59
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:40,770
description of a cell so I'm first the
to describe the membrane you can use the

60
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,830
so-called much can actually element
which is the equivalent circuit for a

61
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:55,349
cell membrane you have their the
membrane capacity and also different

62
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:01,290
conductivities for the different ein
species and of course also for the

63
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:09,240
different membrane potentials if you
would like to describe the transmission

64
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,930
of the signal along the cell you can use
the equivalent circuit of a coke so

65
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:24,780
cable and which mean um a cylindrical
assets in principle the same like a

66
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,179
cable you have in the inside of
conductive area and to have on the

67
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:39,960
outside a conductive area exactly like
in case of the coaxial cable so let's

68
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:47,969
come to the electrical signal um
research of the interface of biologic

69
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:55,530
itself and electronics and they are
often use devices which are called

70
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,289
microelectrode arrays and such

71
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:03,870
Mia's devices containing my plates and
shanks through which I'm cellular

72
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,780
signals are obtained and delivered

73
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:12,809
so the obtained and delivered is
important here because you can it can

74
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:19,080
use some such a media in both directions
and this means you can wreak record

75
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:28,590
electrical signals and you can also
still relate your biological system and

76
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,319
towers near produced so in principle
it's a

77
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,229
stand clear room technology which means
you take a four-inch borosilicate away

78
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:45,290
for which is actually just a glass way
from and um structure it by understand

79
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:52,640
that total is Sophie you use a double
layout resist to define the electrode

80
00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:00,290
area and the field lines and introduces
metastatic of for example titanium

81
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:08,510
platinum chromium arting God chromium by
electrode beam and in the end of course

82
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:14,660
you need a kind of ice relation of your
device and so-called passivation and

83
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:21,890
here and you often use a stack of
silicon oxide and silicon nitride or

84
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:30,110
alternatively emporia I my players in
the end the media or the electrode area

85
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:38,780
of the media is opened by reactive ion
etching to give you an example how such

86
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,760
a device is used

87
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:48,170
um for example you can can take such a
trip and take some sets on it

88
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:53,630
the chip with the cells goes into a
preamplifier the preamplifier is

89
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,900
connected in the end to main amplifier

90
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:03,680
this means that your cell signal which
acquired small it needs to be amplified

91
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,910
in parallel you can also perform some
other exam nation on a system for

92
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:16,520
example some kind of microscopic make
some nations like i showed you before

93
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,800
the cats you managing and in the end you
can do your recording and your

94
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,050
simulation experiments

95
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:32,449
let's come now to the coupling for the
coupling of the church were electrode

96
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,920
surface and there are some important
parameters for example the electrode in

97
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,939
please

98
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,370
the ceiling resistant as well as

99
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:50,880
I'm cell adhesion which is kind of
related to the ceiling resistance and

100
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:57,480
first the electrode and pins the
impedance is the concept of resistance

101
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:04,620
for AC circuits of this means it
contains also information about the

102
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:10,350
magnitude and the phase difference
between the voltage and currents and

103
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:17,520
current response and if we take a look
at the farm last mm you can see that the

104
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,040
impedance is defined over changing
voltage signal and the changing current

105
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,020
signal and if you perform some kind of
mathematic magic in the end you can see

106
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:34,620
that the capacitive part of the
impedance the capacitive impedance is

107
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:43,290
defined over the capacity of course and
the capacity again is defined over the

108
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:50,760
electrode area this is the important
part here which means in the end lon

109
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,610
pins electrodes supporter high
signal-to-noise ratio and they are

110
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:01,560
indicator for a good of signal
transmission in recording applications

111
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:08,010
and alone penes is also been official
for the charge-transfer cup capabilities

112
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:15,150
and says the relation and in the end as
you can also see in the image at the top

113
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:25,380
and we want to have electrodes with a
high electrode area or roughness so

114
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:32,339
mmm next we come to the ceiling
resistance in the image you can see the

115
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:39,180
equivalent circuit of the cell which is
sitting on an electrode and a in

116
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,489
principle a large gap between selling
electrode causes low junction resistance

117
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:50,579
and therefore large leakage currents
that means if you have a large gap

118
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:51,989
between the cell and

119
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:59,580
electrode uke and lose a certain amount
of your signals in the extracellular a

120
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:09,750
medium so in principle you want to have
your himself sitting tightly on the

121
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,770
electrode as you can see in the image on
the right side

122
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:26,760
this leads us to the occasion of sets so
um in principle in the cell membrane on

123
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:33,689
there are proteins responsible for the
specific Rick ignition of the surface of

124
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:40,709
another so and the coupling between them
two sets are between a cell and the

125
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:49,619
surface stand by hydrogen and sod riches
to shortly explain the occasion process

126
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,149
the first contact between the cell and
the surface

127
00:13:54,149 --> 00:14:00,959
Stan just statistically by brownie
emotion and then adhesion domains are

128
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,979
formed and in the end we receptors in
the server membrane coupled to the

129
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:17,880
inside of the cell to step lies the
whole system the adhesion ourselves to

130
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:26,339
the surface is comparable to the water
credibility of the surface so in the end

131
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:34,290
for our electrodes we want to have water
friendly electrode surfaces of course

132
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:39,630
they are also some improvement and
strategies for electrodes as you can see

133
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:46,709
there are some kind of neuro cages and
CMT microelectrodes and why is so in

134
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:54,869
principle they are also some kind of 3
3d structures which are inserted in the

135
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:00,630
electrode surface and again if we come
back to the bunker

136
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:06,720
positive part of the pins if you
introduce the structure on the surface

137
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,750
of the electrode ue increase the
electrode area and therefore decrease

138
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:21,420
the impedance so in the second part of
my talk I want to talk shortly about

139
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,579
some implants

140
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:31,380
first we see here the cochlear implant
which contains in principle microphone

141
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:40,920
speech processor and a track and measure
on the outside of asgard the basic

142
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:49,920
function is that the microphone is a
trance fairing and auditory signal in a

143
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:58,170
electrical signal and the electrical
signal is then by the speech processor

144
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:04,829
trans ferred interesting relation signal
for the copy out the steamy relationship

145
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:15,180
nuh is transferred from the transmitter
to the receiver in the inside of this

146
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:27,300
card and then is used to stimulate the
copy cochlea by the system relation

147
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:35,069
electrode so on the right side you can
see in example of the device and view

148
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:44,100
implantation of the electrode in this
club to produce the stimulation signal

149
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:50,430
from the auditory signal paths again
some mathematical procedures are used

150
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:55,530
like the amplitude more modulation
frequency and the composition and

151
00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:04,589
spectra analysis in the image in the
center you can see the stimulation

152
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:09,290
electrodes or the curvature of the
stimulation electrodes and

153
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:16,069
this is actually he done to sample the
curvature of the cochlea which is

154
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:23,359
different from various which are
responsible for different frequencies

155
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:29,360
and so on us to meet relation electrode
you have different from various which

156
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:36,379
you can use to stimulate different areas
in the cochlea and am also for this

157
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:43,220
implant it's important that reducing the
electrode nerve distance and decreases

158
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:49,010
the power consumption and the
interaction between the electrode areas

159
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:59,300
which means between the channels so a
rating implant is in principle of the

160
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:05,690
same concept you I inserting a
stimulation electrodes in Leyte not the

161
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:12,500
stimulation electrode contains and of
photo diode ship which means there's a

162
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,100
chip which is I'm sensitive to light

163
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:22,730
if light falls on the chipper electrical
signals produced and the electrical

164
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:31,520
signal is used to simulate again we
respect of neurons the problem in case

165
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:40,730
of the rating implant is that you have
on your stimulation electrode limited

166
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:48,710
space which means in the end also the
res solution for the original implant is

167
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:59,240
limited as you can see in the image on
the left in the end shortly about the

168
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,190
deep brain stimulation the deep brain
stimulation is a strategy to treat

169
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:13,700
symptoms for example of the packet zones
disease like TMR or slot movement and so

170
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,580
on and

171
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:23,299
again you are inserting here stimulation
electrodes in the brain targeting the

172
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:34,610
areas of the brain which are responsible
for the packets on symptoms and on the

173
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:41,809
right side you can see again the
stimulation electrodes and and example

174
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:49,668
device so in principle the student
relation prices which you are using

175
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:55,340
interfere and block the electrical
signals in the brain which are

176
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:03,080
responsible for the symptoms in the end
i would also like to give you a feeling

177
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,600
about the numbers you are using here so
in principle the applied charge

178
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,418
densities are always dependent on the
application which means on the implant

179
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:22,130
on set type and of course also on this
basis but employee example in case of

180
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:28,309
the deep brain stimulation the applied
voltages are quite high

181
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:37,130
I'm like nine boats and this is actually
interesting because the human body

182
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:44,059
always and contains also water and some
kind of electrical light inside and

183
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:53,178
outside ourselves and if you reach a
certain amplitude in Voight's you can

184
00:20:53,179 --> 00:21:03,590
can cause electrolyzers of hydrogen in a
body and this is actually not so nice if

185
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:11,418
it happens in the brain so here again is
the need to improve the relationship

186
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:17,929
contact for Lois to me relation
amplitudes and of course for less tissue

187
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:24,409
damage with that I would like to give
you some literature if you are

188
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,680
interested in the topic and

189
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,680
like to thank you for your attention

190
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,770
I thank you well this was amazing

191
00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:00,629
ah i have a question about a
phenomenological response and how this

192
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:06,180
is managed when you have such an implant
because i know that other kinds of

193
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:12,840
implants like pacemakers always come
with some medication which do require

194
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:21,000
lowering dramatic immunological response
how does it work when you have a retinal

195
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:30,540
implant and also and principal um I'm
not sure about the topic exactly but I

196
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:35,850
know that an important question of
course is that you always use materials

197
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:44,159
which are self friendly so um as I have
showed at the beginning in case of a

198
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:52,200
microelectrode areas which are quite of
news in basic research you using

199
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:59,910
electrode materials of which you know
that your selves like it and I'm also

200
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:07,740
for the installation for the passivation
you are usually use material which is

201
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:17,940
also at like biology friendly so and
what would be the what what are the

202
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,250
measures they can for not interfering
with the surrounding tissues are there

203
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:30,330
any special procedures they can you
isolate the iron from the surrounding

204
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:40,139
share this the plus ability that you can
get some some kind of scar tissue around

205
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,799
your electrodes and

206
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:49,690
if that happens again to sorry again you
need to increase your student relation

207
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:54,879
amplitudes to see success thank you

208
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:02,290
any more questions

209
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,179
thank you very much
