1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:20,500
yeah

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,960
microphone here okay hi everybody hi

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,070
I ok so mad I am

4
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,440
let's start with a small introduction
although I am i doing the heavy lifting

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,470
here and it is thought but I a small
advertisement i will also be giving a

6
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,420
talk about that the DDoS attacks are on
sunday so you're all invited

7
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,680
and even if you have other people not in
the room you can invite them as well

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,920
will be demonstrating DDoS attacks and
such so let's just the small

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,329
introduction about us

10
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:06,930
my name is Ben my career or what I did
over the years was mainly two things at

11
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,240
penetration testing offensive security
up to head of offensive security for air

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,940
for air one of the big companies in
Israel doing penetration testing and

13
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,460
development from writing code to a CEO
and vp our India for cyber security

14
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,270
startup so that's a that's what I like
to do and what I do and that currently i

15
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,340
work for impairment capsule on we deal
with the dos attacks and we deal with

16
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,220
the web attacks the traditional ones
like sequel injection process scripting

17
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,369
etc etc and the more sophisticated
automated attacks and I manage the

18
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:53,610
security research in in capsule which is
that tons of fun because well because it

19
00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:00,329
sounds fun and there's also where my
social there my contact information and

20
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:06,750
always answer so that's about me and
this is the FEMA and one of our a

21
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,869
brilliant their researchers and is the

22
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:18,480
well he's into machine learning it into
a any and combination between the

23
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,579
computer sciences and that the actual a
hedge actual world and is a security

24
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:33,690
researcher in in our team and before it
he start i would just like to mention

25
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:41,430
that the team i was quite sick is still
quite sick he had the fever is on 39

26
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,510
degrees i had to eventually carry into
the airplane is on tons of drugs

27
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:54,359
so-and-so isn't of drugs yeah it's
coming so if he's talking about that

28
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,130
being elephants or something just just
that you know play with it and you know

29
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,299
imagine that he's talking about headless
browsers so Emma please

30
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:10,050
oh I oh ok sorry i forgot to have a
another slide and remember that they're

31
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,510
about them that their demonstrations and
about that anything dad

32
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:22,140
the more i might say and what happens
here stays here it's a like a disclaimer

33
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,179
what we say is what we say not what
they're impairments they're saying okay

34
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,180
so

35
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:44,310
and so Google's most famous a webpage in
the world and let's start and they leave

36
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,840
the presentation go to really web
browser and understand how does it works

37
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:57,359
so if you have this very minimalistic a
webpage so if we open the source will

38
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:03,510
find a lot a lot a lot of code
completely understandable even their web

39
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,149
developers any time to understand what's
going on inside this code but the

40
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,010
someway browser will take this code and
converted to very simple minimalistic

41
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:20,250
and nice to our eyes webpage so let's
understand how it happens what happened

42
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:27,060
the behind behind it and how it
connected the two a headless problems so

43
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,669
first of all how browser can be headless
in one hand we have a code that we need

44
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:36,210
to represent to humans and another hand

45
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,549
its head was it can present nothing to
human so according to wikipedia headless

46
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,409
browser is browser without graphic user
interface classic tellers and attacks

47
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:51,930
web pages but doesn't present in the
human and it passed the result to the

48
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:58,650
other programs so let's start to
understand how does it work if i take

49
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:06,239
this line and a place on the left side
common line tools like cw6 URL or double

50
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,830
get a actually you can type a any URL
and grab the content of the URL but the

51
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,300
content is just a string

52
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,639
ok as one we saw before in their new
sauce you can nothing to do is it's

53
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:27,419
doing everything you need some thought
somehow to produce on the other side we

54
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:33,330
have browsers they can take this piece
of string in HTML or JavaScript and

55
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,550
converted to

56
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:42,080
read something visual something that we
as human we can understand it so very

57
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,030
very close to common line tools we have
different the h-2b libraries like item

58
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,650
your library go

59
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,870
java there are so actually they can
manipulate with this string you can grab

60
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:00,110
it from the web and find some content
inside but also it's very very far from

61
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:06,860
a web browser so what we have in this
gap is headless browsers there exactly

62
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,440
as normal browsers except one thing they
don't present the result is a human so

63
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:18,620
if we cross between them that understand
what is the difference the difference is

64
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,640
trippin

65
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:26,300
sorry supporting for standards like CSS
or JavaScript or html5 that the other

66
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:32,750
tools they don't have there is no
javascript no down no styling no layout

67
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,170
so if you grab and you know there is
some image you don't know it's left

68
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,530
corner of the screen all right corner of
the screen you just know there is some

69
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,219
image button browser you know where it's
placed in your screen

70
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,080
so what make this difference the
difference

71
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,780
exactly come from web browser engine
each of one of popular browsers they

72
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,010
have the engine like opera based on
pressed of the old versions of over

73
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:05,420
isn't explore and edge based on trade
and firefox from gecko safari based on

74
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:11,300
webkit and playing its focal WebKit that
from new versions diversity of opera

75
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:19,280
based on also android its integrated
inside versions of hundred so this makes

76
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,349
the difference between online tools

77
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:29,060
HTTP libraries and real browsers you
know what is don't document object model

78
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,030
not so lets you will help is HTML your
right is done

79
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:43,859
no it's not a dog it's just the HTML
rides used by browser to convert to dump

80
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:53,340
is view source we have seen before is
done not also it's exactly as HTML you

81
00:07:53,340 --> 00:08:02,880
right before just before browser reduce
it is called in devtools done correctly

82
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:10,560
it's a dom it's a human representation
of the object it's a similar to a HTML

83
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,490
tags so if we open death toll in chrome
or firefox so your browser you like you

84
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:23,520
you see that they you can see the object
exactly like in HTML and if you change

85
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,979
something in the page you see how the
don't change as well so let's see some

86
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:36,090
example what is domin how different from
a HTML so if we have a some the object

87
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:41,729
container and there is nothing inside
but we have a JavaScript that plays

88
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:47,970
content inside this container so if we
grab the source code we get this one and

89
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:53,580
actually we need to produce and
interpret this script to understand that

90
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:59,730
hello world should be placed inside
container but if we take a look and um

91
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:07,230
representation site from death toll will
see this line actually from execute this

92
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,700
code inside the web engine and
represented on after the Constitution so

93
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:19,890
hello world contains inside the
container a object so except the dogs

94
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:25,620
there is also other things that the web
engine supports javascript as we have

95
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,490
seen before

96
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:32,430
scottsdale street SVG vector images
Martha Nell language to present the

97
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,290
mathematical functions and operators
WebGL graphic engine and many many more

98
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:44,910
so on all these under standards in a
doubletree see so if you want to check

99
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:51,930
what our browser support we can use test
like modernizer it's little things test

100
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,520
for checking out our broad support you
can see there is green and red lines for

101
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:02,430
green for support and read for
unsupported let's zoom in for example

102
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:08,040
this is a real example from home support
SVG before but it does not support the

103
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,349
daytime function in JavaScript actually
dysfunction implemented also in firefox

104
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:19,500
but not supported in from so we can test
what engine support and what and our

105
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:26,790
engine does not support and if we take
any HTTP library or ctrl it support

106
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,819
nothing because can generate there and
understand what is SVG for example or

107
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:40,680
hollister another test is extract as he
seeks to actually this test the check

108
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,530
create javascript engine and as you can
see not all browsers can pass all the

109
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:50,520
tests those some differences between
javascript engines and for example

110
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:56,610
phantoms is one of the heavens browsers
are going to talk about so it has less

111
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:03,360
failed test than firefox version 31
again common line tools they can't

112
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,350
execute jobs

113
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:11,050
so let's see some examples of those
browsers in the wild the most popular

114
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,849
discontent yes

115
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,060
so if you use the function GS or hear
about it

116
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:23,500
only 23 people ok it's based on webkit
its cross-platform that's very nice

117
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,180
exportable script with javascript so if
you know javascript is very easy to

118
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,180
write escape forefront and it's very
useful for a UI automation simulated

119
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:41,829
user experience some fourths of hunting
gs's is leaner based on gecko the engine

120
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:47,710
a firefox engine and triple G is based
on presentation using internet explorer

121
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:54,730
other type of a headless browsers is it
was browsers day we can compile inside

122
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,430
our application or use a model in our
application one of the biggest examples

123
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:07,270
of some you it's basically from chromium
way engine and it has inside the a

124
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:14,860
javascript engine developed by google it
probably with the outlet and c plus

125
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:20,080
classes also maybe if you like your
basic it compiled the cross-platform

126
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,000
application or can use this as a model
inside your application you can

127
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,950
dynamically load it different examples
of where those browsers and also means

128
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:40,720
for my betters framework or web . net
what is not headless browser so

129
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:50,170
selenium is not headless browser chili
selenium is manipulation to ok bedroom

130
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:57,160
it use his webdriver and if you need to
have real browser installed in your

131
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,660
system . start use selenium because then
you need to communicate with real

132
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:07,180
browser and send him Senate commons to
execute and run and go to the page or

133
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,310
press the button Sosa you did not is not
headless browser it's also manipulation

134
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,069
to there's also different examples of

135
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:21,310
for manipulation tools like Casper GS or
up you used to mobile web driver or

136
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:30,729
capybara and more examples 30 dive a in
the headless browser need to understand

137
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,530
very very important thing I call it the
world of two contexts actually when you

138
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:40,270
work with headless browser there's two
contexts that the you need to understand

139
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:46,090
and separate between them one context is
browser context means that when you want

140
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:51,520
you have access to osu access to file
system and if you want to read the file

141
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,650
you are in browser context but if you go
to the webpage you move to another

142
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:02,470
context and this context you have access
to them the only language you can use is

143
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,570
JavaScript and this context evaluated
not inside the browser but inside the

144
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,700
web engine so all the time

145
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,420
there's ping pong between two contexts
this and let's see some simple example

146
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,290
the syntax is here for fun GS

147
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,319
so if you want to open page

148
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:27,190
example.com you write a comment and
browser context and common to WebKit

149
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:33,280
engine control common to open this page
so now when the these comments against

150
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,449
acute we have reference to the page
later we want to grab a title of this

151
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:43,300
page so the title exist only page
content there is no idea in browser what

152
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,979
is title exist in page content inside
website engine so what we need to do we

153
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:54,190
need to type age value because we want
to evaluate some code inside the WebKit

154
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:59,590
and pass this code injected inside
WebKit engine so we wrapped it will

155
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:05,860
execute this code and return this call
back the results to our browser content

156
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,860
so all the time there is a ping-pong
between two contexts

157
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:19,620
ok so and so can you continue that
effort so am I so hope

158
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,670
ok so until now we've talked about the
theoretical part of everything behind

159
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:30,540
the headless browsers so it sounds like
a useful thing right and only two or

160
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,890
three people that they're using a
phantom vs for example what do you think

161
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:42,630
our use cases for a headless browser for
headless browsers did you hear the rest

162
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,410
of it

163
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,870
yes javascript with friends

164
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,870
ok which is called from the robbery
itself

165
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,350
the JavaScript just kept

166
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:03,100
ok right and more use cases unit testing

167
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,830
ok good more i need at least 15 ok

168
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,540
stripers scrapers okay great

169
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:20,439
yes taking screenshots that's great

170
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:31,990
ok so we are down to the last 11 come on
a authentication with proxy okay okay

171
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,750
yeah

172
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:40,520
yes yes

173
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:49,220
i I couldn't hear what is interesting
okay right so well I I kind of combine

174
00:16:49,220 --> 00:17:05,569
the the unit testing and the end-to-end
in there 10 and 11 my book . yes they're

175
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:07,189
the algorithm

176
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:13,820
okay okay or you can use it to click on
ads in order to get money which is yes

177
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:22,429
but who needs money right Evan money is
over and over and valued ok so I so

178
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:27,230
we're right so let's let's start with
some of the use cases we talked about

179
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:32,030
and that I conveniently I wrote them
down in the next slide but let's talk

180
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:36,320
about some of them so first of all we
mentioned unit testing and/or end-to-end

181
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,990
testing so if we have a sophisticated
the a web application that we want to

182
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,400
test and we want to make sure that when
we introduce new features we don't break

183
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,370
everything else or anything else and
that we want to check that they eat

184
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:57,860
so-called internet whether did not is
not they're ruining anything if we have

185
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:03,800
a web application that does things from
different locations for example so cute

186
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,320
i would be a good good place because we
can actually do dynamic things on the

187
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,200
owner web application and other use
cases can be a taking screenshots for

188
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,150
example search engines and they can show
that this is a screenshot of the

189
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,050
homepage of the page that you're about
to visit so you can you know where

190
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:30,620
you're going and other are the things
like crawling currently the modern a

191
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,700
start engines are doing that they're
using a part of their colors are using

192
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,930
headless browsers in order to get to
dynamic content so they can also index

193
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:46,260
the dynamic content which is cool and
and then then again and we have some

194
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:54,570
more a use cases and like a performance
monitoring and such but we also have the

195
00:18:54,570 --> 00:19:00,540
more interesting use cases we mentioned
creating so scraping you're all familiar

196
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,000
with the term I yes

197
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,070
ok so let's explain if we're all
familiar it's a basically taking content

198
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,960
from the web pages for example if I have
an e-commerce website i would like to

199
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,810
see what my competition is doing i will
take all their product plus prices and i

200
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:24,480
will check that there and that I'm the
cheapest or whatever I want to do with

201
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,180
that information and so taking a content
from my website is good because you can

202
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,650
take dynamic content you can take a
Content that maybe the site is checking

203
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:40,620
if it's a if it's a JavaScript supported
a client and only then it their displays

204
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:46,620
the data many many different things that
are there to be done and there's also a

205
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:52,350
lot of ecommerce manipulations like
sniping meaning get that you want to

206
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,480
out-beat everybody else on auctions so
you want to complete a process now this

207
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,250
process may not be as simple as a
posting some information to a webpage

208
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:08,970
you might need to go through certain
stages so so we're sniping is also a

209
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,380
good thing we mentioned the
advertisement

210
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,750
there's a lot of money in advertisement
and the and click fraud meaning that if

211
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:25,380
i have a website and advertisers are
paying me so thats real users will click

212
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,990
on the

213
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:32,540
Annoying banner ads as in and then my
headless browser will do that for them

214
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:38,450
it will emulate browsing through the
website five pages and then click on the

215
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:44,600
advertisement to make me some money and
there's also DDoS attacks and

216
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:50,600
sophisticated the latest attacks that
complete that process and that is a

217
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,590
harder to it takes more resources is
also a

218
00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:01,020
and.and well I wouldn't call it the fun
thing to do I working against us but

219
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:06,299
that it would be a possibility for a
headless browser during of course

220
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:13,260
pausing of any other thing checking what
they what might go wrong is also it's

221
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:19,350
also a use case and of course we all
have our imagination and the project

222
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:26,699
that were involved in so i think that
the we cannot find more use cases so i

223
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:34,320
think that lets go to some demos so
let's leave the celery and the side and

224
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,950
dive inside the the demos very simple
demo as mentioned before a capture

225
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,909
screen

226
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:47,190
ok if you want to capture the screen to
the image with function GS most of the

227
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:53,130
examples here based in front of us
because its most popular and very easy

228
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:59,940
just five lines of code you go to the
website grab it and place the image so

229
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,940
let's see it happened

230
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:12,620
ok so what I'm going to do quantum
Cheers

231
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,120
capture image

232
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,590
come

233
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:29,699
and let's open our folder and wait for
the result of this one

234
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,820
ok so can you see

235
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,010
yeah

236
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:48,480
so we have the image of the webpage but
cool it's very simple but more

237
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,770
interesting if you want to grab the
image of the webpage that doesn't fit

238
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:58,080
inside the screen so we need to scroll
down to see all the image from jazz do

239
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:07,020
that for us so let's go to github that
come for example this one we could close

240
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:14,340
so if we go to give up we can see that
page we need to scroll to see all the

241
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:23,070
content but when we grab it we spawned
from jess is very easy and you have all

242
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:27,960
the page in one image so if you want to
mail it to send it very very easy

243
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,990
belkin generated site PDF so i really
like it so you need to send any report

244
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,990
place in PDF and somebody

245
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:48,580
was the presentation of this actually
this is the code of grabbing a one exit

246
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:56,860
42 grab the image can see it's very very
simple just couple lines of code and go

247
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:02,169
to their URL said the size of the screen
we want to capture and save it as it has

248
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:07,660
an image so let's come back to
presentation

249
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:12,880
ok so image good but most of the time we
have nothing to do with the image we

250
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,250
need more data so we have different
options in there in front on my GS we

251
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:24,910
can grab titles or different a objects
inside the page very easy we can grab

252
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:29,230
the content like view source we have
seen before and more interesting we can

253
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:36,460
get only text presented to the user out
without HTML talks so we can they just

254
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:42,490
grabbed only the text and we don't need
to filter it or more than more than that

255
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:49,090
if you want to catch our layouts and
fear more prompt messages or handle a

256
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:54,040
different council event we also can do
it with just simple hook we write on

257
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:59,320
console message and what to do like
print and our passage from their

258
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,570
pagecontext to the browser context and
printing their browser conflict

259
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:13,990
ok for example let's grab the content
from google.com sure text them up

260
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,940
yeah

261
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,890
so I wait a second to grab it

262
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,470
yeah

263
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,850
stuck

264
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,850
ok

265
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,429
fine then

266
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:49,429
so again

267
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,440
ok now it's more so what we can see I
just print there the content of the page

268
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,970
inside inside the the console so you can
see Google screen reader user gmail

269
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:07,660
image signing this is exactly what user
can read on the page so is just one line

270
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:13,630
of course they can grab all the content
result in HTML tug very nice and useful

271
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,940
ok let's come back to the presentation

272
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:29,429
all this nice but what with we can do it
exactly without and the engine

273
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:34,860
okay except the image but if you want to
simulate a user behavior actually what

274
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:41,550
we need to do is to click on the bottom
buttons feel forms or do some actions on

275
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,510
the page so i'll continue this google
example because I like it

276
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:53,220
yes very nice very simple aui so it's
very easy to work with it

277
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,260
ok so let's assume that Google don't
have api you can't write / q equals and

278
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:03,120
your question and you need to type the
query inside the field and press google

279
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,820
search so what we can do actually we
just need to know their the button and

280
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:14,520
if the field its name the idea of the
name and find it inside their webpage

281
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:20,820
inside the dome object and just do the
manipulation or a president or feel it

282
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:27,570
or whatever so let's see the names of it
we can use a dev tool and look inside

283
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:35,340
the Dom so we can see that the name of
the button is I its IDs LST meals a day

284
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,689
I be and let find the google search
button

285
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,140
ok it has named button k

286
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:50,340
ok so what we are going to do is place
it inside our phantom GS javascript code

287
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:55,379
that we going we're going to execute so
very simple they are going to pass the

288
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,830
code to a webpage context

289
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:05,129
ok inside page evaluate as i mentioned
before we find the object 1 by D lstm

290
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:09,270
ciebie and place the value function GS
we are going to social function GS and

291
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,030
press the barky very simple

292
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:19,200
okay so we just write exactly the things
that user will do when it

293
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,220
browse this webpage so let's execute and
see what happened

294
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,330
yeah

295
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:37,600
ok the result will be saved as the image
so we can shortly see the pier on the

296
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,000
screen

297
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,059
probably there was some internet
connection problems

298
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,690
another one

299
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:06,360
that was not not no connection is it is
the world i hope you believe me i can

300
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:17,520
show you later but for some reason the
Phantom just don't want to work ok the

301
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,809
code is available so you can check it by
yourself it's working it's not five

302
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:24,899
minutes ago

303
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,900
a ok so let's come presentation

304
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:44,779
so ajax know what is Ajax other people
ok so probably if you don't know Jax is

305
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:50,299
there a ass Antonio said java the
question responses for example for it

306
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:53,360
when you go to your facebook and you
scroll down your page doesn't refresh

307
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,949
you can see more and more and more
content your page without the first so

308
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:03,889
there's some magics question spawns
behind it so this is something that you

309
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:13,699
can't do with just simple common line
tour or enroll or a any HTTP library so

310
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:18,889
you need to communicate all the time is
a back-end server ping-pong just grab

311
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:28,879
the data and and show it so i hope now
this is time to work let's see okay I

312
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:33,980
prepared some example let's say I want
to fly from Tel Aviv where I came from

313
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:40,730
to build rod and I want to search for
some tickets and prices so when i press

314
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,309
for search

315
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:49,639
ok you can see the page it's take time
to load the data and assorted because

316
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:56,209
all the time the webpage communicate
with back-end server and the data is is

317
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,950
not exist inside HTML

318
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:02,570
ok it's come also only with objects
request to back-end server so if you

319
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:08,090
want to grab the information will not
find it inside the air the source but if

320
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:16,309
we use a phantom or any headless browser
so we can grab these data let's let's

321
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:21,559
look at the example I I just about the
example to grab the price you can see a

322
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:32,090
result price airline and a the name of a
killer to buy the ticket so cross your

323
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,279
fingers and hope work now

324
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:39,169
yeah

325
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:47,130
no signs of life ok

326
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:54,179
actually when you work with projects
take some time to grab the page because

327
00:31:54,179 --> 00:32:00,030
quantum Jesse to it fill all the data
are grab our come to the page if

328
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,530
pre-orders start to grab below the
address

329
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,220
what can be better

330
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,140
second

331
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,640
let's check the address

332
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,590
another one tried

333
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,889
yeah

334
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,890
ok

335
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,340
there's some connection issues with
phantom and the web

336
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:50,970
ok not some problems

337
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:02,470
ok I'll not try to fix it now and to
understand what happen all i can do is

338
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,590
just reach the the another internet
connection to check it

339
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,080
no it's okay

340
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,750
the data before know now that there is
no problem is that it can access the web

341
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,600
page so there was someway internet
issues

342
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:30,030
ok this example is local so there is no
problem problem

343
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:39,000
do anyone have an idea what I'm going to
talk about at this this example find the

344
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,680
difference is exactly sometimes a
different website they don't place

345
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,810
content as text so you can grab the text
and compare if it's change like price

346
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:55,560
for a some some stuff okay what you need
to do it's just compare images so as I

347
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:01,830
mentioned before a quantum GIS can be
manipulated by Casper GS and you can

348
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:06,810
combine different script to compare
images and can it can be done very very

349
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:11,340
easily so let's see another example

350
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:18,840
so this example is want to buy a coffee
for example and depressed we have price

351
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,490
this there's no image that some
connection issues

352
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:29,340
ok so we have a price for two dollars
but this price

353
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,710
exactly if you can see its image it's
not attacks so you can grab it and we

354
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:39,240
are going to change the price without
changing the HTML just by changing the

355
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,500
image which

356
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:47,349
yeah

357
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,520
yeah

358
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:02,970
ok so now the price is one dollar
without any changes in HTML so if you

359
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:10,230
grab HTML and you'll find nothing but
you need to compare the images so we can

360
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:23,100
execute a phantom CSS script to compare
the images and it will for us so first a

361
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:28,589
execution it just create a the baseline
we want to compare so let's execute the

362
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,590
first time

363
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:43,990
ok so now we have a baseline we go and
see the images it's grab ok there is a

364
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,569
price the image of the coffee

365
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:53,829
ok so let's change the price back to two
dollars sort

366
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:08,720
ok so now our price change the two
dollars and let try to grab it with

367
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,720
frontal

368
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,910
ok

369
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:30,390
so we have some failed test means there
are some differences so as you can see

370
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:34,920
let's go out to the screenshot to
failures and find the differences we can

371
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,930
see the image changed so we know there
was some changes visual changes side the

372
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:48,149
page also more zoomed versions change
exactly in the price so just can't

373
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,530
imagine what you can do with this
technique to take two websites and

374
00:36:52,530 --> 00:37:00,780
compare the differences it's also useful
by a UI a QA 4qn for web to a to check

375
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:06,869
their CSS if you change some image it's
changed in fay some picture move one or

376
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:13,109
two pixels left or right so visually
can't understand it you can see but with

377
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:22,410
algorithms to compare images very very
easy to find this change so i mentioned

378
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:29,220
before a awesome and other tool that you
use to compile inside the application

379
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:35,730
not like phantom that you passed some
script and to the to the engine and it's

380
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:41,309
generate it's actually interpret it
inside or sodium is a library you can

381
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:47,369
load inside your application and you can
do more interesting thing when you do it

382
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:55,980
so there are some may example of God the
written in a awesome the idea saying you

383
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,960
have to context that your web browser
your application context and you have an

384
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,279
engine context

385
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:10,799
ok in case of insomnia is a chrome base
from based its link inside so just try

386
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:15,869
to imagine if you have in one side
browser call and in other hand you have

387
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:24,750
to like a dotnet and with forms and and
all the UI and all the buttons you can

388
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:29,730
create you just can take your headless
browser and give him a head actually

389
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:35,880
create had actually real browser on top
of headless browser so I'm going to

390
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,900
show the example of browser based on
awesome engine you can see it's real

391
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:49,109
browser it's written completely on.net
using awesome engine and you can browse

392
00:38:49,109 --> 00:39:05,519
to any website you want and just so so
you can help those browsers and make

393
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,359
real browser your browser if you want to
use the inside application so you don't

394
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,519
need to switch to chrome or any other
browser used by user you can integrated

395
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:20,339
inside your application so it's very
very useful and very nice actually it's

396
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:25,680
not mandatory to a create you i also can
you also can use it as a header

397
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,960
completely headless browser is common
line and executed on headless system

398
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:45,140
last but not least a android and there's
no real example because they re how to

399
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:54,170
project android screen name the
projector but what's interesting inside

400
00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:00,410
android it it has a web view inside the
operating system so you can use it

401
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:06,560
exactly like in a headlock his headless
browser so you can create web you give

402
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,750
them my screen size of 0 and then just
manipulate the JavaScript inside the

403
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:19,160
review engine to do whatever you want to
side the mobile what is a group with

404
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:24,440
review its integrated inside hundred so
you don't need to worry about to install

405
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:32,210
it is an Android or how to deliver this
say a this model inside the system it's

406
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:41,390
already existed for all the time of day
today by a google so been right before i

407
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:49,460
wrap this up a must try running the
script maybe we'll if we all think

408
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:54,680
positive thoughts now maybe it will work
i don't know if i am an eyewitness and I

409
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:01,370
i saw that this they worked in the hotel
room so let's keep our fingers crossed

410
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,370
the crust

411
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:11,900
always felt about grad the october first
to number eight

412
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:22,430
ok ok thank you all for the public
sausage rolls that ok so now we have no

413
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:28,250
I'm and my cell you that that is these
prices are arrow well or not the prices

414
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:33,320
that we paid so I'm very happy about it
i think we paid like 294 per ticket but

415
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:39,260
it was a cheap flight anyway back to the
back to the topic so okay that engine

416
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:43,580
now well now you really believe that
these scripts more is there is a believe

417
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,470
you from the start don't worry

418
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:52,310
so just that wrapping up i will just a
share a few cities things where we see

419
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:58,460
headless browser so like I said what in
capsule of that part of what we do is to

420
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,720
protect the web applications of our
clients we have a CDN and the traffic

421
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,990
goes through the CDN and there we

422
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,109
look at the traffic and find out

423
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:14,030
fingerprint all types of things who's a
google chrome and who the google chrome

424
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:19,460
impersonate or who the Googlebot and is
a google but impersonator etc and so I

425
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,370
lately we've seen that

426
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:30,680
headless browsers being used in the wild
for some use cases something is SEO SEO

427
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,379
is very popular for attacks that these
days and we've seen sequel injection

428
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:43,340
attacks as it injects links into pages
so instead of using sequel injection for

429
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:49,490
the more traditional use cases like and
taking all the database or a and taking

430
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:56,299
any part of the database modifying gate
or a deleting within of attacks that

431
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:02,720
actually insert links to improve the
page rank of also websites we've seen

432
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:11,149
similar attempt with the historic excess
so the end we've also seen and sem SEO

433
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:16,070
tricks being used with headless browsers
to scrape content not from e-commerce

434
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:20,450
website the traditional again the
traditional scraping of content from

435
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:27,020
e-commerce websites or your your shop is
the cheapest but taking dynamic content

436
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:33,170
from pages then showing them on the ring
of other websites in order to improve

437
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:39,590
their SEO and get some ad revenue and
we've seen a lot of an e-commerce abused

438
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:46,340
a well mainly scraping like i said if i
have our website and someone knows all

439
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,340
my prices all the time and they can just
a

440
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:51,600
get it too

441
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:57,450
and Aiden are less than the than my
price then I'm losing a lot of business

442
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:04,350
but we've also seen some more a obscure
sings like we have clients who have

443
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:10,770
shopped with limited edition product and
then as our sniper bots that buys all

444
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:16,800
the limited edition product so that the
normal customers has no way it has less

445
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,560
value and we see that of course what
with ticketing website our clients at

446
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:29,130
the our buying the VIP tickets then sell
them for double the price it

447
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:36,180
let's say that it's very popular for any
site that offers concert tickets etc and

448
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:42,240
of course he just attacks with headless
browsers it's not nothing new it's a

449
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,240
it's happening for a few years now but
first of all we've seen an increase and

450
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:55,830
we also seen that larger mobile botnet
and lately that uses a headless browsers

451
00:44:55,830 --> 00:45:02,370
to do to generate a lot of expensive
traffic to some of our clients so that

452
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:11,100
that's the main scenarios that the we
see a in the wild and so I felt well I

453
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,210
was try this

454
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:21,210
valla bomb right yeah thank you and that
and again most of the same goes to

455
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:26,370
Deimos do the heavy lifting here of
doing the actual layer presentation and

456
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:32,190
they also like I said I dragged him sick
here and there and had to really

457
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:37,230
insisted he goes here even though that
is sick because I thought you would

458
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:44,780
enjoy this place and so thank you Dima
thank you

459
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:52,040
and now if you have any questions will
be happy and if you remember any other

460
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:57,560
questions you can we're here till sunday
and you can also wear contact us that

461
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:03,710
digitally but of course we're happy for
any questions right here as well as the

462
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:04,850
game

463
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:08,220
yes

464
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:16,080
a microphone you thought it would need
to have a microphone tested that you

465
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:16,650
want

466
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:20,700
alright thank you i thought it would be
neat if I had a very bad internet

467
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,660
connection and I wanted to use a site
that had lots of Ajax to have a headless

468
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,930
browser running somewhere else and then
it would send me pictures so I could

469
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:32,520
pretend it's on major excite and I'm
wondering if they're like out-of-the-box

470
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:38,490
systems for this I've been wondering
this for years and I never set one up so

471
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:42,810
you find to send your question correctly
you want to take picture like for once

472
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:49,590
how second to grab that how the process
say come from the south of the page

473
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:52,320
they'd like to receive all objects
information

474
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,070
yes and i want to receive it all in one
package to my computer over a pet

475
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:02,280
internet connection so that this other
side with lots of HX it gets it all in

476
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,210
the data center and I just have this
small link to the data center you can

477
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:10,260
grab the information using a phantom
just pre oh yeah yeah but have to write

478
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:15,990
it this one already for me like I had to
make a pretty interface and all the okay

479
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:21,959
in the break I can show you how to do it
though it's very easy and ok i might

480
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:28,770
have already written that much okay
we'll talk i get so high

481
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,150
just a quick two questions thank you for
some you my didn't know about the thing

482
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:40,619
i'm using factor for years so I phantom
vs awesome it's like 80 20 or what's the

483
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:41,730
use real life

484
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:49,080
what do you think I can base my answer
on top of a data we have seen the wild

485
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:54,119
ok as then capsule I that we have where
CDN so we we know what actually happened

486
00:47:54,119 --> 00:48:03,240
is already clients and it's it's around
the 50-54 usage but a or some used

487
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:09,180
mostly for a applications ok so if you
have we have we have customers that have

488
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:14,759
a game and you want to a create
application that have it has browser

489
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,950
inside the game so here's a Samuel so
it's friend of subhuman

490
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:25,890
there's no third stuff think that's
mainly used except except phantom you

491
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:31,109
have slimmer and the triple but it's
sports from way from Phantom haha and

492
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:35,400
they assume based on chromium so you
have different projects like chrome

493
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,579
embedded framework or web weapon . nets

494
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:43,020
ok one last question how do I leach
WebSockets you have anything from that

495
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:48,270
how I mean you're scraping you in that
business so i was wondering if you have

496
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:53,130
any insight from like recommendations
for stuff useful for actually grabbing

497
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:59,130
information from web sockets like socket
i/o and yeah now that I never checked

498
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:06,180
with option to use WebSocket right so
okay I also the interesting right

499
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:09,180
if you check it ok thanks

500
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:23,210
have you actually made the knee testing
with penetration testing with adams is

501
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:33,589
like testing extra payload maybe I did I
did I did the testing and in phantom

502
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:39,440
guess it was useful for ab for many
things but it will let me give you a

503
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,790
couple of things that it was that off
the top of my have the member of her

504
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:51,259
goldfish so i probably remember a little
but a first case was a race condition a

505
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:55,550
v-neck in a complicated process it
wasn't there the traditional race

506
00:49:55,550 --> 00:50:00,140
condition of sending lots of post
requests or fair get give me seven

507
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:05,328
hundred dollars and hoping that their
yeah i'll get 1400 always the only have

508
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:11,150
1000 in my account hope I made it clear
so it's more of a process that you need

509
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:18,589
to do and then by a by doing at the
complicated process together from many

510
00:50:18,589 --> 00:50:22,880
different sources you can you can they
get to do that and also some logical

511
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:29,420
bypasses and that well let's say you
might have done it as a rice but it

512
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:35,359
would take much more time so i think
that these are the two cases that i can

513
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:40,970
remember of using his brother for
penetration testing that was the fun and

514
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:47,509
it and I think that both of them brought
results that i'm not sure that in the

515
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:54,230
limited time I are you a penetration
tester is a copy or adjust is that ok so

516
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:57,230
when you do it at the profession

517
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:04,120
you have limited time because the client
always wants to pay and less so they

518
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:09,670
don't want to pay a lot of money so you
need to complete a certain that there is

519
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:15,340
a certain tests of an application within
a week or I within a few days depending

520
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:21,970
on the client so i'm not sure that these
results would have been there by time

521
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:29,560
otherwise so it made things very
convenient in there and fun also where

522
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:36,310
once a ok i remember i told you i have a
memory of a goldfish so deserting about

523
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:43,270
penetration testing with the air project
and involving a raffle and the screen

524
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:50,500
capture and comparing screenshots and
let's say that it did the trick and and

525
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,880
again there were no parameters passed or
something like that could help otherwise

526
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,910
I think that houses in that you can of
course do it in other ways like a alter

527
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:05,920
ego and then writing something but i
think that it was a I think it was a

528
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:13,480
good choice to do that with his brothers
ok hope that helped you think you don't

529
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:19,420
need and hello and on the top of this
question i would like to ask these

530
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:24,580
easier or more convenient or quicker
than for example using better shoot or

531
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:29,470
something like proxy and trying to do
the attacks

532
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:34,839
I mean the plantation fist so so again
again it depends

533
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:41,320
it all depends like the Veil the last
the last guy said it depends i would

534
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:48,460
well when I was a penetration tester and
even when i do what i do right now I you

535
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:53,770
have a toolset right you you have bear
you have the wireshark you have

536
00:52:55,010 --> 00:53:01,100
many other tools that you can use
economy runs for example some of them

537
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:06,890
these tools can do the same thing like
if I i can write a Python script to

538
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:12,920
father directories and I can use their
Buster two files directories i can use

539
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,420
bourbon i can use fiddler and I can use
up and I can use phantom dress and I can

540
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:22,880
use the a so medium and I could so you
have a toolset so first of all a lot of

541
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,070
it depends on what you're comfortable
with

542
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:32,720
so so that's part of it also has the
sideline i would like to say that what

543
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,100
you're comfortable with

544
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:38,360
sometimes I go the other way to find
something that I'm not comfortable with

545
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:44,960
so we we can explore additional
technologies so again it depends on the

546
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,470
toolset that you're comfortable with
that your is if you want to do

547
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:53,569
especially when you're taking time and
you need to do something quick and and

548
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:59,030
its really case in case a specific if
there's something that I can do with the

549
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:06,650
normal a Carol or i can just grab a page
grabbin HTML page run a red X or run a

550
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:11,690
search between or whatever and get the
results and I'm finished then maybe I

551
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:13,300
wouldn't bother

552
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:19,000
using condoms is although it would take
about the same time but it's simpler so

553
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:29,920
it's really case in case the defendant
actually ok cool so we're really good so

554
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,050
I see there's no further questions but
really feel free to contact us anytime

555
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:40,630
during the conference we were rude love
to help and
