1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:25,450
hello everybody welcome to the second
day of Vulcan 2k16 hope you're getting

2
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,880
having a great time

3
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,899
today's lectures this one will be about
idea of another Europe so our speaker

4
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:41,800
will be orient arion work that IBM in
the nineties as a IT architect since

5
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:49,780
2002 until 2 2010 he was consulting with
the several European countries about

6
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:56,679
their IT strategy and since 2006 helps
secure information with the systems of

7
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:03,100
national governments and NGOs so please
give more about come to audience enjoyed

8
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:11,410
good afternoon all it's only to certain
the afternoon everybody's already awake

9
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,130
so that's very cool thank you for being
here and thank you welcome for inviting

10
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:20,710
me i never been to Serbia before so up
to now which really been been great i

11
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,300
want to talk about four

12
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,440
I don't know 40 minutes or so I helped
about some of the work I've been doing

13
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,750
on the relationship between IT strategy
which is something I've been working on

14
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,360
for the last 50 years and IT security
which after Snowden of course turns out

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,550
to be a lot harder than we all feared it
would and recently I found a very large

16
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,720
corporation where I can actually say a
lot of this stuff out loud and not you

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,090
know get moved out of the door very
quickly so that's been very cool so most

18
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,600
of the slides are about to see most of
the things i will say I've actually been

19
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,520
talking to the chief information
officers and achieve security people are

20
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,810
very large European technology companies
as well and they are looking for experts

21
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,310
to basically help them with some of this
stuff so i'll be talking about that as

22
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,810
well i'm not going to do the basics of
IT security because i know that most

23
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,640
people here probably already have

24
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,019
know how to encrypt every male and
things like that but if you have

25
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,720
questions about that or if you're into
journalism you want to talk to me about

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,000
things like that and after the door come
up to me and we can have a discussion so

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,350
some of you may be old enough to
remember a time when you could get on an

28
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,310
airplane without being treated like a
criminal for 45 minutes I can certainly

29
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,640
remember the glory days of the nineteen
nineties when you could get on an

30
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,589
airplane with two titanium ice axis and
legally they would be walking stick so

31
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,940
that would be fine

32
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,000
nowadays of course you have to surrender
your toenail clippers

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,560
even if you are the pilots because of
security or something

34
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,220
so the world is going a little bit funny
over 15 years and hopefully at some

35
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,850
point in the future we can roll it back
to something resembling normalcy

36
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,310
I certainly would like to work to work
on that and in the meantime of course we

37
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,850
should all be legally allowed to encrypt
our emails and not be considered a

38
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:15,310
terrorist when we do so so all the
cybers have been of course in the news a

39
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,870
lot usually with images like these
because you know those evil cyber people

40
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:25,959
doing cyber things to our cyber systems
yada yadi so I try to avoid those kinds

41
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,620
of words whenever possible but sometimes
if you want to talk to administer you

42
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,980
have to use the c-word because otherwise
they don't understand

43
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,780
I'm so then you just sort of relent a
little bit the problem is of course with

44
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,799
most of the news about all the IT
security problems and privacy breaches

45
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,380
and including center systems nobody
talks about you know the elephant in the

46
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,019
room in corporate world and of course we
know certainly thanks Snowden but we

47
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:57,130
knew before that yeah everybody is
buying and using information technology

48
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:04,600
to do so so in two thousand we had a
reports to the European Parliament about

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,900
especially American digitized espionage
against European countries European

50
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,700
political institutions in European
corporations and july two thousand one

51
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,469
report actually detailed a lot of how
effective countermeasures against that

52
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,789
kind of industrial and political
espionage done by even then the NSA they

53
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:28,849
call it a Shalon then we call a
different orbits the same stuff and it

54
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:33,800
said look teach all the young people in
school how to do an encryption use only

55
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,219
open source encryption libraries and you
know it said all those really sensible

56
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:41,449
good things that are still really
sensible advice and that wasn't 2001

57
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:45,949
regrettably it wasn't july two thousand
one that the report was offered to the

58
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,249
european parliament's then of course in
August everybody on one wasn't all the

59
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:53,689
day and then we're going to discuss the
report in September of 2001 but then

60
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:56,539
something else happened and of course
then we were suddenly at war with

61
00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:00,619
Afghanistan for reasons that still are a
bit unclear but there were and so the

62
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:04,009
reports that have disappeared into a
deep Troyer and was never seen again

63
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:08,419
until mr. Snowden got on a plane to Hong
Kong with USB drive containing about a

64
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:13,789
million very interesting documents that
most of you will have seen by now so

65
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:18,259
some European Parliament's including the
Dutch funded I work with first with

66
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:22,459
several years have tried to implement
this policy some of these measures that

67
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:25,550
you know democratic government should be
running mostly open source software

68
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,319
because its law is executed by code and
that code should be public just like the

69
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,680
law it's not very difficult to
understand if you understand a little

70
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,849
bit about democracy

71
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:39,558
I'm but that has been blocked by massive
lobbying and of course in Snowden we now

72
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:43,819
probably know why America is so against
European governments running on

73
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:48,829
something else then an american-made
software so currently our governments

74
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:53,869
are most incompetent I don't think that
most of them are completely evil but

75
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:57,289
there's a lot of incompetents there and
yeah there are some really bad people

76
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:01,669
also into Western European governments
who are you seem to be bent on making us

77
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:10,039
into very nasty countries so I I've been
living in germany for mostly have for a

78
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,550
while and of course in Germany the whole
mass spying scene was kind of a big

79
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,869
thing because the German people they
have some experience of course with what

80
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:21,139
happens to your country when your
government goes really really bad and

81
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:26,240
they have still a memory of that and for
two weeks after Snowden on the plane to

82
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,469
Hong Kong and started talking to press
people Obama had a visit to Berlin

83
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:33,829
because that's the kind of thing you do
as an American president when you want

84
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:36,829
to get reelected to go to Berlin you
stand in front of the Brandenburger tor

85
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:40,400
you pretend to be john f kennedy and you
say things like

86
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,489
no la la of course the previous time
when Obama went to Berlin his is he

87
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,570
wasn't elected then yet that was before
he became president but he had one thing

88
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,199
going for him that he wasn't george bush
so all the Germans loved him for that

89
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,919
and then of course the next time he came
just after Snowden they didn't love him

90
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,690
that much anymore so very few people
actually came to his brandenburger tor

91
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:09,350
so then of course the new starts you
know and coming out so a former top guy

92
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:14,660
from the German Security Service who no
longer works there because he was old

93
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,889
enough to leave quietly said yeah and I
look all this and spying we're doing

94
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:23,150
what about terrorism it's about economic
espionage and and sometimes we are sort

95
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,638
of forced by the NSA to help them to spy
against European companies for American

96
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,400
companies right so so the NSA helps
Boeing still the secrets of Airbus and

97
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,270
this is hurting European economy and it
for talking about something like 250

98
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,039
billion euros a year 60 building alone
just for Germany and so it'sit's we're

99
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,919
talking about numbers of jobs economic
growth you know important stuff for us

100
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:51,948
and it's but it's not just against
bigger companies it's also against

101
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:56,300
smaller companies everybody is a target
so even if you have a bunch of French

102
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,880
agricultural companies you may actually
be a target of industrial espionage

103
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,870
which is enabled by you know
military-grade technology is executed by

104
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:12,800
military spy organizations like the NSA
and so all of this is controversial even

105
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,099
though the documentary proof has been
online now for a couple of years because

106
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:19,909
of course the political implications of
it are so very very painful too many

107
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:25,520
European governments so aside from
seeing from our companies to the tune of

108
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,680
hundreds of billions probably at least
as much as it's Chinese probably more we

109
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,320
really don't know Americans also use
their intelligence position which is

110
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,700
probably better than everybody else
except when it comes to terrorism there

111
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,290
they always miss the thing but with
everything else ever really good track

112
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,430
record now and so they use that to
manipulate political processes like the

113
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,640
2009 copenhagen conference on climate
change

114
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,780
which as you may remember completely
fell apart into pieces now frost forward

115
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,310
to 2015 where everybody is now aware of
the fact that this is happening and many

116
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,689
of the people who went to Paris to talk
about the climate again two measures to

117
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,950
not be spied on by the NSA and you might
have noticed that the result of that

118
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,550
conference were slightly different than
the one in copenhagen and so it helps to

119
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,319
push back even with very low check means
such as not carrying your phone with you

120
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,870
when you're having a sensitive
conversation so it is a beautiful

121
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,520
picture this building actually exists
within the NSA it's not as big game as

122
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:34,730
Big Jim and the twins and it used to be
an NSA listening post just on the edge

123
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,690
of Berlin when the cold war was still a
thing and so one of the things that the

124
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,770
NSA program has been doing is to monitor
all our porn surfing habits just on the

125
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:46,400
off chance that you might never become a
successful journalists activists

126
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,510
politician or whatever and then they
have this nice little crush on you of

127
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:57,439
you know to pressure you in a few if you
don't play ball enough so this is

128
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,620
nothing to do with fighting terrorism in
fact the NSA has never called a

129
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,030
terrorist in the last 15 years despite
says spending a considerable amount of

130
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:09,860
money eg more money than most countries
have on supposedly fighting terrorism

131
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,270
but their success rate right now is
limited to a single cab driver from san

132
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:19,280
diego transferring a thousand dollars to
a nonprofit organization in Somalia who

133
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,550
might have used some of those dollars
for something that we don't know that

134
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,750
that's the full extent of the success of
the NSA counter and counterterrorism

135
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,440
effort and of course they've been
listening to dangerous terrorists like

136
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,940
Angela Merkel Doctors Without Borders
Amnesty International the list goes on

137
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,210
so of course maybe not the people in
this room but many of our fellow

138
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,990
citizens are still very happily using
the facebooks Billington's to teachers

139
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,770
and all those other things that yes it
can be convenient and you know it might

140
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,800
even get too late but it also spies on
you right

141
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,520
so you have facebook is free but of
course it's not free you're paying and

142
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,340
not just with your privacy you're paying
with the privacy for everybody around

143
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,810
you and it's a real problem so it's like
the little piggies in the bar and you

144
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,768
know they get free housing free food and
all the antibiotics taken

145
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:09,339
eat and so maybe for the more naive pigs
among them it might seem like a really

146
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:13,689
good deal until of course the big steel
trucks shows up and then the deal is not

147
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:19,089
so good because it got taken away so
yeah if it's if it's free and if it's

148
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:22,569
not an open-source kind of thing and
you're not the customer your product

149
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:26,259
right you're not Facebook's customer
your facebooks product it's your

150
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:30,309
identity and knowledge and connections
that are being so same with google and

151
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:35,079
LinkedIn and Twitter and all those kinds
of companies and generate the same with

152
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:40,269
cloud computing stuff this is an actual
screen shot from a weather radar so I'm

153
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:43,209
not a religious person but at almost
believe that somebody doesn't like

154
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:44,498
Dutchman very much

155
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:48,429
that's where I'm from but as the Free
Software Foundation said and it's a

156
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:52,238
really good summary of what is known as
cloud computing there is no clouds yes

157
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:55,540
other people's computers and if your
stuff is important and it is it's on

158
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,079
somebody else's computer unit of the
root password then maybe you're doing

159
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:02,109
something wrong and it goes for
individuals but it certainly goes for

160
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,579
countries and medical institutions and
political parties and you know important

161
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:14,709
stuff so a lot of them sort of
suspicious people like me and others

162
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:19,359
already suspected of course that us
dominance in the IT world globally

163
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,920
wouldn't be used for espionage but now
of course we have the NSA internal

164
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,740
slides telling us so so that really
makes the discussion a lot easier

165
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,639
because it's no longer a debate the only
debate is are we going to do something

166
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,559
about it or are we just gonna surrender

167
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,089
so these are just some of the companies
whose products are fully back door when

168
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:42,009
you buy down and whether you as a
consumer or you as a national government

169
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:46,869
doesn't matter we can trust this stuff
which is a real problem because the

170
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:51,129
entire western world runs on its and a
more modern your country is more of this

171
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:52,299
stuff you have

172
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:56,290
and if we want to be Democratic
sovereign nations that are under control

173
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:01,689
of our stuff all of this needs to be
replaced all of it which is not easy

174
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:06,129
because there's no replacement for many
of these things right now so we're gonna

175
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:10,749
have to make those but you know hey
we're Europe we are 500 million fairly

176
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:14,439
highly educated smart people were the
largest economic bloc on the planet so

177
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:16,689
why couldn't we make the alternative for
this

178
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:17,680
oh by the way

179
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,910
buying all this crap every year is
costing us another 250 billion euros a

180
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:27,100
year so I'm thinking that's a lot of
jobs and I'm hearing that in some

181
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,220
countries people could use a couple of
job so maybe that's a good idea

182
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,410
so I'm now actually getting a bunch of
very large European companies to say

183
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:42,310
that's not totally crazy so slowly
removing at so it's not just software

184
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,869
it's not just you know the back doors
and windows and Macs and iOS and Android

185
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,220
phones and all that stuff

186
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,750
it goes all the dumb you know it goes
down to the hardware every internships

187
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,790
at post 2009 is back door when you get
it and there is very little to nothing

188
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,110
you can do about it now that doesn't
mean that you know the NSA is actively

189
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,010
listening to everything you do on your
laptop because maybe right now you're

190
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,660
not yet important enough

191
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,370
hey but you should you know you have the
ambition to be important enough because

192
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,130
you if you're another threat to anyone
ever in your life than what have you

193
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,950
been doing with your life reading you
know if you're not a serious competitor

194
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,270
to an American company if you are not
pressuring American politics at least a

195
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,510
little bit some somebody in your life
and again what have you been doing with

196
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,410
your life so journalists who tells me I
have nothing to hide and say well yeah

197
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,520
that's a problem

198
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,120
you're apparently not good enough it's
journalists to warrant some spying on

199
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,850
you then then what are you doing with
your life right so we're gonna need new

200
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,170
chips because these are not going to be
good for us because we cannot defend a

201
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,310
laptop or a server based on intel
chipset and I'd like to have a laptop

202
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,479
that I can defend against foreign
espionage and I'm and by the way i'm

203
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,630
willing to pay for it i'm willing to pay
a lot of money for a laptop that doesn't

204
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,029
have this but right now I can't buy that
one

205
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:01,329
I hope in five years I'll be able to buy
one and I'm willing to put down series

206
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:08,529
money for it and so will a lot of large
corporations so you know and we all saw

207
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:12,339
the new this right this isn't really
this is really really news

208
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:17,200
I mean isn't it kinda obvious that if he
if your country that runs the company

209
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,670
that runs ninety-five percent of the
world's desktop computers and if you're

210
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,640
in the business of industrial espionage
should put a little backdoor in it

211
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,829
I mean dull how obvious is that so we
should have started on but we didn't

212
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:30,479
want to know

213
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,100
but now we know for sure so now we need
to do something about it

214
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,079
so of course most of us don't have to
bother with this kind of crap because we

215
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,430
run proper operating systems if you
don't please start learning there's

216
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:49,290
people here that can help you and if you
don't get this joke then you need to

217
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,889
rewatch the last 15 minutes of silence
of the lambs and you'll see how bad it

218
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:59,279
really is i hear it can be downloaded
from the private bank do that so you

219
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,939
don't own your iphone if you're unlucky
enough to have one by the way same goes

220
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,250
probably for android phones the US
Department of Justice alleges that since

221
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,880
you're lost software is licensed your
opponents and since your licensing

222
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,740
licensing it from american company
really your phone legally speaking is us

223
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,940
sovereign territory and that means that
the Patriot Act's and it's little

224
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,649
sisters apply to your fun no matter if
you're not in the u.s. no matter if

225
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:29,550
you're not a US citizen no matter if you
never go to US doesn't matter

226
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,880
according to the US us sovereign
territory and they can do whatever the

227
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,779
hell they please with its and there's
nothing you can do about it because it's

228
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:40,620
already been pre bugged 16 different
ways by the NSA by the time you took it

229
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,459
out of the train box so this is all
really really quite disconcerting

230
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:52,290
now of course as they say in Germany and
and slimmer HD Merkley it can always get

231
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,219
worse so apparently somebody in u.s.
thought it was a good idea to do a

232
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,519
full-on military grade attack against
the country they were not at war with

233
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,620
and part of its civilian infrastructure
because of course we cannot have Iran

234
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,010
having civilian nuclear infrastructure
which is completely compliant with

235
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,160
international regulations even though
certain other countries in the region

236
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:17,130
have illegal nuclear weapons programs so
you know measuring by two standards so a

237
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,209
bunch of people develop the Stuxnet
virus to attack the Iranian civilian

238
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,829
nuclear infrastructure in The Times
which is completely legal then and still

239
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:33,360
is and of course that woke up the world
to the fact that digitalis warfare

240
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,530
against civilian infrastructure without
the claremore that is not with think

241
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:42,000
that Western countries do so what do you
think will the other countries are going

242
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,340
to do

243
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,639
well they're going to take the Stuxnet
virus going to decompile it and it going

244
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,120
to have some fun with it and which are
the countries that run most of the

245
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,239
siemens industrial controllers that you
can attack with the Stuxnet virus

246
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,918
of course it's the Western countries we
have automated everything because labor

247
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:02,049
is expensive here so take your average
western european or american country and

248
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:07,150
drop some Stuxnet typewriters in there
and things go badly badly wrong much

249
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:15,760
worse than in Iran or Russia or China so
that wasn't very smart to develop a

250
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,059
weapon that is most effective against us
and then send it off into the world

251
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:24,490
where everybody can make a copy of it at
zero cost so yeah there were quite a few

252
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,039
countries that were rather I'm pleased
about this fact

253
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,899
so you would think that after you know
messing up the middle east for about 30

254
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:36,010
years we should know by now as the West
that dropping weapons and unstable

255
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,080
regions of the world is a bad idea

256
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,220
dropping weapons that you can copy at
zero cost is like an exceptionally bad

257
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,020
idea but we did it anyway we the west
again you know my country the

258
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,710
netherlands is fully signed up member of
the war of terror and have been for 15

259
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:57,580
years so it's my text me and text my
network as well so we have all of that

260
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,779
going on and then of course we have the
SuperDuper special department within the

261
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:06,250
NSA call tailored access operations
apparently can violate people's

262
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,059
trademarks without being afraid of
everything because hey there Danny say

263
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:13,809
and of course if you do everything right
on your laptop you keep it offline you

264
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:16,570
encrypt your hard disk and super
passwords you don't leave it lying

265
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,918
around your tell ya there are still ways
they can get into that laptop to read

266
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:28,149
your encrypted texts thanks to Snowden
again and the really good analysis of a

267
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:31,928
lot of people in places like Berlin the
activist community there we know a lot

268
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:35,440
of technical details now the kind of
things they do and some of those things

269
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,299
really sound a bit like Star Trek but
they are really really real such as the

270
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:43,658
quartermaster produced a little orange
anything you see in the middle under the

271
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:48,820
USB plug which is molded inside USB plug
and if you plug that into your air gap

272
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,809
computer it now no longer is an
air-gapped computer now how does that

273
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:55,320
chip get into the USB plug that is

274
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,280
much to your scanner well you did the
wrong thing you bought this kind of

275
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,920
online using your own credit card in
your work address and then the package

276
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,430
got intercepted at three in the morning
at the post office and the chip was

277
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:12,300
added to plug to the scanner and unless
you know what to look for anyone happen

278
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,950
to have an x-ray machine you're never
gonna find it so this is just one of a

279
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,880
very large collection of to set that is
actively being deployed in Europe

280
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,990
against politicians companies
individuals activists doctors all kinds

281
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,890
of other people we don't know exactly
the scale but the fact that the CIA acts

282
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,480
as a manual with pictures and how to do
it tells you that it's not something

283
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,100
that happens like twice a year

284
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,110
this is more probably not happening on a
daily basis so don't order sensitive

285
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,530
stuff online buy with cash and don't
bring your phone when you do so might

286
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,600
buy your laptop cash in a store

287
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,270
yep it all sounds really really fucking
scary but here we are these artifacts

288
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,120
and then what are we going to do about
it

289
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,800
so the problem with all this stuff of
course is the technology always ends up

290
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,350
in the hands of everybody eventually
right

291
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:08,070
so once upon a time in america only had
nuclear weapons and then one more

292
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,840
country and then country 3456 and of
course by today probably three dozen

293
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,290
countries could build nuclear weapons if
they really wanted to and it'd be pretty

294
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:20,100
hard to stop them because we're talking
about 1940s technology how hard can it

295
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,399
be

296
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,070
it's just not that difficult in the end
this used to be super secret 25 years

297
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:33,090
ago now its on wikipedia and so again it
goes everywhere and of course yes

298
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,550
so the NSA build weapons and then they
lose them and then other people put them

299
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,659
on mega where you can now download them
right and yeah it's more to come

300
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,230
so somebody's gonna have a lot of fun
with a bunch of cisco routers in the

301
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,730
next couple of months and if you're
responsible for cisco routers you're

302
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,500
gonna have some pretty short nights that
predicts in the next half here so we're

303
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,880
putting this stuff in everything because
hey over-the-air software updates to

304
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,700
your car while you're driving because I
what could possibly go wrong with that

305
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,810
by because it's not like sometimes
software updates work something that

306
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,850
never happened

307
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:13,969
life isn't a fortune planes because hey
why not because nobody would ever bring

308
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,299
you know seems to bring in here and that
cable on board in her hand luggage right

309
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:23,660
yeah that's the same ethernet network
inside the plane that also runs the

310
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,130
management of the engines because you
know you want to run one ethernet cable

311
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,919
in the plane because that's like them
too so you have one physical network

312
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,210
that connects everything from the engine
management systems and including the

313
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,630
in-flight entertainment system and then
it's virtually separated based on

314
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,690
software i think some people here can
sort of see where this goes

315
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:46,549
yeah you can have a lot of fun with that
but don't do it because the airline will

316
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:48,530
not be amused at all

317
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:54,620
so what I think we should be doing is
have headlines like these which now it's

318
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,639
not real

319
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:03,169
regrettably not yet anyway but you know
give it another year or two we should

320
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:07,429
never really brought think about if we
want to keep using all this stuff that

321
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:11,659
we like to use because if all of it is
used to spying on us and not just use an

322
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:16,220
individual but on everybody around you
in your society your politicians your

323
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,780
doctors or lawyers the people who work
in an environmental activist

324
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,870
organizations to try to clean up your
country all those people are getting

325
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,199
spite against getting abused and they're
all the target in the real vulnerable

326
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,240
because they're all using hardware
software services that are all designed

327
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,049
to spy on them and you know sort of in
the process also do something cause a

328
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:41,780
useful like word processing so we need
to get rid of all of it so oh there's

329
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,690
still a bit of touching you and I
apologize for that

330
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,679
so there's two things that everybody
needs to do with their IT security one

331
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,679
upgrade your existing stuff as much as
possible

332
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:56,360
seriously you don't have an encrypted
hardest cases 2016 people seriously now

333
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:02,959
get your ass off the sea be able to
encrypt your chats you're all your

334
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,980
emails all that kind of stuff that
should be standard now but it isn't not

335
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,090
in most organizations but it should be
because the technology is around and

336
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,629
people to use it you can train people
how to use it's not rocket science and I

337
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,620
written a manual about it which I'm
gonna show you can download for free the

338
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:18,939
other

339
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,930
thing is that we need to start working
on overtime and this is like a 10-year

340
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:28,240
plan to completely rebuild a set of
tools from the hard rap operating

341
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,110
systems middleware layers applications
and then train people how to use those

342
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,250
which completely replaces all the crap
that we now know with absolute certainty

343
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,930
is not really good for us it's good for
other people but it's not good for us

344
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:45,280
it's expensive and it's breaking our
democracies and it's destroying our

345
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,810
economies and they're stealing from us
and so we should stop buying in and use

346
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:54,100
that money towards replacing it and in
the process you know create an

347
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,300
additional 250 billion euro ecotec
economy in Europe getting a lot of

348
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:05,200
people really cool jobs so there's like
three zones in any future in your IT

349
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,800
environment there's the internets which
is like the Wild West there's no

350
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,360
security at all there

351
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,040
I think we all know that if it's not
encrypted then you know you're done then

352
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,820
there is your IT environment which is
big and complex and has lots of holes

353
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,210
like web servers and mail servers and
all kinds of other crap and people not

354
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,930
using good passwords and how to use good
password and then write them down on

355
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:30,880
little yellow papers which they leave
underneath their keyboard so you should

356
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,010
have a third option which can be done to
day is that inside your organization you

357
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,340
have his own which can be a physical
place as well as a part of the

358
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,810
organization where people don't use
older all the unsafe stuff but they only

359
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:48,100
used to save stuff and they've got extra
training and you know they accept that

360
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,899
it's a little less convenience and there
you can have security so this could

361
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,490
maybe me part of your R&D department if
your company or if you're a company

362
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,240
maybe it's your legal department or it's
the part where you talk about the

363
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,350
information that impact the stock price
of a corporation or maybe it's the

364
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:09,730
research division of a journalistic
enterprise where you run to have some

365
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:13,420
really really secure systems you so you
can do the really interesting scary

366
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,660
stories where you probably know that
your government will be spying on you

367
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:21,370
when you start working on those so think
of it as a citadel now this can be as

368
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:25,449
simple as six or eight people who have
some special laptops with proper

369
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,590
encryption and have received some extra
training this is something you can do

370
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,290
and I've helped several media
organization

371
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,860
since actually setting this up and we
know that it works because they're right

372
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,030
sensitive stories and not even their own
governments can effectively spy on them

373
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:46,889
so again thanks to add we know that this
works encryption works of course often

374
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,620
the endpoints are so hopelessly key that
there's no need to break the encryption

375
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,179
they just have your laptop grab your
private key and now there goes the

376
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,830
effect of your email encryption but you
can make defensible systems you just

377
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:03,480
have to do stuff so if you're an IT
person you're building systems are

378
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,360
maintaining systems think very carefully
cannot protect this and and if we are an

379
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,409
organization that collects information
can be protected information and if we

380
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,230
can maybe we shouldn't collect it

381
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:20,010
so you know if you can protect it don't
collect it i think that's a good thing

382
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,310
now that's not always going to be
practically possible and i'm not saying

383
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,000
shut down your government today because
of it but maybe you want to make a plan

384
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,760
and work towards the situation where you
can protect the stuff and if that means

385
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,180
that some of the existing software
vendors need to go then somebody

386
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,690
existing software vendors need to go
because being in control over

387
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,950
information that's not a little thing
that touches everything you know that's

388
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,750
worthwhile in our society so this is
going to be with us for quite a while

389
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:53,159
um I think 10 years to fix this is a
very optimistic but doable thing i think

390
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,900
five years from now we could have secure
zones and most organizations we would

391
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,040
still also have completely insecure
zones with you know Microsoft Office

392
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,360
legacy and and all kinds of quality
cloud dangerous rough but we could have

393
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,219
that and then maybe in 10 or 12 or 15
years it could be normally to have a

394
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,720
secure computing platform with you no
audible on open software open source

395
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,680
software only that is checked and most
people understand what it is and can use

396
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,720
it and find it normal to not encrypt
email now to not send an encrypted email

397
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,830
where where we consider that route if
you send an encrypted email because now

398
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,939
you're destroying your privacy and the
privacy of the other person as well but

399
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,900
it's going to take a little while to get
there especially since most in most

400
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,570
organizations we haven't even started
yet and of course we should have started

401
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,550
in 2001 when we got the first solid
documents

402
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,960
about this so we've basically been
messing about 15 years and in the

403
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,190
intervening time to Europe spend about a
trillion euros that's a one with 12

404
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:55,720
zeroes on us software that spies on us a
trillion euros that we could have spent

405
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:01,090
on building software doesn't spy on us
so that's a bit of a policy fuckup but

406
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:06,159
now we know we can start fixing it and
that's of course what I want to do so in

407
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,300
2014 i wrote this book is called
information for journalists together

408
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,560
with Sookie Carlo london-based
journalists and activists and it's a

409
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,940
manual for journalists who are not very
technical and it helps them to learn

410
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,890
themselves or with a colleague or friend
in one or two days how to set up a

411
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:28,360
laptop securely against really like
high-level threats how to do things like

412
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,350
in 15 files encrypted emails have
encrypted chat older stuff and you also

413
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:36,310
didn't teach that stuff to their sources
so that they can protect themselves and

414
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:40,899
their sources which is a really
important bit so it's been downloaded

415
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,410
something like a quarter of a million
times now i think which should be more

416
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:49,240
but while there we are that's been used
in a couple of dozen countries and of

417
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,120
course even if you're not a journalist
but just want to have personal privacy

418
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,919
which is your human rights then again
use it the entire book is free on the

419
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,730
web you can download the desert ebook or
as a PDF for printing if that's your

420
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,940
thing and you can also read it on the
web while you're setting up your laptop

421
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,740
that's something that people like to do
if somebody wants to take this and make

422
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,180
a different version of its four kids if
you want to translate it into a language

423
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,130
then you don't need my permission

424
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,490
the whole book is creative commons
license so just grab it to do something

425
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,000
beautiful with it and let me know and
you know ask me out what you need but

426
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,440
you don't need my permission

427
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:32,380
so it's there do something good with in
so i think IT professionals are mostly

428
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,950
under estimating an important role they
could be playing and should be playing

429
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,810
in our society because most people don't
get this yet but i think some of the

430
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:45,010
people in this room at least technically
understand what we can do and what we

431
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:49,540
maybe should be doing and what kind of
all we should be playing and so we all

432
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,740
you know need to pay rent and make some
money in

433
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,570
the idea that but the real role is much
more bigger than that it's really about

434
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:00,770
the kind of countries we're going to be
living in are we going to be the factor

435
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,190
digitally occupied by a bunch of foreign
countries or are we going to have

436
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:08,450
something that looks like a democracy
now democracynow.org that perfect in

437
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:13,670
Europe don't get me wrong but it can be
so much worse than what we you know have

438
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:20,450
today so I'm making it both work in my
OB to do that and I'm trying to stitch

439
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:25,790
those as closely together as possible
and so a part of my time and work for a

440
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:29,000
company where I'm actually allowed to
say pretty much all these things in the

441
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,510
presence of you know very senior
managers was like suits on and stuff

442
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,020
like that and they haven't fired me yet
so so far so good

443
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,080
so next year there's going to be a
little party like this in the

444
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,100
Netherlands with a slightly higher
attendance because we have been doing

445
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,240
this for about 25 years and that was
once every four years so in just under a

446
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,070
year from now a short distance from
Amsterdam you're all invited to come

447
00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:01,189
you're also invited to submit ideas for
workshops talks project villages and all

448
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:05,840
kinds of other stuff if you want to
bring your kids that's cool

449
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,129
if you want to bring your dog that's
probably also possible if paying for a

450
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,510
plane ticket is difficult

451
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,650
let us know and we'll figure out
something for you it's going to be five

452
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:19,370
or six thousand people there a couple
hundred talks and hope that some of the

453
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,129
talks will be given by some of the
people who are here today and we

454
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,970
certainly invited to do is if you want
to volunteer in any other role then of

455
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:31,250
course also you're like super welcome to
and to join us so its online if you just

456
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:37,130
them put this sir phrase in your
favorite search engine them you can find

457
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:41,420
it there are links to our submission
system we use the same system as as

458
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:46,190
welcome users and I'm sure everybody
knows and all kinds of crazy ideas are

459
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:51,200
welcome so please join the party and
please do so in a very active way as a

460
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,960
volunteer or speaker or leader of a
workshop so this is the company I work

461
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,340
for this is our sailboat and we use it
as a very secure offshore location to

462
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,480
have discussions

463
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,620
because if you sail away from the coast
and you're outside of gsm range and you

464
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,469
unplugged a little in more something
then you're like really really really

465
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,679
are flying and then you can have like a
real grown-up conversation about what

466
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:14,600
you really want to do with IT security

467
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,080
I'm it's also just a fun thing to play
with and so I get to play with it every

468
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,918
now and then which is really really cool
it's like a nice little side benefit so

469
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,919
we know what the technological policy is
to systems we can trust

470
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,350
we know that free software is the
keystone of it we know that Hardware

471
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,969
made based on the same principles is key
part of it all of these things can be

472
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:40,100
done and most of the things have already
been done

473
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,809
we just need to stitch it together into
systems that non checking people can and

474
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:48,230
want to use and we need to explain to
them how important it is and we need to

475
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:52,429
explain it to our politicians and to the
people running companies and hospitals

476
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:56,660
and institutions and that's one of the
jobs that we have and of course we need

477
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,290
to make sure that it technically works
brilliantly and that it's free both as

478
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:05,750
in euros and most importantly as in
freedom so I plan to be doing that for

479
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:10,460
the next five to ten years and this is
one of the companies i'm going to be

480
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,409
doing it for but i'm also going to be
doing in my free time so if people are

481
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:20,030
interested in this and all kinds of ways
then you can contact me if you want to

482
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:26,899
do stuff here and have me help you talk
to some politicians contact me if you

483
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,879
want to come to shop but don't know how

484
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,649
contact me if you have questions then
there is Mike right there and I think we

485
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:39,500
have another 20 minutes or so for Q&A so
right now if people have questions or if

486
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,399
you don't have a question afterwards and
i'm here till sunday exceedingly like

487
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:47,449
about forty recordings please hop to the
mic if you have one if you have a

488
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:51,230
question or suggestion but don't do your
own speech if you want to do your own

489
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,290
speech then contact balcon and they're
gonna slap you in next year

490
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,410
thank you

491
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:01,810
yeah

492
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:17,830
hi I have a question what's your opinion
on cyber insurance that European Union

493
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:24,759
needs to implement as mandatory for
every company in 2017 cyber insurance

494
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,290
insurance

495
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,680
yeah as in as in with insurance company
mean yeah

496
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,890
insurance companies are developing cyber
insurance

497
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:36,790
yes I know I i think i understand that
for the insurance companies can be a

498
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:40,029
profitable business although i think
that some of them are under estimating

499
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,990
the amount of money that they might have
to pay out the problem I see with it is

500
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:50,259
that an activity that an organization
should be doing you know making their IT

501
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:54,700
secure so that the human rights of
privacy of the people that they work for

502
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:00,580
it doesn't get damaged is now something
you can buy off so i'm a little bit

503
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:06,940
afraid of where that could end up going
so I think if if a company messes up and

504
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:10,930
leaks the private information of people
because they've messed up i think we

505
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:16,419
should make the find so high that it
becomes very difficult to ensure and

506
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:21,040
then eventually will make you find so
high that is just cheaper to just fix it

507
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,130
because that's what we want so we don't
want IT insecurity to become a profit

508
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,990
Center for financial services companies
what we want is for you to problem to be

509
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:36,220
fixed right because it's because it's
it's the information of real human

510
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,240
beings like you and me including their
personal private information when they

511
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,129
talk to the doctor or problems they have
with their families that ends up being

512
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:49,600
open on the internet and I'm not sure I
violating somebody human rights to

513
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,640
privacy should be something that you can
just buy off with Swiss ray so I

514
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,560
understand the business but I think we
should just keep upping defines until

515
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,980
the insurance company say I we're not
going to do this anymore because then

516
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:06,190
people will be forced to fix it so
that's I think

517
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:11,680
yep yep think you have another question
you for showing the slide with vendors

518
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,259
that have

519
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:16,730
backdoor that our contract partners with
Tennessee there's a finnish company

520
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:22,940
called jolla have heard about that they
have that selfish operating system for

521
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:28,490
mobile devices which can be insulted
Andrea already pre-sold devices doing

522
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:34,640
that they have this partnership with NSA
because it's and community-based yeah

523
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,330
it's very it's very hard to know for
sure because one of the conditions on

524
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:42,259
having a relationship with the NSA is
that you cannot talk about your

525
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:47,120
relationship with the NSA and if you do
you could end up in jail for a very long

526
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,819
time and this is really really serious

527
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,030
so part of when especially when you're
an American company when you get a

528
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:57,440
national security letter that instruct
you to now surrender control of your

529
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,910
technology to the NSA the letter very
clearly states if you talk about this to

530
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,319
anyone ever

531
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,860
we will throw the full legal book of
anti-terror law at you and your company

532
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:11,270
which basically means that you're gonna
be screwed for life and everybody worked

533
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:15,920
with you so it's very hard to know for
sure if somebody complies with that or

534
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,000
not I remember Leena store falls was
once asked this question about the linux

535
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,960
kernel if he had ever been approached by
the NSA to put it back to our in the

536
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:32,930
linux kernel and so you know he was
being recorded so he said no that's what

537
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:37,220
he did and so I'm but of course lots of
other people can look at the code of the

538
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,120
name is Colonel so we have to at least a
sporting chance of detecting any you

539
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,049
know nasty stuff that somebody wants to
put in there so I'm so i'm i'm not so

540
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:49,790
needless to say if we make everything
open source all our problems go away but

541
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:54,170
I do think it's a it's a precondition to
even having a fighting chance in the

542
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:58,340
same way that being a democracy doesn't
make all your problems go away but if

543
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,610
you're not a democracy you're already
completely screwed right and there's no

544
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:07,520
way to fix it so so free software is not
the solution to everything but it's part

545
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,009
of the critical condition to being able
to fix something so that's why I think

546
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:16,010
it's important thank you

547
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:27,020
you've discussed how Europe should do
something about American flying and I

548
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:31,130
guess this is making me hopeful that
something is going to happen but I'm

549
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:36,349
curious in other countries including
America but not just including America

550
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:41,720
like all the other continents what
people are thinking about this but also

551
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,799
i know for a fact in many Asian
countries India of China of course

552
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:51,319
Russia and most latin american countries
this is already a very normal way to

553
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:54,259
talk about things and that doesn't mean
that they're already technologically

554
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,290
there but at least into thinking of the
people who are doing the long-term

555
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:02,660
planning this is a fairly normal way to
discuss matters so so in your personal

556
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,710
especially in Western Europe of course
we're still very much like us fanboys i

557
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:12,530
think here is a hopefully a little less
for very good reasons by the way but but

558
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:16,130
certainly in Western Europe we still you
know obama and he's so nice and your

559
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:20,119
love of Allah and of course he kills 12
children's with drawings on a daily

560
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:23,089
basis but somehow he's a nice guy
because he did something for us

561
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:26,240
healthcare I don't know how that meant
he works with people but apparently that

562
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,470
works i'm still hoping that at some
point the US population will be fed up

563
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:35,930
with and what's being done to them but I
don't see it happening regrettably which

564
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:42,440
is sad and worrying but I'm also like
okay sorry I'm i'm going to be worried

565
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,730
about like the 500 million people that I
live close to first and let's see if we

566
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:51,200
can fix that and you know then maybe we
can help the people in the colonies fix

567
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,660
their problems eventually but right now
that's like it slower on my personal

568
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:02,629
priority list so so that's why but i'm
hoping at some point you know and it may

569
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:07,430
be after they elect Trump somebody will
wake up to how badly that crap is

570
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:12,020
certainly after they elect to Hillary
people open because that's even worse in

571
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,950
my view but you know that's a personal
opinion so I'm still hoping that

572
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,790
somebody will wake up there to just how
bad things are the fact that you're in

573
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:23,299
one of the richest industrialist
countries in the world and your breeches

574
00:41:23,299 --> 00:41:26,420
are falling into the rivers you know
what's up with that and your children

575
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,030
can't healthcare what's up with that

576
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:33,190
but yeah if you just have yet to see it
so maybe somebody will wake up it would

577
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:43,300
be cool but there for me is like my
neighbors first alright i just had a mic

578
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,030
just talking

579
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:50,950
I a measure of our problems about chips
being back toward okay we can all

580
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:55,330
encrypted hard drives files you know
like use open source software but the

581
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:59,200
problem with the chips is it requires a
lot of money you know so can you give us

582
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,870
a little more information about what's
being done about it

583
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:07,420
so um so there's no reason why you could
not develop alternative chips including

584
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:11,020
shipment I mean we have micro chip
manufacturing capability in Europe it's

585
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,620
not you know we're usually without
competing head-to-head with Intel

586
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:20,140
because nobody dares to and because you
couldn't do it you know in a profitable

587
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:25,600
way since there is no market demands for
something like an intel chip that is

588
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:31,900
worse than intel chip but it doesn't
have a back door and so I think now with

589
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,780
the kind of conversation I'm having and
lots of other people are having about

590
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:39,430
the need for secure system we're trying
to create a market for something that is

591
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:43,960
like a general cpu that might not be as
good as the latest internship in terms

592
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,500
of price performance and power
consumption versus performance but that

593
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:52,780
has the massive advantage of not being
backdoored and so my maybe people are

594
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,620
willing to pay a premium for having a
not backdoor chip and then we could just

595
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,980
make those and european space agency
made some pretty good designs in the

596
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:05,080
nineties on risk chipsets that you can
put into an fpga for instance and the

597
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:09,220
doses eyes are completely publicly
accountable because they were paid for

598
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,790
with the tax money of Europeans so
designs are open and we own them

599
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:17,020
together so anybody can just grab that
and run with it so i'm not saying that

600
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:22,990
that's the solution but maybe it's a
starting point and so the hardware part

601
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:25,810
is probably the more difficult part of
this total equation because actually the

602
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:29,830
sulfur stack we already have to suffer
stack we just need to explain people to

603
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:34,990
use it so this is more than educational
thing and a government policy thing fine

604
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:38,589
stop standardizing your entire
educational system on Microsoft products

605
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,630
that sounds like a nice idea for
instance

606
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:46,390
the hardware stuff is actually difficult
and expensive but if we don't have

607
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:50,710
secured where none of the rest makes
sense so we have to do both and we have

608
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:54,520
to do it within a few years but there is
a viable technological parts of doing

609
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:59,380
and we just have to get enough sort of
demand for it and and the crazy thing is

610
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,500
that probably economically the answer is
going to be a bunch of very large

611
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,190
corporations to say okay we're willing
to drop some significant money on fixing

612
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:10,300
this for ourselves and then or if we
already fix it we might as well sell it

613
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,650
to everybody else at some sort of
causing reasonable price and and I'd be

614
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,520
happy to pay five times what I'm being
now from my cpu if it doesn't come with

615
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,270
a back door

616
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:23,320
alright so so I think there's an answer
out there but it's gonna take us a

617
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,340
couple years to fix it but there's also
a business opportunity for the companies

618
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:32,500
to do it so there is money to be made
here to to fix a big political social

619
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,860
problem so I'm hoping that you know
somebody will pick that up i'm not a

620
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,880
hardware expect expert myself but
somebody out there is gonna do this and

621
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,500
somebody is going to be working at that
company in having a great time and I

622
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:50,620
think also a nice job so I think there's
a path there any other questions yeah

623
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:54,279
i'm gonna do the roving mics in now

624
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:58,029
thank you

625
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:02,890
now first of all I'd like to thank you
for your lecture today I had a chance to

626
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:05,740
listen to at Russia today

627
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:10,209
alright yes it was it was similar
subject and this is something I'm very

628
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:14,980
interested in as I'm working in a
company that deals with a very sensitive

629
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:20,500
user information first I would like to
our left ask two questions first of all

630
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,210
would be something that I'm personally
interested in the result of us recently

631
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:33,160
about Apple not being able to unlock an
iphone for the FBI and yeah you should

632
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,450
never believe anything I tell you right
yes and that's that there is like a huge

633
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,450
huge BR right yeah

634
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:46,299
no right i think i think the Apple PR
department did absolutely brilliant on

635
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:50,619
that and it doesn't make a really make a
difference it is quite possible actually

636
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:55,450
that's the FBI cannot open an apple
because the NSA refuses to give the FBI

637
00:45:55,450 --> 00:46:01,060
dear tools because the NSA knows that
the FBI skating at Weeki by the Chinese

638
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:05,950
because they just can't security systems
are even worse than the NSA on that and

639
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:10,000
of course the NSA is the organization
that lost million-and-a-half top-secret

640
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,930
documents to an external contractor was
a high school dropout and they don't

641
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:17,470
know which ones to this day so that
tells you about the quality of their

642
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:23,049
internal controls which are less than
perfect shall we say things and the

643
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:26,380
other question would be there was a
previously a question regarding

644
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:34,450
insurance but as I know you has a
director that will become valid on 2018

645
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:40,390
yeah that will like the insurer
liability of companies that deal with

646
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:46,328
sensitive user do so with my company
loses or something gets I don't

647
00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:50,980
mishandled with gathered user data my
company will be held liable to do think

648
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:57,400
that will really change something or yes
I do think in the Netherlands where I'm

649
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:04,810
working with this the finest now is nine
hundred thousand euros per case and in

650
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:11,560
Europe define can be up to four percent
of your global protects revenue as a

651
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:16,599
company with a maximum of i think twenty
million euros per case where it's

652
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:22,210
actually the oversight body determines
what a cases so if you five times lose

653
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:27,430
the data of a thousand people is at five
cases or 5,000 cases and that that's yet

654
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:33,819
to be determined by dead by the lawyers
my personal view is that if you can

655
00:47:33,819 --> 00:47:39,099
ensure a wages risk then defines aren't
high enough right

656
00:47:39,099 --> 00:47:43,030
so with for instance abusing a monopoly
position into you

657
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:50,709
microsoft was fined 1.8 billion euros
and that probably was to lower fine

658
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,700
given how much money they made of the
monopoly

659
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:57,649
so I think we should make defined so
painful and so high that most companies

660
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:03,349
simply will not dare to take the risk
and will invest significance efforts in

661
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:07,550
employing smart people and in fixing
their check to make sure that the risk

662
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:10,910
is like really really exceedingly low
instead of something that happens every

663
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:16,399
week in some European country so again
it may very well be that a 20 million

664
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,390
euro fine for a multinational
corporation is simply to lower amount of

665
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:25,549
money we'll see but already the fact
that now it costs 20 million screw up

666
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:27,260
instead of almost nothing

667
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:31,609
he is already getting a lot of companies
very interested in this sort of stuff so

668
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:35,810
so if you compare the kind of questions
are being asked now also in a commercial

669
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:40,670
space about this sort of stuff versus
two years ago is a completely different

670
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:45,560
universe so even you know what the
900,000 0 finer 220 million fine which

671
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,450
for large corporations chicken feed

672
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:50,720
that's already helping but maybe it
needs a little bit more and maybe we

673
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,609
need to have a few spectacular scandals
to make that clear politicians and it's

674
00:48:55,609 --> 00:48:58,279
quite possible so I'm always hoping that
we're going to have a data leak

675
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:02,630
involving some very famous artists or
members of the royal family or stuff

676
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:06,050
like that because then that's really you
know we'll get everybody's blood pumping

677
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:11,119
so so here's I'm not saying go hack the
royal family please don't you'll be in

678
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:11,660
jail

679
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:16,819
don't do that but should it happen it
might not be the worst thing policy-wise

680
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:21,770
thank you sure anyone else

681
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,280
yep ok I'm so if their normal questions
for now if you want to talk to me

682
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,090
offline

683
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:42,950
there's email and chat and i'm going to
be here physically until sunday exciting

684
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:43,759
day

685
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,720
so talk to me thank you very much for
being in your attention and I hope to

686
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,529
see all of you next year in the
Netherlands had to add our party at cha

687
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:57,320
gonna be beautiful weather and there's
water and harbor and cool stuff and you

688
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,320
come right okay

689
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:08,670
ok

690
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:09,569
yeah
