1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:28,740
okay so everyone i am automotive sean i
am from the insurer me up so we are very

2
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,219
close and I'm a really happy to be here
and have the chance to talk to you all

3
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,079
thank you for your interest in being
here so thank you to the organizers for

4
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,940
having me here

5
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,300
what I would like to talk you talk to
you about is a harder manufacturing and

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:55,680
that is because uh I think we share test
of thank you i think we share something

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,660
in common i am a maker myself I am
trained as a software developer but

8
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,018
electronics was a longer time hobby of
mine

9
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:11,700
so what I did recently was just to move
from my boring job if you want and do

10
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,030
the things I enjoy most and that is very
well connected to making hacking and the

11
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:27,420
interesting projects which i like to use
my time on and the think about hacking

12
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:34,740
making having fun with electronics and
everything is that it can go on a very

13
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,759
interesting group if you're just a bit
careful about planning some details and

14
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,000
trying to get to give on the result what
I'm trying to say here is that usually

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,890
what we do looks like this so that's
what we enjoy doing and that brings us

16
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,750
great satisfaction

17
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,360
the problem is that you might be doing
some high voltage experience experiments

18
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,739
and then run into problems if you don't
clear this properly so I done that and I

19
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:17,160
enjoyed it a lot and some of my projects
included lots of sparks robots and

20
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,220
things like those and you can still see
some of that work on my blog i still

21
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,050
enjoy doing that unfortunately time is a
problem and the one thing I used to say

22
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,090
to my friends is that we are all doing
the wrong thing we should actually quit

23
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,590
our jobs and start thinking about
building a time machine because then we

24
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,840
would solve all our problems so after
having a lot of fun

25
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:50,070
we offer these interesting experiments
one day I decided to do a step further

26
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:55,799
and that was to take one of my projects
which was developed like actually

27
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,430
previously on the messy desk and just
try to put into production why I did

28
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:09,540
that was because I wanted to build a
tool which is not useful just for myself

29
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,200
but also for others but in that case you
can't just deliver a bunch of messy

30
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,890
cables so the trick here was to be a bit
more organized and this is how i managed

31
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:29,040
to bring a toy developed in my free time
time as a hobby project to something

32
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:36,150
approaching a product which will
actually enter the market and the the

33
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,060
challenge was stuff really like going
into this direction and the stopping the

34
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,489
playtime and just trying to get more
serious about the things I did was

35
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,930
difficult because there are so many
aspects which needs to be taken into

36
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,660
consideration when you're trying to
build your own hardware product and the

37
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,030
one of the biggest challenges are
related to the resources that you have

38
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,760
you know that for softer it's a
complicated thing to do like you need to

39
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,790
have all that architecture organization
of the cold and then all the testing in

40
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:20,430
order to have something that works for
hardware is at least double the effort

41
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:26,850
to get the result because hardware
exists in two dimensions you also have

42
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,150
the software you need to have fewer for

43
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,039
digital electronics so you get the
software development part there as well

44
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,950
but then for harder you get all those
testing related to interference ease you

45
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:46,710
have an inductor which can actually just
ruin your entire PCB and then you need

46
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:54,390
to start over so things are good because
here's Dave holding one of the early

47
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:01,530
products i was able to do just playing
and moving from my desk to something

48
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,989
which could I could actually put into
production if they was happy then I'm

49
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:13,410
happy as well what can I say he usually
just throws curses to everything and

50
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,840
he's a very hard to please guy but
there's the time Bob so that's really

51
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,330
great

52
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:27,960
so of course the next thing was to scale
up and that wing that means a single

53
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:36,359
thing vol you need more you needs you
need to build more and just remember

54
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,440
when we started we used to have fun we
used to play we used to have a messy

55
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:47,010
desk but now we need to keep up with
demand we need to be better organized

56
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:54,330
and most important time needs to be
enough to get the job done and this is

57
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,039
actually a very big problem here already
just to to see those bunch of units

58
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,870
there are just imagine how much time you
will need to solder those by hand using

59
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:10,770
SMD components just imagine how much
time it takes to screw in all those

60
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,060
eight screws on the enclosure so it
really adds up

61
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,010
so when I just finished everything you
realize that you have unsure the testing

62
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,400
doesn't go go then you need to start
over

63
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,880
so these are tough challenges so what I
did and this is the thing I want to talk

64
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,290
to you about and really this is not a
monologue I want to get too involved so

65
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,850
feel free to ask questions whenever you
want because these are some lessons i am

66
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,560
willing to share with you

67
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,940
the next thing I did was just to go on
alibaba it's that unfriendly site maybe

68
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:53,460
you know while express i'm sure you know
ebay from buying stuff I'll express is

69
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,729
also nice alternative then you have that
bow

70
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,450
I never got my packages from barrett
anyone was able to be successful and

71
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:05,010
about good people you need to tell me
what I did wrong there so I'm really

72
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,510
curious to find out

73
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:17,580
ok so I i missed that parolee so what I
did with valibar was to try to get to

74
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,159
the people I needed those included pc
manufacturers in the first place but

75
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,520
then I also needed companies doing
aluminum processing I wanted to have the

76
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,830
product i was building put into our
meeting Mike Rogers so for that i needed

77
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:40,650
various companies doing various things
but most important I need to find a way

78
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:46,409
to put everything together like having a
central spot where everything is being

79
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:53,340
centralized to have someone that is able
to assemble things to test things and

80
00:07:53,340 --> 00:08:00,390
just ship them to the destinations i was
interested in and this is this was a

81
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:05,550
blessing really doing this was probably
the most important thing for this

82
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,880
project which actually started as me
having fun in my spare time because i

83
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,680
was able to find the not one but i think
three companies doing Armenian

84
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:24,419
manufacturing and I had the chance to
try a two of them because in the first

85
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:30,270
place of course just browsing alibaba it
was like finding very many suppliers

86
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,439
which said yeah we can do everything
from work we fast

87
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,050
try us we are the best but actually not
all of them are able to deliver what

88
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,039
they promise

89
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:47,699
so it was important to to test them then
for the PCB manufacturing there were

90
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,860
also other companies that can do this
part

91
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,360
also assembling so it's interesting to
see that most of the companies just

92
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,990
deliver the PCBs but you can find a few
that also do assembling so no more so

93
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,279
during by hand

94
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:09,290
you can have the job done in China and
really there is a big advantage here

95
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:15,079
imagine you have to solder like 10
boards for a product you are working on

96
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:20,209
so everything is fine just follow the
design you have the solar in place and

97
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:25,099
then comes the testing where you see
that like three or four boards fail for

98
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,860
some unknown reason maybe it's a problem
with the solarin or maybe something

99
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,140
unknown something related to voodoo
happening on your board and the body

100
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:41,779
part simply doesn't want to work so what
do you do you just start testing it you

101
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:47,630
take out your service cute or scope and
you waste a lot of time just to find out

102
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:53,089
that there is a small piece of cooper
somewhere just touching something and

103
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:58,430
that knows everything away and your
waist however they on board just to find

104
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:05,359
that problem that's not okay and that
Vantage is that when you have a contract

105
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,079
with manufacturer you pay for working
boards so it's their problem that they

106
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:18,349
are having defects or problems in
assembly you get the finger paid for and

107
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:23,839
you waste no time and this is this is
really important especially when you're

108
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,940
trying to build something from the
bottom up because as you know resources

109
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:35,449
are limited and you need to calculate
everything very carefully if you are to

110
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:42,649
to get somewhere we feed and then of
course it's important for for a partner

111
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:50,899
to to be able to deliver quality that
you can trust like you need to you you

112
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:54,769
need to make your customers if you want
or partners or the guys you're

113
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:59,930
delivering too happy about the product
you're delivering and this is a tough

114
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,589
challenge really personally I never been
to China

115
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:10,919
so that might be tricky because you need
someone to supervise what's happening

116
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,879
there

117
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,639
it's a problem of trust if you want you
need to either to be to be capable of

118
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:23,399
trusting your partner or two to
supervise it very closely so I don't

119
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,929
have an answer for you on this one for
me toward just fine i was able to find

120
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:33,269
the company and the things went well
with those guys for like two years now

121
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:41,759
and i can say that i would continue to
work with those guys as well so do you

122
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,649
have any questions on the this mechanism
going from alibaba torture people in

123
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:55,259
China and you would like to know
something related to this more how many

124
00:11:55,259 --> 00:12:01,979
you need you have to make to start
collaborating with them that's that's a

125
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:07,919
great question because usually the
quantity is a quoted in numbers starting

126
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:15,659
with 4 500 units and go up but the guys
i worked with and the some other side

127
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:20,399
found because I try to have some
redundancy I didn't play everything on

128
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,289
one card

129
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:29,039
well i was able to find guys that agreed
to work on country quantities up to 100

130
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:37,379
and that was perfect and also they in
some cases agreed to offer test boards

131
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:43,829
like 10 or 20 of them of course those
are a bit more expensive but nothing to

132
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,909
compare with what I was I would get
locally

133
00:12:53,939 --> 00:13:00,719
is there anything else okay how much it
takes to have a prototype from china to

134
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:09,749
Romania so the prototype I'm ability it
myself i was able to do to layer boards

135
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:16,529
using the hotter on you know that matter
the transferring toner things like those

136
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:21,659
and that worked fine of there was that
picture there where I told you that I

137
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:26,789
was trying to do everything more
standardized and I just try to shape it

138
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:31,199
into a product that that image there was
actually a board which I was able to do

139
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:35,669
myself so the product that is local that
that's very important and then when you

140
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:36,629
place the order

141
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:41,069
you just need to export their profiles
and make sure you have no mistakes there

142
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:42,929
because there is no turning back

143
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:48,389
if there was a mistake you're just throw
them away and the it takes like two

144
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:52,589
weeks to get the manufacturing done
quantities are really not important here

145
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:58,649
like they have the machinery to cover
big numbers and then you could count the

146
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:03,809
shipping back like one week so it's a
delay of like three weeks from the

147
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,348
moment you click it on your computer and
you get that actually goods delivered

148
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:12,869
but I don't know how things are here in
Serbia but in Romania we also have the

149
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:20,459
customs office and those guys love us a
lot because they always but always delay

150
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,868
with one extra week

151
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:26,189
no it's not that really that they don't
do that anymore but it's enough that

152
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:33,179
they are a big pain in the deep and the
ok so what was the problem here is i was

153
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:37,799
include in one of the is Romania and
there was this topic on open innovation

154
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,629
it's a great topic nowadays and open
innovation the water related to the

155
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:49,979
thing that in the this moment of time we
are leaving we have so little time for

156
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:54,809
everything so the idea is to try to
speed up the development to try to put

157
00:14:54,809 --> 00:15:00,269
creativity to work at a faster pace so
if you have idea to have everything you

158
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:04,829
need to be able to get on the market
this was the topic and the one of the

159
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:07,589
proposed solutions was to see the city

160
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,420
an entire city as a playground what does
that mean it means that if someone like

161
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:18,300
me or your consumer product to find the
trust to have your product affected

162
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:24,180
faster because if you don't do that the
startups especially will have no chance

163
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:30,209
to to get the right . because it takes
so many certifications it takes so much

164
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,990
time so many resources to actually get
on the market on the traditional way

165
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,580
so this is a problem that stops progress
if you want

166
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:43,440
so the problem here is that it's great
to have the city as a playground

167
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,589
unfortunately the customs office are so
far away from this concept really so

168
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,260
obstacles all around
