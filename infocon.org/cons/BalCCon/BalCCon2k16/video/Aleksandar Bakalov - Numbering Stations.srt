1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:33,120
our next lecture is about numbering
stations by a bacalov enjoy right

2
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,680
hello-o enormous crowd alright so I'm
speaking in front of amateur radio club

3
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,649
of the union and they are going to talk
about numbering stations which is just

4
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:53,670
sick now we can start all right so we're
going to talk what their those

5
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,700
mysterious stations and you're actually
going to hear one on the welcome this

6
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,629
year but let's start

7
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,490
ok so before we actually start the
lecture

8
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,909
let's agree on asking questions you can
of course use the low-tech and yell at

9
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,490
me or you know just as for the
microphone and as the question but i

10
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,490
prefer to do it like this you can go
using your smart phones you can go to

11
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:34,439
slider . com or slide or if you're from
Bosnia and then you enter the same 49

12
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,929
which is the session number for this
session and you can ask any question

13
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,780
using your smartphone and i will see it
and a zone as soon as it is possible i

14
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,150
will answer the question and that will
continue until the end of the numbering

15
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:56,369
station day meaning that we will be
answering any questions that you might

16
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:04,710
have via slide also alright so i'll give
you just the minute or two just to

17
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,068
remember the name and maybe register

18
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:14,939
ok so what are numbering or number
stations this very interesting

19
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:23,010
mysterious think that I learned about
couple of years ago and it is like

20
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:32,879
cross-section of ham radio cryptography
mystery and hacking whatever so it was

21
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:41,159
very interesting to me hopefully it will
be similar to so numbers station in

22
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:47,250
essence are shortwave radio station
which have encrypted emissions and

23
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:55,109
basically you hear some intro playing
some cod weird creepy music usually some

24
00:02:55,109 --> 00:03:00,989
children students or something like that
and after that it comes to pay load and

25
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:07,109
then it sounds like a sequence of
numbers or alphabetic sequence and then

26
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:14,549
it has the signed out zone and after
that you might not hear it for weeks and

27
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:17,459
nobody actually knows what are those

28
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,709
nobody knows for sure who owns the
station and what the purpose of those

29
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:30,209
stations are the prophecies there are
some strong hypotheses on water does but

30
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:39,989
up to this point there are very very few
leads on actual origins and usage of

31
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:47,760
those stations so let's just start with
with time context of those stations the

32
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,230
first number in station appeared only
enough more than counted years ago

33
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,018
during the first of all so the vilest
radio was new and interesting technology

34
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:05,040
back then and it made sense maybe to
transmit coded messages to the people

35
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,909
are in the times of war it was certainly
faster than the children carriers or

36
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:12,940
whatever they use

37
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,899
to carry messages them so we still have
them

38
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:24,849
yes most certainly do and there is no
sign of them turning away anytime soon

39
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:30,250
so we have a large number of numbering
stations we don't know horns then we

40
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,230
don't know who transmits or what it is
transmitted but there are community

41
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:41,620
efforts at least track them classify and
try to get as much information maybe

42
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,490
location of the transmitters that is to
do you know you can locate the

43
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:52,900
transmitters some of them are located in
military bases and actually the

44
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,159
strongest hypothesis for the number
stations is that they are used by

45
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:05,530
governments and so they can communicate
with the spice on in some foreign

46
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:13,090
country because then you send a message
via internet or why a telephone or

47
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,109
whatever you have a communication
channel which can ultimately be traced

48
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:24,280
you cannot be 100-percent anonymous
someday but difficult have a broadcast

49
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:31,780
of course as their ways to be almost
untraceable but when you have a higher

50
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:38,830
h8s station which transmits some coded
message and then you have a receiver

51
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,289
nobody can trace you anywhere you know
you're just listening to the shortwave

52
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,550
transmissions

53
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:51,940
so who use them probably governments and
there are some famous cases on less

54
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:59,560
famous case for improved to this park
that hypothesis was in 1998 all the

55
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:08,890
traffic it wasn't that long ago in list
of some games about the spice from Cuba

56
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,870
and us five Cuban spice were arrested
and

57
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,900
the convicted for many many years and
that was actually the first time that

58
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:28,150
you had in in court trials you can
mention of numbering stations and so

59
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,700
that's kind of a proof and also they
decrypt some of the messages which is

60
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,690
very important

61
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:40,240
interesting but we'll get to that so on
one side you have a government's so this

62
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,380
is resilient way to send the messages of
course this is not the primary channel

63
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,000
of course this is not the primary
channel to communicate with spice it's a

64
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,500
backup channel like probably some of you
might know that you have a airplane

65
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:02,800
industry and it's all high-tech and
everything but it's a backup scenarios

66
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,980
for navigation you do get you still here

67
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:12,040
non-directional beacons meaning small
transmitters that if everything else

68
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:19,000
fails on airplane for any reason they
can rely on listening for at least a

69
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,710
couple of them and they have a navigator
who can calculate by triangulation and

70
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:30,130
he knows the position of those beacons
he can exactly determine the position of

71
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:36,070
the plane maybe I don't know 10 15 feet
50 meters that's enough for four you

72
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,580
know if everything else fails so the
numbering stations are probably the

73
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:47,380
failsafe and the backup channel for
communicating that people it is very

74
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:52,210
very interesting because you don't have
to care some very high-tech gear to

75
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,770
listen to them and as I said you're
probably untraceable

76
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:04,690
so who use them besides the government
most probably drug cartels so it is easy

77
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:10,570
for them to organize and to synchronize
of course they have the organization

78
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:16,570
comparable by structure with the
government's so they they have a people

79
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:21,130
on the training in other countries and
if you care for example if you have to

80
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,639
ask mr. here you can transmit in
Hungarian in boston yan

81
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,289
crazy whatever and nobody can touch you
here but you're going to speed that

82
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:34,689
message to your foot soldiers and you
know inform them about I don't know

83
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:44,769
changing in the drug prices or whatever
so didn't this was during the first hour

84
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:50,589
so the technique was new and everything
was new and interesting to them so

85
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:58,570
probably you know they figure out why
not to use it and let me try to show you

86
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:04,060
how the typical are numbering station
sounds like so this is just the

87
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,839
description and we're going to try to do
it like this

88
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:22,760
so this station that I'm trying to play
too is called the Swedish wraps at the

89
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,660
station

90
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:30,890
of course all stations do have
designated the names but there are cases

91
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:37,580
where e it gets a nickname by the tuna
to place it starts so let us try to

92
00:09:37,580 --> 00:10:14,210
imagine PVC 2am oh alright so that was
one of the station's video shop city it

93
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:19,250
is no longer active but many others are
we're going to mention now the

94
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,740
leadership culture also that was the
station which was located on the Cypress

95
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:33,230
it was mi6 station so British
intelligence it was mainly aimed at the

96
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:40,010
Middle East region of enough that there
are some incident of course the foreign

97
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,700
agencies to try to do
counterintelligence and one of the

98
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:49,400
measures is of course trying to gin the
stations and this lincolnshire portrait

99
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:55,699
was attempted to be James always by the
North Koreans so they transmitted on one

100
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:02,690
of the frequencies for some reasons I
know it wasn't destination obviously did

101
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:09,890
not have any connections to them but
maybe they thought the Eclipse so if you

102
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:15,860
want to hear those stations what you
need what kind of gears should together

103
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,740
to try to listen to those stations

104
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,570
well

105
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:27,070
fortunately enough you don't need to get
those this will other than that you can

106
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:32,590
have a regular or ham radio amateur
radio equipment and you can listen it

107
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:39,400
the broadcast thrown on a wide variety
of Spectre but mostly for example this

108
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:47,590
station can catch most of them so it is
very cheap compared to other radio

109
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:52,540
mature gear and for example imagine
somebody buying this it won't turn any

110
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,189
heads you know so if you're a spy you're
not suspicious because you kept the

111
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:07,030
station so it's basically all that you
need to start to that so logical

112
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:14,350
question is what do they trust me we
have anybody managed to record any of

113
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,630
the messages old enough

114
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:23,530
yes and as I mentioned there was that
incident with the Cuban spice which are

115
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:29,560
probably still in jail after the fair
trial in your heads of course so the

116
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,719
name of the group was 11 already obvious
but like bread wasp or something like

117
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,200
that so the numbering station his name
is Jung by a starting Kuhn that it it

118
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:50,410
uses the attencion board couple of times
so we have actually we don't know the

119
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:55,480
Crypt algorithm of that station we don't
know how it was encrypted how to encrypt

120
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:03,670
messages what we know from the trials
that spies is that they use the the data

121
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:08,469
received from the station and they had
customized software in their laptops so

122
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,130
they just type in the code that they
received from the station and it would

123
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:19,840
decrypt the message FBI busted them and
laptops were of course obtained and

124
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,000
probably NSA knows very well how that
crypto method worked

125
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
it is not of course the same for all of
them

126
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,840
we have a couple of notions on what they
transmitted actually so in the trials

127
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:46,570
three messages appeared so this is the
first i expect much more you know of

128
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,490
course nobody did

129
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,870
if except for max communist countries
even know that the international day of

130
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,070
woman exists so that was the first
message one of the messages the other

131
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:02,080
messages for example this does look like
he knows piping for everything like that

132
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,150
so characterized and continue to
strengthen fragile to join Dennis that

133
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,380
sounds sinister

134
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:14,980
also in this the this is like James Bond
movies so those are the three messages

135
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:21,850
that you know that are being transmitted
by definitely attencion station and to

136
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:29,140
mention messages ever put in public in
more than hundred of years of against

137
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,140
the existence of the numbers stations

138
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:47,510
so what kind of encryption does it use
of course it's probably symmetric-key we

139
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,470
don't know for sure

140
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,150
of course you don't know for sure what
kind of encryption does the Mossad use

141
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:58,910
or not Korea or mi6 but this is the most
probable scenario and the strongest

142
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:07,790
hypothesis on that one so no most
probably all the agents in the field get

143
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,770
what is called one-time pads

144
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:15,980
those are actually randomly generated
sequences of numbers or alphanumeric

145
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:24,320
characters or whatever predefined so
that it is not easy to ideally you don't

146
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,330
use the co2 crypt or generator for the
numbers you use the real entropy

147
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:38,600
so in essence in theory the usage of the
one-time pads in combination with known

148
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,870
symmetric algorithm is unbreakable

149
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:47,209
but there was a proof many years ago by
claude channel of that so if everything

150
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:55,520
is used correctly there is no way this
is eric and breakable of course attacks

151
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:02,329
are possible if operators or the agents
and field use it incorrectly or use a

152
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:09,589
couple of times or reuse the keys so
then it is possible in the bottom you

153
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:16,610
can see on the top that that image of
the top shows one of the actual one-time

154
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:25,279
pads used in Vietnam I think and on the
bottom is the sum system that year that

155
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:33,140
was used by one of the agents in that in
that biosphere with Cuba that i

156
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:39,770
mentioned so that those are extra things
so just mentioned we're just going to

157
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,810
mention the classification can not going
to

158
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:47,930
going to go deep enough so this
classification most widely used is by

159
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:52,880
that anymore 2000 which is European
number information gathering blah blah

160
00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:01,220
some stupid acronym so the prosecution
starts with the name of the language use

161
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,170
so it can be English Germans like other
languages or could we use more schools

162
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:15,110
of course early station to use most
Lords code entirely and nowadays we do

163
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:21,290
see the station using digital models
also polyphonic modes and who knows

164
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:30,830
maybe even steganography inside of that
nose so white survived so why the number

165
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:37,429
installations are still used because
they are treated efficient and they're

166
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,230
doing the job as a backup means of
communication so there's the bottom line

167
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,910
that does the closed system that i can
do you

168
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:52,070
so this is also one question with which
interested me

169
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,290
has anyone tried to write the
authorities to try to ask for what

170
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:04,909
what are those is those yours you know i
remember reading about one woman in UK

171
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:12,020
who heard the numbering station on her
FM radio because sometimes numbering

172
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:19,490
station do tend to skip frequencies and
use around the ones and you just

173
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:25,640
happened that it overlaps one of the BBC
frequencies and that woman actually

174
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,520
asked from the radio host she called the
BBC and over left that you know like

175
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,060
those are numbers on

176
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,429
I know snow flake numbers in something
like that you know like it was a meet

177
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:46,390
your he turned out the details probably
numbering station so the community did

178
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:52,510
try to contact the sum of the
government's and to try to see if

179
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:59,350
there's confirmation at least that there
are their stations so as you can see

180
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:06,490
there are mostly no replies but one
interesting thing is this this was the

181
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:11,320
one of the most beautiful thing that I
saw you know like we have a security

182
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:18,429
organization and I'd like to think that
there is a amateur radio operator then

183
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:24,700
in Czechoslovakia bank or track i know
it's 90 94 74 I don't see the number

184
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:31,270
correctly but this is secure cell card
from hampering station so how you know

185
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:36,850
they wrote like short where listeners
and they said there can be heard that

186
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:42,129
Oscar Mike station and they actually
wrote back and said that yourself cards

187
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,030
this priceless so we don't have a
confirmation that at least one station

188
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:52,510
is government we owned or it was because
it is to operate in nite nite b8

189
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:57,160
something like that so this is what they
also mentioned before

190
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:05,500
why it was it wasn't that until now and
as it seems it won't be for a long long

191
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:14,890
time so let's not mention this what we
have now in Vulcan today

192
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:20,950
this year we're going to hear our own
numbering station and it's going to be a

193
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:27,400
competition and the first three did
crack the message and get us the

194
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,260
plaintext are going to get the camera
demotion special edition

195
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,920
double-distilled

196
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,500
and the first played place gets three
liters second place two litters and

197
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:48,500
through placed one liter of ham radio
spirit so after this lecture quite a bit

198
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,880
lot after this lecture because i'm
waiting for my colleagues from amateur

199
00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:00,950
radio club train to arrive and we will
start the sorry we will start the

200
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:07,760
workshop because you need gear to to
receive the station so we made the kids

201
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,570
for you

202
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:15,919
they're free of charge you just come to
us and we will help you to just assembly

203
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,440
you just need to insert the elements
into soldier it that's it i do believe

204
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:29,390
it's 15 minutes of work max 11 hours
something like that so after after the

205
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,000
workshop is done

206
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,990
of course we can if you don't know to
call the solder and you want to compete

207
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:42,650
come to us and we'll assemble it for you
you know just promises that you will

208
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:48,530
learn how to solder up to the next next
belt backhoe and there is also a third

209
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:55,970
option which will be mentioned in the
workshop if those two are not option for

210
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:05,420
you so okay let's let the sea in a yeah
it's not it's not hard i didn't make it

211
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:11,150
too hard but it is interesting and it is
a little bit too challenging and if

212
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:16,310
nobody cracks it for a couple of hours
anyhow we are going to post the kids on

213
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:20,659
the page that you can see there are some
stickers on the walls with the Cure

214
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:27,410
coats and with text of this presentation
so are opposed the hints on that page

215
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:33,680
are regularly let's say but regular
starting from when we finish the

216
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:40,790
workshop it will be like it starts at
APM it finished finishes around 9pm say

217
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,799
something like that

218
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:46,869
and the numbering station star students
meeting every 15 minutes and in the

219
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:55,029
meantime it feels the void with some
represent eighties music so how it will

220
00:22:55,029 --> 00:23:00,940
just beat them up to the up to the end
of the balcony tomorrow and in the last

221
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:07,210
hour if nobody cracks the code which
will not happen i think because we are

222
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:12,970
going to post the kids and everything
just our before the ending everyone to

223
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:19,269
post the entire algorithm and the way to
decrypt the message so then it will be

224
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:25,090
if nobody they picked up to then it is
going to be erased you know just who

225
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:32,918
decreed the message first gets the boot
and all right so let's see your you're

226
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:36,039
going to have to build the receiver with
our help

227
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:43,029
it is not that hard we're going to be
right when you exit that door and up to

228
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:47,950
the right are going to be a couple of
tables and amateur radio club saying is

229
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,809
going to be there of course we can talk
about numbering stations and we can talk

230
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:57,399
about any ham radio related automatics

231
00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:03,039
so those are the prices and that

232
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:11,440
yeah those are actually from our from
Radio Club I and i said this at the

233
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,450
beginning but let me repeat we are
amateur radio club from running which is

234
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:22,869
city about 50 kilometers from not Assad
and we are welcoming of course all of

235
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:30,789
the intelligent and increased of people
and we hope that at least some of you

236
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:36,340
will maybe find interesting and start
going this all right

237
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:49,659
so thank you and I hope we will see at
the workshop at APM alright thank you

238
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:55,029
are going to check the questions and
sliding now and if anyone want to ask

239
00:24:55,029 --> 00:25:01,330
any question you can use this low-tech
Mike or you know he can ask me she can

240
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:06,789
ask me later on so anyone with me to
this Bible

241
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,800
with soup

242
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,800
just sick

243
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:28,280
alright so there is one question that
says what is an average length of the

244
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,070
message the only played sounded too
short

245
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:36,350
yes you're right I didn't want to bother
you with the full extent of the message

246
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:43,370
it is likely so one of the Russian spies
said that he actually had to receive the

247
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:48,350
message for one service station for one
hour and to decipher it

248
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:55,550
he had to do another two hours of manual
work so yes you're right this is quite

249
00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:01,340
short but it was this this was maybe ten
percent of the message and of course

250
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:09,230
those messages sir condensed meaning
that there's probably some code book

251
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:15,050
which excellent translate to some
context of the that they expect you know

252
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:22,490
like some coded messages like drug
cartels can use or whatever so even if

253
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:26,510
you decrypt the message to the plaintext
it doesn't mean that you're going to

254
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,370
know what is all about

255
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,699
yeah alright so i think that's the only
question yes

256
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:42,659
if when when the Mets when the message
is transmitted that to another country

257
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:48,809
for example isn't even the easy for that
county to block that message or ear and

258
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:55,289
corrupted well as I said North Korea
tried to jam the message for the

259
00:26:55,289 --> 00:27:00,119
lincolnshire poacher which was located
at $ADDRESSNUM cypress actually they

260
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:05,369
didn't succeed it is not easy to general
stations it is easy to gym one frequency

261
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:12,059
but the station's can easily switch to
another and they usually do have five or

262
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:17,849
six frequencies at they're just making
it so it is not easy task to do and it

263
00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:25,139
is costly because in order to gem have
stationed on the level of you know

264
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:30,988
country you're going to need the
powerful transmitters so it is a while

265
00:27:30,989 --> 00:27:32,429
it is possible

266
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:38,399
II it is not feasible thing to do it is
not it is not something that is usually

267
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,279
done it is not that easy

268
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,729
so thank you another question

269
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:48,690
any thoughts on the realtek
software-defined radio project because

270
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:53,940
we tip to listen to those transmissions
using that sorry can you repeat that I'd

271
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,379
any thoughts on the realtek
software-defined radio project because

272
00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:02,879
using that's reality behind five dollars
to listen those transmissions yeah yeah

273
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:08,519
sorry that's excellent question actually
you can use the web STR and listen to

274
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,469
the radio radio stations

275
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:16,320
sorry guys for that so you don't need to
buy any gear hardware from the start you

276
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,529
can use just it's it's a site called web
as they are like software-defined radio

277
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:27,329
and you can log in there and there are
radio station which can be control over

278
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:33,299
the web and you can tune in and listen
to the radio stations there are a number

279
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:40,049
of sites which go to enigma 2002 google
a little bit to their number of

280
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:42,658
communities which are tracking the

281
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:49,590
numbering stations so you do have the
actual expected transmission times i

282
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,418
will show you later on on the workshop
there is there is a page which tells you

283
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:59,429
which station are going to probably be
active in the next hour on the exact

284
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:05,340
date the teachers so you can easily
catch some of those they're like zeroes

285
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:12,299
of them so it's not like 5-10 and do we
have any idea how are these stations are

286
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:17,580
being controlled or something or how
they work they have passion inside or

287
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:25,049
they just emptiness that the remotely
controlled to how they work well there

288
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:31,710
is of course as the technology changed
over time the operations did change i

289
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:37,739
remember that there are some hypothesis
about some of the station in US which

290
00:29:37,739 --> 00:29:43,139
was on some military base and it was
just small concrete building with the

291
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:50,849
station side of it and mast antenna in
front and the guys from that time

292
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:56,970
hypothesis that it it was connected by
the phone line to Washington DC so the

293
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,039
message was generated at one place

294
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,720
who knows where and it was just
transmitted over the telephone pair

295
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:10,440
today transmission station they are
there are probably their most certainly

296
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,769
using some kind of a very complex
software to to generate the messages

297
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:23,279
today you know as we know that most
serious players do have them Russia cab

298
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:29,309
and the numbering stations us have the
number of stations Mossad and so those

299
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:32,350
guys do have a script or

300
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:37,750
academies so we can expect that this you
know fairly fairly kind

301
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,270
alright thank you again and seeing
workshop
