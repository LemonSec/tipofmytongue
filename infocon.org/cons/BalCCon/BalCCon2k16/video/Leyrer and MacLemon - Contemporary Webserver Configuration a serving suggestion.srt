1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:27,630
thank you for coming to welcome to case
16 hope you enjoying at the moment we're

2
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,879
gonna hear a lecture about contemporary
web server configuration so today's

3
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:41,160
applications are secure but they need to
be a sensible and module in their

4
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,059
configurations so Martin and make lemon
will talk about configuring aperture to

5
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,000
man to meet those configurations so if
you have any questions you can ask at

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,059
the end of the lectures and enjoy thank
you so much but if we're quick enough we

7
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:11,610
get to engine X as well so his case
McClement this is marching um yeah web

8
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,520
servers they talk a lot of protocols
these days are you all have heard of

9
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,450
those there's of course the gold HTTP
which started in 1991

10
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,500
is there somebody born after 91 in this
room you can be there is that ok so this

11
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,450
is history lesson for you i'm 90 91 in
the in the movie theaters there was the

12
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,939
addams family and silence of the lambs
if you still remember those of course

13
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:48,359
this was HTTP not . nine a little later
in 96 HTTP 1.1 followed was the first rc

14
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,090
an ietf specified version of it and and
that the moving the cinema respect then

15
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,759
was independent state the first one

16
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,970
trainspotting so yeah still use another
protocol that came out that year was

17
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:09,389
sslv3 and we're still using that one
writes yeah this is the the train

18
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,910
spotting party 15

19
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:16,609
and in 1991 we got HTTP 1.1 RFC 2616

20
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,340
yeah over hundred seventy pages so it
became much larger and try to fix a few

21
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,230
of the shortcomings of HTTP 1.1 some of
which worked some not so much

22
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,600
there wasn't moving in the cinemas back
then but we do not talk about since the

23
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,930
first rule is to not talk about that
movie and the second role is to not talk

24
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,790
about that movie and that's also was
some sort of stuff was fanfiction going

25
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,239
on in the city must be there and talk
about that as I don't ya but there was

26
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,150
also not up another protocol arm
released in $MONTH 1999 which was anyone

27
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:56,660
ideas this is an interactive talk sorry
for that but didn't want you and that's

28
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,920
probably we don't have any chocolate to
give away together is not here so it was

29
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,160
TLS 1.2 and yep

30
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:10,280
yes is that what's that old is that only
brought one interesting addition which

31
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,490
is serving a medication so you actually
could host multiple https websites on a

32
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,490
single IP with us one . back in 99

33
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,610
so why did we start with all the other
craft arm then of course there was t

34
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:34,190
less 1.1 are back in nineteen 2006 2006
sorry for me too i'm still tired from

35
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:40,370
rest of this party sorry for that I'm
someone perfect for cryptography was

36
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:46,340
added and some problems that were
introduced with 1.0 some sort of fixed

37
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,820
it sort of makes the other real fix came
in 2008 with TLS 1.2 which added

38
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:58,880
authenticated encryption with associated
data namely a sgm LOL account amount and

39
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,450
of course because some other parks
interior is 1.1 at this moment I'll is

40
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,950
1.2 is the only cryptographic le and
academically secure version we would

41
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:14,750
like to use and it's it's picking up so
recent pls reports from SL upset it's

42
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,950
around eighty percent of web servers now
supports us 1.2 so this is not wearing a

43
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:24,530
coat rack on that it things will get
interesting with TLS 1.3 that's that's

44
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,390
going to be a lot of fun in the next
year

45
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:33,380
yeah but back-to-back from cryptography
to the more basic HTTP protocol of

46
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:39,650
course of a few problems of HTTP so
Google in 2009 I'm went on a limb and

47
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:47,179
upper introduced to speedy protocol arm
to fix a few of those HTTP our issues

48
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,960
are making make the web faster basically
yeah

49
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,830
who will try to run on their own and and
skip ietf for a moment implemented

50
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,840
speedy in the Chrome browser sweet and
other browser vendors follow suit and

51
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,909
implement that protocol as well

52
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,330
main differences are that speed is a
binary protocol another text based

53
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,650
protocol anymore and this brought a lot
of speed and is also the planet

54
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,479
acclaimed to work in an HTTP 1.1
actually worked in speed for the first

55
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:23,539
time in more or less an important speedy
was based on HTTPS meaning meaning you

56
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:27,710
could only use it with TLS and what
mandatory and this was the first time

57
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:33,169
they actually managed to get a https
sites be faster than plain text HTTP it

58
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:38,599
was a very interesting observation for
many of us of course some skipping ietf

59
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:45,289
on the internet is not the best idea and
ietf took over in 2012 and based on

60
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:51,320
speedy to they started the specification
for HTTP to so basically wherever you

61
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,520
see speedo right now it's in the face of
it it's facing out

62
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,700
it's getting deprecated so http/2 is
actually the way to go armed are

63
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,520
actually deep and a lot of stuff that
didn't work

64
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,200
HTTP actually works with HTTP two so we
have had a compression her head of

65
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,099
handling is a lot better armed the
encryption part that didn't take over

66
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:17,810
from speedy so in in speeding to speak
as asthma Clemens said the speed of our

67
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,600
speedy are required

68
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:27,680
encryption with HTTP to encryption is
sort of optional I'm the only the only

69
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,020
client let's call it that the only
client that supports HTTP through our

70
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,609
through an unencrypted HD but for an
encrypted connection is called 40

71
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:43,370
particular purposes all other all other
implementations require encryption

72
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,780
encryption in theory you gotta respect
that says http/2 without encryption is

73
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,710
possible but nobody into implements it
so in reality you have to use TLS which

74
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,239
is a good thing I think arm and we had a
compression of course p had some

75
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,490
problems using gcp there

76
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:03,050
this was fixed by using a special
hatchback compression algorithm in heb

77
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:09,950
to which knows about headers and can our
knows about sensitive photos like

78
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,760
cookies and it won't compress cookie
header so we're not running into

79
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,670
problems with leaking data about cookies
they're elsewhere

80
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:25,160
yeah I'm so HD people now is implemented
in all major browsers we got support in

81
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:32,150
firefox are from version 36 on google
chrome or 40 started supporting HTTP 279

82
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,909
surprisingly uh supported it and even
are even Microsoft Windows 10 and

83
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:43,850
internet explorer supported by now so
yeah if you're in a reasonably updated

84
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:49,370
browser version your browser already
does support HTTP two are so so so

85
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,810
Andrew and we will show you later on how
to enable HTTP to us in the server side

86
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:59,660
so basically you can turn it on and will
probably work for most of your users are

87
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:06,290
of course why should implement modern
TLS and heb to on your website of course

88
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:10,220
either you have a completely completely
new site and please start developing

89
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,140
with https from the start and http/2
will save a lot of work in in the

90
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,300
migration process afterwards if you have
a HTTP web site that's already life and

91
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,680
you want to go to https an HTTP to you
probably have a lot of work in front of

92
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,240
you mean it's it's exciting it's
manageable we have the actual example of

93
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,450
the major Australian new site that

94
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:37,820
did the migration within i think one or
two weeks that the the heart

95
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,020
hot cold a technical stuff and then our
testing it and rolling it out so it's

96
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,880
not that it's not a month long project
it's probably faster and finishing an

97
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,880
airport in in brownie or something like
that

98
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,650
yeah I'm so actually the technical
implementation is usually pretty fast it

99
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,310
may take you one and a half years to
convince management that's the

100
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,349
transcript and if it's on your side
that's yeah and this also works with

101
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,490
governmental IT but pages there it takes
even longer but it works you can you can

102
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,960
actually get through those points of
course if your website already supports

103
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:17,990
https or even https only just switch it
on and you're currently i'm likely that

104
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,510
you have any drawbacks from a tree too

105
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:25,460
so what are your motivations to run
through https and and implement http/2

106
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:33,560
well 2016 should be enough but also of
course there's a lot of stuff going on

107
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,560
and on the client process that come in
there's still a few seats left

108
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,189
well you always hear the floor

109
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:46,340
I'm so a lot of browser browser
manufacturers are actually closing down

110
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:53,060
a pixs through for HTTP connection
Sophie if you access a website for HTTP

111
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,489
you won't get our JavaScript camera
access or anything else that Charles own

112
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,020
microphone gyroscope meaning location
and positioning data will be locked down

113
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:08,900
and this is going to get more and more
in our chrome if you're on the chrome

114
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:14,600
canary 55 version for testing purposes
that will actually call out an HTTP

115
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,510
plaintext connection with a big red not
secure label so if you're not on HTTPS

116
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:25,819
yet you might want to go ahead and and
you probably want to do that till the

117
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,780
end of the year but they said that Lamar
with the with the normal version of

118
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,699
Chrome are beginning of next year or
beginning of next year for HTTP side the

119
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,450
chrome will tell you this is an insecure
side and to use and you will get a lot

120
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,000
of tickets and use a call so we don't
want that

121
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,870
yeah

122
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,830
of course there's other interesting
things going on the internet with plain

123
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:52,250
text connections you can easily
manipulate them inject advertising and

124
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,180
other funny things some websites
actually come with a lot of advertising

125
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,189
and tracking stuff already

126
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,540
so we built by what the authors that
that's the stuff the the the website

127
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:08,120
make us actually edit on purpose so that
would be did the good ads yes that

128
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,190
that's 14 trackers on a single website
with San Francisco gate you have heard

129
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,210
of it or you haven't

130
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:19,400
it doesn't matter it's 14 trackers if
you're on an interesting isp connection

131
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:25,130
but probably not they're only business
model is being intimate / own ISP and

132
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,540
providing internet connection you might
end up with some more tracker so it's 65

133
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,760
trackers on the lever somebody else is
making business on your website now and

134
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:41,330
probably tracking users in ways you
maybe don't like that and they can of

135
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,150
course manipulate your website in any
way they like

136
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,470
of course they're always the argument
with HTTPS is so slow and it makes my

137
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,790
page to page looks lower and my
raspberry pi service actually getting

138
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,510
getting overwhelmed with the traffic and
ever have to buy a second pie or have to

139
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,540
upgrade to the newest version and I
don't want to do that

140
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:05,480
there's also a document for that on
HTTPS with HTTP two is actually really

141
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,110
measurably faster than a plain text
connection of course you have the

142
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,970
initial delay for TLS handshake but
everything else beyond that point

143
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,020
especially if you're on a high latency
connection like a gsm connection or

144
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,100
satellite link your mobile phone users
will love you for switching on HTTP to

145
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,810
because every subsequent call and
especially if you're running hxc heavy

146
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,099
connections with a lot of requests going
back and forth your site will really

147
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,630
benefit from HTTP do so it will get
faster and with working with with

148
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,830
contemporary hardware or all the
encryption stuff is done by hardware so

149
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,839
it's it's not really a performance issue
anymore so how do you how to use other

150
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,640
publishers part of implementing our
proper proper configuration well use a

151
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,769
famous austria band from the seventies
and eighties say the school

152
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:57,149
and of course you gotta capture what is
already life on your site's you surely

153
00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:02,040
have heard of sls . com you know
somebody who has not yet heard of slf so

154
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,118
complicated

155
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:07,350
good you have not heard of it okay i'll
give you a really brief wrap-up of what

156
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,389
this site is for you go to SL XCOM you
enter the URL of your website this is

157
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:16,949
actually the Clarion Cambria it recently
visited awesome event you should go

158
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:22,410
there are just let it test it runs for a
minute or two and we give your report

159
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,910
this is the executive summary part
printed out printed on the laser

160
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,939
printers put it in front of the of the
senior stuff

161
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:34,469
yeah preferably in color is everything
screen that is fine you'll get a race

162
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,429
you get out of additional information to
get all the cipher suite to get all the

163
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:41,970
handshake information protocol
information all the things you want to

164
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,829
know about about the chart so this is
the executive summary if management does

165
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:50,488
understand it so will your customers and
users it would probably have to to

166
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:55,889
improve to explain to them that this is
the American School radeon us in your

167
00:13:55,889 --> 00:14:00,809
own UK English you know it's like grapes
from A to F of course you get a lot of

168
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:04,529
information about the certificate
information revocation status which of

169
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:05,699
course does not work

170
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:09,959
um the whole certificate chain is
displayed or if there are any issues

171
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:14,758
with the chain like unsorted
certificates or getting the wrong way

172
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:20,369
for the protocol support with telus
versions that you support there's the

173
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:25,589
very simple to remember pls traffic
light we use and you should be on TLS

174
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:31,529
1.2 these days of course on with TLS 1.3
upcoming probably early next year

175
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:32,429
already

176
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:39,509
Sheila's one . 101 . oh please only use
them for your legacy down backward

177
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:47,879
compatibility and if anything's says SL
version something skip it turning off in

178
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:55,709
1996 where sslv3 came out the Austrian
hit parade charges not worldwide i think

179
00:14:55,709 --> 00:15:00,089
it was worldwide it was lost delivery
with macrina and you probably don't want

180
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:02,110
to do the Macarena on your web server
anymore

181
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,959
and the other ones are not a lot better
it's member number 5 wish you were here

182
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:16,570
yeah so TLS 1.2 that was all summer long
from pitt rock that probably better and

183
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:22,360
you can you run Republic recognizes that
okay the important stuff on the cipher

184
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,860
suites your website supports course your
web server should enforce these ciphers

185
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,930
we cannot let the client pick something
you get a very handy connection

186
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,310
handshake simulation which tells you all
this old browser will not be able to

187
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:41,290
connect anymore my windows 95 with
internet explorer 55 can't connect to my

188
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:41,680
website

189
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,599
oh my god yeah it's probably better that
way so if there's a red lines in this

190
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,190
client cannot handshake is probably for
the better and of course there are no

191
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,120
java browser so it doesn't matter if
machine-to-machine that might be a

192
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,410
different story you have to look into
that but that gets into java territory

193
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,050
and they don't go don't go no huh

194
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:07,149
nothing good happens there no of course
40 LSU need LPN or npn extensions to TLS

195
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:15,579
we need a fairly recent openssl version
102 or dsl is also fine arm and you get

196
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:19,750
other nice thing is they are highlighted
in green on the underreport if the green

197
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:25,480
things are good arm that's fine and if
you leak some metadata about your pls

198
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,449
version about your openness is l ancient
release PHP Perl something of course we

199
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,589
have turned that off the nice

200
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:36,940
the nice thing about the the the side is
that it not only works on one on one

201
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,199
server but it also works on honor on the
whole cluster of servers and gives you a

202
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,579
report on all members of the cluster so
this is this is and if even if there's

203
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:50,380
several names and several like if I p
addresses and and legacy IP addresses

204
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,390
will handle that for you

205
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,689
yeah and this shows you have a
consistent configuration across your

206
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,800
service and across the protocols of
course this does not have to be the same

207
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,699
as well so this is also a consistent
server configuration across the whole

208
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:07,530
clusters of consistencies good with the
DRS

209
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:12,420
this is the whole clusterfuck they have
actually improved so we've gone to a

210
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,170
consistent be by now there's room for
improvement of course what would be the

211
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:21,750
worst report results you could get your
friends any ideas what could be the

212
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:31,530
worst thing you can shout in letters huf
itself okay any anything works you can

213
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:37,620
imagine thing to think outside the box
thinking playing tag now that getting

214
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,620
closer there's no p value but getting
closer

215
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:46,740
yeah no such socket on 43 t know that's
actually something worse than T yeah

216
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,160
yeah this is like oh sorry

217
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:57,510
https ports closed there is no secure
website and to be honest I'm openbsd

218
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:02,460
they had to implement TLS on the httpd
on their on their own web server and

219
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,320
since they're really good at dogfooding
their own stuff they did this and the

220
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,810
data good job by now so kudos today

221
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,100
openbsd project they have a fundraiser
at the moment so if you use something

222
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,379
from openbsd like ssh go and donate or
have some company to a donation we

223
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,910
really need the open-ended and i will be
talking sh on sunday

224
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:29,310
yeah of course um we already heard the
tea which is a trust issue that just

225
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:35,970
means the checker can validate your your
certificate

226
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:42,930
this is from an Austrian governmental
server with trust issues good group of

227
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,140
course you might not trust your own
government for good reasons

228
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,440
there's also other warnings you might
get so if your report looks like this

229
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,060
you should you should take a closer look
should take a closer look horse in this

230
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,909
race it was expired certificate

231
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:00,150
yeah and expired certificate that had
been expired for over seven years

232
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,639
details details details you can
extrapolate the patch level of that

233
00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:10,678
machine from there of course that been
interesting but not so if you have this

234
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,779
really bad things on your configuration
you'll get a really noticeable red line

235
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:20,759
in the report so this helps to find out
what you need to fix so in order to get

236
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:26,429
a proper secure web server setup arm you
want you want to check your TLS setup

237
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:30,240
you set the tls configuration we will
show you in a minute or two

238
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,789
how to do that anything any any any any
any additional ideas on what you should

239
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:39,990
do in order to secure your web server
setup apart from hardening the Machine

240
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:44,250
and the usual stuff and using to UFC
less apart from using Tillis

241
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:49,649
whatwhat shutting down valid yeah valid
option i think it's shutting down your

242
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:54,120
marketing might not like that solution
quick and we will start with the mail

243
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:02,729
service first and the web servers come
after that but like yeah that's young

244
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:07,080
more into the content area result
without medical care about content but

245
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,080
just let just managing the service loan

246
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:17,518
yeah yeah yeahs not they're using
version numbers up you know that you're

247
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,549
nothing major Harding start of course
that's a good thing

248
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:24,570
remove everything you don't need i'm
plugging yeah shutting it down

249
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:34,700
if you got the money because you like it

250
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:44,120
heard of these was HTTP response headers
some service deliver them so we heard

251
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,989
yeah sometimes the headers these days
are more than the actual payload of your

252
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:54,560
1 pixel transparent tracking gif by a
factor of like 20 and they're delivered

253
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:02,899
with every response this year so she be
stopping this is like yeah yeah yeah

254
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,290
exactly where we'll get into that
territory you're in a good track

255
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm glad you haven't fallen asleep yet
so there's a bunch of security relevant

256
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,400
HTTP headers you can tell your web
server sent which of course requires

257
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,300
your browser to understand and implement
them correctly but if you don't send

258
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,870
them there's no transfer the prostitute
to actually help improve your security

259
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:28,189
yeah so if you already know s elapsed
parecer security hairs that I all which

260
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,840
looks strangely familiar you just enter
the website to click on test you get any

261
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,439
ports you get a report there's a
difference between testing HTTP and

262
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,210
https here because you might redirect
and upgrade your clients to a secure

263
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,000
connection which you of course you do

264
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,020
this tells me okay this is redirecting
nothing to see here there's no header

265
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,610
set on the HTTP connection you could do
that and you'll end up with a quite

266
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:58,610
nicely implemented better setup here on
there's a few headers you can set on

267
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:07,070
HTTP and https it's those three are that
some extreme options content type

268
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:13,129
options and the egg access protection at
these are all settings you can correct

269
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:18,410
me if I'm wrong but this you can all set
without breaking arm or shooting

270
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:24,200
yourself in the foot too badly their
future a few options we will get into

271
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,370
little bit later on but these are
basically safe arm with extreme options

272
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,750
you basically tell the browser how to
handle iframes and stuff with most

273
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:38,930
websites you can basically say deny our
with some applications you can tell it

274
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,149
to go so it same origin so it only

275
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:46,699
hi friends from your own server and with
the other ones contact with content type

276
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,070
your basic eight-armed tell the browser

277
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:56,089
don't try to interpret a to check if I'm
sending a mime header of CPAC I don't

278
00:22:56,089 --> 00:23:00,950
try to to check out if there's actually
javascript delivered and execute that

279
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,359
JavaScript don't do that

280
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:06,859
so tell the browser to know sniff are
because some browsers are really curious

281
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:11,718
about what they get descended and jpeg
pictures you send it a pic mimetype the

282
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:15,320
browser says well this is JavaScript and
I can do javascript and i'll run it no

283
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:21,408
it isn't often army good i'm so the
browser just outsmarted itself and you

284
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:26,419
had a successful attack on that website
and on that user if you tell it to know

285
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:31,129
sniff it will not sniff glue that your
browser sense and with the cross-site

286
00:23:31,129 --> 00:23:34,218
scripting protection some browsers
actually do that

287
00:23:34,219 --> 00:23:38,899
namely internet explorer chrome and
safari which is unexpected what does

288
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:39,468
that happen

289
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:43,249
yes of course there's no see defaults on
the interwebs and you have to actually

290
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:47,779
tell it to block cross-site scripting
attacks with around detection works more

291
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:48,739
or less

292
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:55,999
they're so not a lot of potential to to
get any side effects of course you get

293
00:23:55,999 --> 00:24:00,710
from that report all the headers your
website sense with all the server stuff

294
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:05,539
leaking information and also a lot of
information what these headers actually

295
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:11,539
mean what they can be used for and what
well you are possible to use and of

296
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:16,070
course if if your system administrator
you don't usually don't want to use one

297
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:21,019
of those fancy GUI browser thing is and
and all that colorful stuff and and and

298
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:27,710
and and so on so arm before we get into
our are not leaving the comfort of your

299
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,239
terminal huh

300
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:34,009
there's others that you can use on most
people and he moved to move the slides

301
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:36,169
around sorry don't tell anyone

302
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:39,830
of course there's the rather complex
thing is called content security policy

303
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:44,809
where your web server can tell the
browser where to load content from and

304
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:49,940
where not to do with that that thing
actually gives you enough rope to shoot

305
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,310
yourself into the foot and if you didn't
know rope could

306
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:57,590
that you should have read the man page
it's awesome to implement content

307
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:02,750
security policy but it needs a lot of
testing so and if if you don't like it

308
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:08,690
develops you just turn it on its panty
to see marketing find out that their

309
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:13,520
remotely loaded google javascript
analytics thing has not been working for

310
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,680
six months or that the phone suddenly
don't don't render and and the webpage

311
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,550
actually is pretty pretty blank because
they forgot about a font fall back in

312
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:27,590
your in deciding a lot of fun to be had
something security policy and they can

313
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,709
be a little tedious to generate so
there's a convenient generator for that

314
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:35,930
you just click together what you like to
have and you'll get a nice string that

315
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,260
you can copy paste into your web server
configuration but actually something but

316
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,520
please please please

317
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,060
to test this thing before you turn it
into production that you don't want your

318
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,929
customers to to open it taken tell you
this is not working you want to and

319
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:51,680
check this the slides will be online
after afterwards so if if you don't

320
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,850
catch one of the URLs they'd all be in
this life as they will be with text copy

321
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,949
paste if you don't need anywhere else

322
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:03,110
there's other security relevant headers
you can set these only work on https

323
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:07,760
websites the other ones work on HTTP as
well as across the HTTP strict Transport

324
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,010
Security which tells the browser

325
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:15,230
oh you're here with a secure connection
please don't use anything else come back

326
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:20,030
with a secure connection for this amount
of seconds in the future and if you

327
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:24,139
really know what you're doing you can
set your website to preload hsps which

328
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,240
means there's a heart coded compiled in
list in your browser that tells the

329
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,360
browser always use https on this web
sites and if the user explicitly types

330
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,129
HTTP colon slash slash rewrite it to
https before sending the request or

331
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:45,680
you're already protected from the first
request a browser makes for your site to

332
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,510
think about submitting your your URL to
that list if it's on that list

333
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:56,120
it's not impossible but it's really
really really hard together after has a

334
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:01,729
process to get your website your whole
domain including all subdomains and host

335
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:04,100
you have probably only for internal use
that

336
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,149
don't use certificates there's a way to
get it off the list again

337
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,140
it involves submitting your list and
answering a few questions to some google

338
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:16,429
executives and also having a few hundred
million users update the browser to get

339
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:20,510
the new list which I don't see what your
sweetheart is the problem but yeah it's

340
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,740
hard to get off that lest you forget
about it if you're on HD HD s preload

341
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,910
you'll never get that back and of course
there's the other options

342
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:36,080
HTTP public keeping that's even more
interesting and yeah

343
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,700
public opinion means you tell the web
server tells the browser

344
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,679
these are the certificates you can
expect to see on that website and if you

345
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,840
find anything else even if it's a valid
certificate on by some governmental

346
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,370
authority

347
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,969
please don't connect and tell the user
there's also no way to click through a

348
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,169
connection there's no I know this I know
it's insecure yeah pls advanced

349
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:01,970
confirmed this exception

350
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:06,320
you won't get that button your users
will not be able to connect to that side

351
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,200
anymore with and public opinion you can
actually cryptographically take down

352
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,100
your domain if you do it wrong if you
don't have proper key management in

353
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,850
place

354
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:24,740
this can really go badly so it's
interesting for high security sites to

355
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,580
do this but please test test test in
advance before going that route

356
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,699
maybe with a domain that's not that
sensitive not really your main

357
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,510
protection domain maybe and think about
hosts that are not exposed to the

358
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:40,879
internet that would require a valid
certificates from that point on as well

359
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,299
I'm test servers and there's of course a
nice generator for your public key

360
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:48,530
painting stuff

361
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:53,000
it's a simple shell script by hundred
work also does the SLS newsletter by now

362
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,610
and i'm just still a lot of interesting
TLS stuff now we come to the part where

363
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,870
you can test from the terminal so we got
a call of course

364
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:09,590
works with IP and legacy IP so give just
give it just get the URL and you get the

365
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:13,730
headers and and all the information you
wanted you know of course if you prefer

366
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:20,419
the new user and over the PSD want us w
get a little bit more expressive syntax

367
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:25,400
but get you the same results not in not
as nice as call it still works quite

368
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,090
fine

369
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,959
yeah of course there's a lot of other
testing options available and there's

370
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,899
height bridge that's it won't give you a
lot more details about their TLS set up

371
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:39,678
on on your web server but if you're in
the banking industry and you have to

372
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:45,470
comply with pci DSS this will give you a
nice report looking rather similar to

373
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,940
the ones we've seen before so if you
need to be compliant with some things

374
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,830
like these are you get the details if
you're following pci compliance in the

375
00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:00,049
current version of course i'm also are
that we talked about the service of

376
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:04,129
course there's a TLS configuration and
turn and stuff like that in the browser

377
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:08,450
so you want maybe want to check the
process settings there's also test for

378
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:13,100
slm from SL eps that will show you the
configuration what your browser actually

379
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,730
accepting in regards to Cyprus and an
encryption stuff like that

380
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:22,909
including a speedy and HTTP d2
configuration and of course you can look

381
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:27,710
into the configuration of each browser
so for firefox just about conflict that

382
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:32,120
will tell you two things of course you
can change stuff in there and you want

383
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,709
to make sure that you're not changing
something that breaks actually breaks a

384
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,149
lot of stuff

385
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:42,739
same height same goes for chromium and
for the Apple bolts

386
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:48,860
yeah everyone knows best was broken for
you so they don't let you change it so

387
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,020
we we got about nine minutes left

388
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:57,440
order for the interesting part on web
server configurations are please take

389
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,360
care of your back-end servers arm if you
need two LS recommendations and conflict

390
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,899
snippets that you can pretty much
copy/paste you may have heard of a

391
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:11,029
better grip the Lord project on that
does not only do web servers but also

392
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:16,340
VPN email and tons of other server
things and keeps your crypto her

393
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,418
getting recommendations for that we're
working on an update which takes into

394
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:25,909
account pls 1.3 and other stuff course
they have they have basically copy paste

395
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:30,380
ready samples of configuration with
saying defaults just think about you

396
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,820
user base maybe they had their still an
old old versions of an operating system

397
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:40,129
with all browsers so always test before
before rolling out into production that

398
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:45,380
guide of course is it's open source it's
free it's libre it's curtis are so you

399
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,100
can check out every commit to that
document that has ever been made from

400
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,789
the first blank documents and and if you
have experience with one of the more

401
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:58,039
exotic server variants maybe you can
even submit the configuration sample

402
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:01,399
they're taking in more requests your
requests

403
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:06,110
oh so now coming to your favorite web
server attacking its you're different

404
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,010
now it's not my favorite

405
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,010
I have to work with it so so we're
talking about

406
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:14,360
on one hand on apache that yet

407
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:23,870
okay just just a character that are so
Apache currently 22.4 23 now think that

408
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:28,489
that changed now too . force is the
usual thing one important note about the

409
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:35,450
HR HTTP server project if you're
installing apache on windows 95 98 m e

410
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:39,500
or NT 4.0 please stop now

411
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:45,409
thank you this is verbatim from the
Mozilla documentation for Apache

412
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:48,110
configuration yeppity-do sorry that you

413
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:54,559
yeah so in order in order to implement
els and the security headers we talked

414
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,960
about you need to model model additional
modules you need armada SL and more

415
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,649
together

416
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:05,658
yes it's still cut monticello although
we are using TLS and SL anymore

417
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:08,050
get used to it it won't change

418
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:13,330
any in in the near future or even the
far future probably I'm additionally if

419
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:20,649
you want to use Arm http/2 that's also
not H to enable that and arm

420
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:26,320
you should have HTTP to support within
the patches also if you really want to

421
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,480
there's a speedy for all the versions of
Apache but as is as speed is deprecated

422
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:41,350
basically deprecated stay with the boat
h 2so arm in Apache as we know it is a

423
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:47,500
little bit more readable not so bad
color as we said when you get there you

424
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,730
get the slides are you have to enable
our the ports are patches has to listen

425
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:58,720
to arm and a lot of other stuff that
engine X which will take a look a little

426
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,120
bit later on arm actually do this for
you and then for each virtual host that

427
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:09,580
you actually want to cover you have to
give you have to turn SL engine on give

428
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:16,569
it a certificate file probably from lets
you create let's encrypt and yet you

429
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:21,790
disable you disable the SL to an ssl
version free

430
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:26,590
we probably can get away with the
sailing till is 1.0 by now

431
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:32,500
yeah yeah especially over for our web
host where you know your clients like an

432
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,250
internet site that is connected from the
from the internet but you know your

433
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,150
clients are on the current version you
can just go to this one . to buy now and

434
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:46,030
the CSL cipher suite that is a given
here is actually a one-to-one copy from

435
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:50,410
the better grip dog project so that
usually works with all the available

436
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:57,399
browsers are and of course are we want
we want to foreign force decipher order

437
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,390
be implemented on the server we want to
turn this L compression off otherwise

438
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:10,569
we'll get a lot of bad rating and at sls
calm and there's of course the thtr if

439
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,910
you have my firm handshake thingy

440
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:20,109
I'm for all the Apache versions are you
have to explicitly named it with you new

441
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,590
version it will also select magic age
promoter spots

442
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:30,100
yeah yeah you still have tht ciphers are
out faced by many browsers so chrome 53

443
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,990
I think already completely disable dhcp
cipher suite so you can only use

444
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:39,009
elliptic curve diffie-hellman for
Merrill anymore so if you're still in

445
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:44,380
openssl 498 that will be interesting
because they want to have any matching

446
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,100
cyprus anymore and rescue rc4 but don't
do that

447
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:55,779
I'm the security has a little bit easier
arm are the statistics is the normal arm

448
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,810
Apache service intex arm

449
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:04,060
we won't go into the details so you can
basically take a look it up in the in

450
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,230
the slides afterwards

451
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,260
you've already seen the headers it's
just the same just with an apache conf

452
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:14,380
line here and the same goes for CSP and
extremely

453
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:20,020
all the artists I'm for redirecting a
episode not redirecting that's upgrading

454
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:25,330
upgrading your client connections from
HTTP to HTTPS arm you basically want to

455
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:32,380
send 31 our error know the gin Rickey
return to your browser's you have two

456
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,910
options you can either use mod rewrite
our model is with the Apache i'm

457
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,190
basically both are doing the same thing

458
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,730
performance-wise that's not much of a
difference if you're using mod rewrite

459
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:46,960
for other stuff just do it that way if
if you're not using what we write take

460
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,830
much

461
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:53,020
Elias of course of what we also had was
the server tokens so we don't want we

462
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:58,690
want to hide the actual server versions
and are powered by PHP stuff and all the

463
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:03,610
all the other things so if we want to
turn it off arm and if your friend of a

464
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:09,370
friend of terry pratchett you also maybe
want to add the flex over her head us

465
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:14,410
for terry pratchett which will bring
which will bring us

466
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:20,649
r2d2 the other animal server the one
other web server yeah all the interested

467
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:25,300
in room now hate us for turning of the
server tokens causes of intelligence for

468
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,080
them

469
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:31,810
yeah engine X so 110 . 3 is the stable
and won 11-3 is the main line version

470
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:37,240
but you can get within the next segment
three minutes okay that works

471
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,700
you can enable the HTTP ssl module same
goes here its course we're using TLS

472
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:48,100
it's a compile-time option I with nginx
you got the HTTP to module with which

473
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:52,180
deprecates the speedy module so you can
use both unless you zap retired a patch

474
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:57,160
by cloudflare and since some of you may
beat or users we won't use anything from

475
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,750
club for they want you to let us use it
anyway um with the server connector

476
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,860
configuration it looks a lot like like
the Apache one that's if you're familiar

477
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,820
with engine X configuration it's really
easy with the SL protocols you have to

478
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,740
explicitly enable them instead of
turning off the ones you don't like arm

479
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,640
for the cipher suites in the sublet just
works the same you need a certificate

480
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:24,650
and to get HTTP to you just enter http/2
as a

481
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:28,099
a verb in the listen directive and you
will get HTTP to support

482
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:36,260
um of course we prefer the cipher server
to cipher suites to be given by the

483
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:41,150
server and not let the client pick
something and engineers also gives you

484
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:45,500
way too sore to select if you haven't
parameters if you don't want to go with

485
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,690
the standard that probably has been pre
computed by some agency already and with

486
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:56,210
internets you also get a way of
selecting the elliptic curve preference

487
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:00,890
um there's only two you can actually use
which are implemented by our clients and

488
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:06,890
you've got the the speed speed speed
tech speed offer prefer to speak further

489
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:07,910
to buffer size

490
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:13,368
oh yeah I'm buffersize that's something
that's only statically possible but that

491
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:17,690
gives you reduce time to first byte so
your website will respond a little

492
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:23,750
faster if you reduce the buffer size are
here to 4k there should be in an

493
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:28,039
upcoming version a dynamic way to size
that window which gives you even more

494
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:31,490
speed as far as security headers you
have already seen and heard about them

495
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:36,589
you can just add them with strict
Transport Security and public keep

496
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:41,869
painting and for HTTP of course as well
you can use the content security policy

497
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:48,200
and the x-ray mex content-type and
excess policy headers there's other

498
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,430
headers you could look into if you know
your website uses has a lot of internet

499
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:56,960
explorer Heather's there's a bunch of X
headers you can you can set um just

500
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,490
check out if there's more that your
specific website or user base can

501
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:07,970
benefit from of course we upgrade to
https we send a 301 redirect just as

502
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:08,990
simple as that

503
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,399
when redirecting please don't redirect
the user from the hostname to

504
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:20,839
www.ghcf.org and then back to https
without the w you'll get four or five

505
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:24,920
unnecessary redirect we can cost a lot
of time on a mobile connection don't do

506
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,619
that with the server tokens you can turn
them off with engine X as well as

507
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:34,609
associated with the light paper works
just as well turn off the lights for the

508
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:37,370
word for the pen testers so we don't
know which version you're running

509
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:44,390
and of course Terry Terry Pratchett is
well come on engine X as well so think

510
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:49,520
about the headers it's not the only
thing you can do they will not cover

511
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,630
your pen testing of your actual web
application you can perfectly do a

512
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:58,970
super-secure SQL injection if your back
and reflect something that's so possible

513
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:04,220
and if you're interested in web
applications they cannot make your good

514
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:09,290
TLS setup course modsecurity for
actually and engine X and Maxie for

515
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:14,570
engine X only with the slight downside
that this is not fully compatible with

516
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:20,750
HTTP to at this moment it's been worked
on so in the near future you you should

517
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:27,860
be able to use that so remember if your
sls report keeps you an F your setup is

518
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:33,080
on fire and you have to fix it is easy
to remember if there's something red

519
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:38,000
work on it so everything less than an
eighth grade is not acceptable anymore

520
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:44,630
keep in mind starting 2017 browsers will
actually call out non https websites

521
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:50,210
with a big red not secure banner and you
don't want to be on that list from which

522
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:56,270
leaves us three and a half minutes for
questions and we'll have a volunteer

523
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:01,340
running around with a microphone so
raise your hand if you're confident this

524
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,950
is photostream to record a letter
warning you

525
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,009
ya know

526
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:13,640
oh cool with this with you yeah hello i
was wondering about endings

527
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:19,220
yeah about the grace of grating there
https if there is if there's any

528
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,779
difference between sending a three or
one or a right which is actually 302 i

529
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:29,480
think a real one is a permanent redirect
in 302 was a temporary redirect their

530
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,620
indifference on the security side or on
the performance side on on the

531
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,940
performance side 301 will actually be
remembered by the browser for the

532
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,980
session so if you backtrack and go
forward again it will remember the the

533
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,480
301 and not actually do the request and
replace it before actually making those

534
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,860
that request that is a tiny round

535
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:54,240
round tripper performance game was real
to you gotta read evaluation of that

536
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,129
redirect every time and also helps with
Google indexing and cos there's no

537
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:04,050
security implications that i am aware of
so just a tiny performance issue and

538
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:09,420
saving a few round trips anymore
questions isn't on the dark side haha

539
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,560
I'm to the beautiful weather like where
you go medically speaking

540
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:21,930
so as I know let's encrypt the script
creates automatically HTTP setup for a

541
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:28,799
pipe Apache should we trust a tour we
should have a look up on what's

542
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,740
generated after we set up the
certificates i personally would not

543
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,930
trust any software that starts rewriting
my apache or other configurations just

544
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:44,399
out of principle my personal
recommendation would be to your own

545
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:51,990
setup and use one of the many HTTP acne
implementations that are available for

546
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:56,160
further let's encrypt like let's encrypt
that Sh which you can find on get up or

547
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,810
there's Acme Acme of shi think so

548
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,320
the the origin official let's encrypt
pison client is a little strange in my

549
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,160
regard

550
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,680
there's a lot of other really well
working implementation so um think about

551
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,819
your LS configuration and her set up for
yourself and adapted to your personal

552
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:22,560
needs for your site and use one of the
very many options to have the Refresh of

553
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,580
the certificates automate that really
works well i'm using them and and in

554
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,810
regards to configuration and you should
always understand what you either

555
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:35,610
generate let somebody else generate or
copy from from our website from

556
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:39,360
somewhere else you have to understand
what it's what it's doing before you

557
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,260
before you paste it into the web server
especially for scripts that you just

558
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,640
passing through to execute a beautiful
girl behind Sh

559
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:53,910
yeah but the danger lies ahead there are
any other questions there's one

560
00:44:54,570 --> 00:45:05,310
this time is not the camera so i just
want to mention i think that you had it

561
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:10,410
on slides but you didn't talk about it
when you're doing to your 14 a direction

562
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:12,330
from port 80

563
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:18,870
it's a very common to forget that
nowadays you gotta look up for the ipv6

564
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:24,690
and ipv4 because there are systems that
you just do redirects for ipv4 and

565
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:31,440
forget about the ipv6 and you can be to
first make a record and well you have a

566
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:39,990
cold so your index was nicely done on
the slides for ipv6 and apache was I

567
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:45,029
think I as a site on it for the IP
before

568
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:51,870
no no i think that i saw it but yeah
actually for for the guys here we are

569
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:56,880
ipv6 is something that is not so make
much popular and implemented yet but i

570
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,980
have seen systems that are doing just
the three once only for ipv4 and you can

571
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:07,080
acces the ipv6 without your problem also
just keep in mind that you have to do

572
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:12,870
both things both on ipv4 and ipv6
addresses this is why we insisted on but

573
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:18,540
you see the consistent set up for both
protocols or across your cluster of the

574
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:23,250
Apache example only goes for them for
the hostname and depending on what in

575
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:27,270
results to I can see ya ya ya

576
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:31,620
trust me it's just for the hostname so
depending on your am quite a record it

577
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:36,660
will just work with most important see
on the slide the detector to pump the

578
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,560
font the color is not his mother's
graduates for that sorry for that but

579
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:46,020
some and regarding ipv6 yeah austria is
the same so no it ended selection its IP

580
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,880
not ipv6 for ya

581
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,960
because I didn't legacy IP there's an RC
for them so on

582
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,970
I guess we're not one last one last one
quick one very good one

583
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:59,970
otherwise no quick ones

584
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:07,200
to become something to listen yeah well
thanks for your time
