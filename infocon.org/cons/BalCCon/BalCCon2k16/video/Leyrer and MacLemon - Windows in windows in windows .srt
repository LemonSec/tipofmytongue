1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:36,629
liar and mac lamin will be talking about
Windows Windows and Windows now arms so

2
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:42,149
this is a talk all about how you shall
got flipped turned upside down so let's

3
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,840
take a minute and sit right there and
tell you how to mark's became your

4
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,860
terminal multiplexer so the MC on my
left your right is make lemon and to my

5
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,860
right to your left is lighter

6
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,649
if if you're sitting over if you're
sitting over there and you want to see

7
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:15,270
us move over here it's not that this
will improve your experience but yeah

8
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,270
keep the cheaper places election

9
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,690
yeah we're sitting during the talk
because we're just lazy and all the

10
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,190
relevant stuff will be on the projector
for you to see anyway so you're not

11
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,690
missing anything

12
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,649
we'll start with a quick show of hands
except those hands we can see over there

13
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:40,380
who of you has been using screen user
been screened for some time already

14
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,699
ok there's a choice for everyone so each
of you has to raise their hand at some

15
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,789
point who has been using key marks
already

16
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,170
oh ok ok correct us if we are wrong

17
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,479
who has been using neither of those

18
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:06,270
ok who's already falling asleep with the
perfect that pocket great good will

19
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,560
change that

20
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:15,780
yeah so what is the terminal multiplexer
it's a piece of software that lets you

21
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,390
have multiple terminals inside one
terminal and inside one terminal inside

22
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,640
one terminal of course you can do this
already with your bleep terminal

23
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,589
emulator application you may be already
used taps in there to have multiple

24
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,920
terminals are multiple windows but
there's a bunch of benefits you get with

25
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,280
using t marks or screen if you so desire

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,050
you can keep your hands softly rested on
the keyboard for your comfort of course

27
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:51,420
and if you're adventurous you can even
integrate a pointing device into your

28
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:58,890
terminal like a rodent mouse something
like that and we'll discover a bunch of

29
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,390
interesting use cases

30
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:06,480
why you should use t marks and of course
if you're if you want to use that you

31
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,290
should use t marks all the time because
you'll get the most benefit if it's

32
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,230
there and waiting for you

33
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:18,048
with every terminal use and you hardly
get all the front of the magic unless

34
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:22,430
it's there all the time so if you're not
using a multiplexer yet you're doing it

35
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,430
wrong and if you see a mouse pointer on
the big screens

36
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:36,230
that's not mine that's his arm

37
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,420
yeah if you're already using screen and
are interested in switching to t mark so

38
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,379
there's not a few there's just two
things you can't deal with team sucks

39
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:49,548
that you can do with screen one thing is
getting a serial terminal which is handy

40
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:54,590
for ass bleep I communication yeah and
the other thing is you don't get a roof

41
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,950
in t marks but we're working on that

42
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,790
yeah if you don't know what that means
don't worry that's your screen users

43
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,069
only

44
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:08,599
yeah but somebody might write to tmax
plugin for work for so don't lose

45
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,530
anything

46
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,379
just beware screen does exist it's old
it's the last update of screen is

47
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:21,529
probably older than the whole team works
project so how do you get tmax on your

48
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:25,010
system it's unlikely that it comes
pre-installed I don't know if any is

49
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,780
that comes pre-installed with tmax it
but there's packages for pretty much

50
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:38,000
every linux and bsd that you can think
of the only system where there's no tmax

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,080
packages is the ones that will be using
to demo and you'll see that in a minute

52
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:49,219
and you also want to pretty recent
version of T marks like 2.1 and upwards

53
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:57,050
2.3 or something is the current version
so yeah he makes architecture i have to

54
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,500
talk

55
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,500
oh yeah yeah so in um in corporate

56
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,739
believe me I think there's an on switch

57
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,849
have you tried turning it on

58
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:20,200
yeah so I'm in comparison to screen T
Marks has a nice nifty feature which is

59
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,789
my architecture basically which is a
client-server architecture so you can

60
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:31,210
have one more arty mark servers and one
or several our clients can connect one

61
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:37,570
to one of these servers so you can have
set shared screens that shed

62
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:44,230
tmax sessions sorry you can have shared
sessions between several users which is

63
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:53,350
quite handy for education or two pair
programming and stuff like that or

64
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:59,710
giving a talk about to mix for example
Alice we use your obsession for that so

65
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:07,450
I'm okay again as I said before sspp
already said I'm 11 you can have a

66
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,380
screen within the screen within the
screen so with team works you can have

67
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:16,990
and one server with multiple shells
inside one session so you got inside one

68
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:23,260
team observer can have multiple sessions
which can contain multiple windows which

69
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:29,620
can contain multiple panes we'll get to
that and what that all means because it

70
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,390
doesn't make any sense at this moment
but that's what we want to fix ya so we

71
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,710
basically start off with with multiple
windows which is rather easy to

72
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,900
understand it similar to what you're
known but you know from the browser from

73
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,849
your browser you up usually have several
tabs open in one browser so that's

74
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:54,070
that's the technology working here with
for several hundred tips talk for

75
00:06:54,070 --> 00:07:03,250
yourself so I'm the only thing that for
at least four for the beginner that

76
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,150
sometimes appears to be broken is there

77
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:11,070
scroll back within one shell screen of
11 shell session that you can scroll

78
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,290
back in the shell because tmax takes
over your terminal and tangles the

79
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:22,380
history as well so if you just do a
better job scroll mouse arm up you don't

80
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,790
get the history anymore but that's
fixable and we'll talk about that a

81
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,960
little bit later on

82
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,380
yeah and you actually might like that
for some reason

83
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,500
yeah so armed conflict

84
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,550
yeah of course like most terminal uh
tools tmax can use a cum conflict file

85
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,560
it's called tops t marks . conference in
your home directory and you can put in a

86
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,080
gazillion of options we won't go into
too many details or on how to do these

87
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,859
things just keep in mind you can
configure pretty much everything you can

88
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:02,670
imagine from colors to everything and
key bindings arm so you can set up to

89
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:07,470
max to your liking and customize it for
every need you have one of the one of

90
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:14,490
the major of one of one of the most most
used settings is that you can find the

91
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,110
navigation to the wii I of in bindings
so if you're used to we are you can use

92
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,550
the same keystrokes to navigate around
and then onto stuff so that's that's

93
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,740
rather handy feel like we are user
any-any max users in the house erase all

94
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,300
three hands please

95
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,760
alright so so your other flag sorry

96
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,569
yeah okay yeah we sacrifice to the demo
gods so the rest of the talk will be

97
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:49,680
pretty much a live demo of using t marks
and us embarrassing ourselves we have

98
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,800
prepared a special vm for this case it's
a rather I'm common unknown marks its a

99
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,469
bright quite a well-known but I'm
commonly used the type of linux ya know

100
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:10,020
this is also why we don't have t marks
packages this is a the famously known

101
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,020
hannah montana linux it exists

102
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,150
colombian color theme it's quite
consistent and we try to make our

103
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:28,439
teamworks stuff fit into it so we'll
just open a terminal and yeah we got a

104
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,830
soft pink cursor softly blinking away

105
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:37,500
I'm so for this machine arm baby had me
to hand compiled tmax into into hannah

106
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:44,670
montana linux I don't ask how long this
took yeah it's based on debian etch if

107
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:52,229
you still know that version it was for
debian for so I'm let's let's talk let's

108
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:59,430
start to mix arm so this basically just
are not doing anything in my window

109
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,349
this is not good nineteen hundreds to
set it up okay

110
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,370
just bear with us for a moment we did
not sacrifice enough beer to the demo

111
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,520
God's it seems we'll handle that this
evening

112
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:29,670
yeah the Fed a lot better with the
backward so this is what i just did is

113
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,000
the last part of the talk relax you
don't want to know this at this moment

114
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,300
so to start T marks are you just typed
emacs into into into your shell and

115
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:46,380
nothing much happens except you get a
status bar which the screen users may

116
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,730
already have customized to their use t
max comes with the status bar

117
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,920
out-of-the-box we moved it to the top so
you can easily see it if it's at the

118
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,209
bottom you might have some person
obstructing your view and what you see

119
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:05,490
is on the top left corner there's angle
broker square brackets with zero that's

120
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:12,480
your session a session is just a bunch
of windows group together and we're in

121
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,830
window number 0 which contains a process
named bash so that's just your shell and

122
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:22,320
that status bar and to the right there's
a host name and the date and time you

123
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,960
can configure out that but that's not
important at this moment

124
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:33,780
yeah so um that's not you that's not
much to see that's not not really arm

125
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:39,060
that that interesting what you can do
because as I said before you can have

126
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,859
multiple sessions and multiple servers
but you basically want to do is you want

127
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:50,310
to arm name your session so you can arm
just do a team works nude which will

128
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:56,010
start a new session and with the small s
option you can name your session so if

129
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:01,770
we if we do this at the moment arm
instead of saying deception 0 now says

130
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:07,620
session palkon in the top left corner of
the screen of the window which is nice

131
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:13,860
so we can now work on anything we want
to do so let's start our HR for example

132
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,410
and will give us a nice colorful our
info on what these this machine is

133
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,760
actually doing at the moment

134
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:28,020
I'm if your screen user you probably
know what what comes next here is of

135
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,310
course we can detach from this session
so we can actually leave the session

136
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,599
running in the background disconnected
from the server or if you're on the

137
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,950
train and go through a tunnel elusive
session the application still goes on

138
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,630
which is rather handy if you're running
an install or long-running troubles a

139
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:50,670
ROC chart or something like this doing a
remote desktop grade or something that

140
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:55,469
takes a little time I'm with with
teammates you basically have two options

141
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:01,620
are on how to do this on one is of
course the keyboard shortcuts you can

142
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,510
map every function every every control
everything you can do on onto a piece of

143
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:12,030
turkey sequence the other thing is you
have the command line 40 marks where can

144
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:20,459
enter all the commands manually sweet
i'm can type it out in our demos as we

145
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,200
can show you the keystrokes will
probably spend most of the time i'm

146
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,740
showing you the command line and typing
up the commands which is rather

147
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,450
cumbersome if you watch it but during
during normal work you just use the

148
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:39,660
shortcuts and it says it says it's a lot
faster so I'm detaching detaching yeah

149
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:45,900
for so that teamworks knows that I
repeat stroke is 40 marks it uses

150
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,880
something called the prefix is it with
the the default prefix keep finding is

151
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:57,750
control be screen users are used to
control ii you can of course change that

152
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,490
to your liking

153
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:05,340
we're using the rather strange control
why and why why because it's

154
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,240
conveniently located on my keyboard i'm
using is a german keyboard and so the

155
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,560
wise in the lower left corner next to my
control key and I can't just smash my

156
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,900
hands on the keyboard and have the
team's listen to me but choose whatever

157
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:24,540
you like arm so when you hit stick to
one when you when you hit the prefix

158
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,680
tmax knows ok the next thing is for me
and you're controlling t marks and it

159
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,160
does not handle the next keystrokes on
to the application

160
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,449
running in the shell with into marks so
one option to detach from the shell at

161
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:43,529
the moment would be to tell just hit
prefect prefix a prefix d to detach or i

162
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:50,670
can do a prefix colon which will get me
the tmaxx command line you can see now

163
00:14:50,670 --> 00:15:00,060
in the top top line of the screen so now
i can type detach and if I'm not doing

164
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,079
this I'm have detached from my session
and team oxtails meters and tells me so

165
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,069
which is nice

166
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:10,529
yeah of course you can use prefixes be
like you use ctrl D to exit the shell so

167
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:15,029
you already know that keystroke and
that's really comfy and to show you that

168
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:24,509
there's the the h2o process we started
is still running huh oh yeah sure we'll

169
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:30,389
just look it up in the in the process
list and there you see they're still our

170
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,540
our hatred of process in the background
running this could of course be a

171
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,219
compile job and installer something
whatever you like it should be it should

172
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,500
be something that runs in the command
line and not need x11 GUI or something

173
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,910
like that because you will lose that
information of course so I'm as i said

174
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:53,370
before we can not only have one session
but are two or more sessions so I'm

175
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,800
creating another session are now it's
called the most 01 i create the new

176
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:06,990
session again start this bar shows me
the name of the of the decision and now

177
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,189
i'm getting into into into the area
where it gets confusing because now i

178
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:15,509
have several sessions hour I'll have to
keep track of them

179
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:24,870
so what I can use is T marks are LS or
session and four

180
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,540
what he i prepared that one with but I'm
and it will list me are all the sessions

181
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,260
that are currently currently
long-running on that machine of course

182
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:43,290
this session is too long so teamworks LS
are also works as well and of course it

183
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:50,310
also works on the command line i can do
a this session and it will show me

184
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,329
decisions

185
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:54,689
the nice thing about this one is now I
can move around with the cursor if you

186
00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:03,510
take a look at the arm in the upper left
corner i can move around to count the

187
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:08,129
closer and can actually are you go

188
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:15,419
I can't think i can if you're dead I
should happen and well we're good

189
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:23,370
ok ok I can detach from the session as
well and reattach to any other sessions

190
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:35,370
so in this case our let's switch to arm
50 alcon and then back in my belkin

191
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:42,659
session with a chop still running and if
I want to I can now switch back to our

192
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:51,720
my team won environment by doing arm
prefix colon and to switch tm1 and I'm

193
00:17:51,720 --> 00:18:01,020
back in my demo session with the this
with a less still going i'm skipping

194
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,070
stone

195
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:08,879
mmm yeah after so let's go back to my
belkin session while pepper entertains

196
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,640
you nice thing when listening sessions
you also get the character size of the

197
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,970
terminal since we're both connected to
the same

198
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,120
terminal session here and Tim accession
our terms do not have the same size on

199
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,199
our screen but that does not really
matter if you have used user being

200
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,360
screened to share a session let's run
convenient because it's just cut off and

201
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,199
you don't know where one end so if your
terminals are not aligned that's

202
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,070
inconvenient teamworks takes care of all
that makes that really easy to handle

203
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,690
if your terms are different sizes and
you can always look it up like that

204
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:56,580
yeah yeah yeah okay belkin so I'm the
next the next thing we want to do let's

205
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:02,909
quit HP for a second arm as it before we
can have multiple sessions but we can

206
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,860
also have multiple windows within one
window right now we only have one window

207
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,800
it got the index number 0 and the title
is best because that's the application

208
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:20,639
is currently running in that window what
I cannot do is create a new window which

209
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,950
is a new window of course it wouldn't
start typing that one because it would

210
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:31,410
take ages but now we have in the status
bar you see a window number 0 with a

211
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,670
process called passion and window number
one with another process called bashor

212
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:42,120
HD up teammates automatically renames
your window to the process that is

213
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,310
running inside it and the one that is
accepting your keyboard input also has

214
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,399
an ester is to show you where your
keystrokes are going and which one

215
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:58,440
you're controlling yeah so um the
shortcut of course is see as for create

216
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,880
um as I said before we're sticking with
took with the command line so you can

217
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,350
actually see what you what we are doing
another another option you can do with

218
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:12,870
new window is you can specify the
session the window has should be created

219
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,219
in so I could create another another
window either indecision palkon or

220
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,500
intercession demo 01 we are using it
right now and with the option minus D I

221
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,400
can also specify an application
automatically want to start in that

222
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,290
window so now we're getting where we
know we're getting something

223
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:38,640
well what a second can actually use so
if i do this arm i should get a third

224
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,070
session at that window sorry

225
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:45,780
yeah the third window I with the index
number two because we're starting with 0

226
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,340
and it has already HD running if i
switch over to that window will come to

227
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:58,379
our windows switching in a moment we can
see H top is running here arm of course

228
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:06,690
I can still do one more arm if I'm doing
this ending if i'm typing in the correct

229
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:12,630
window like this i cannot only define
are specified application i want to run

230
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:17,220
but i can also actually named named the
window i'm creating so in this case i'm

231
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:23,429
naming depth arm that window mio top and
I'm running on top in inside that window

232
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:33,630
and if yeah because yeah yeah because i
cannot only do this let's do it properly

233
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:39,210
I cannot only to this fruity from the
arm from the tmaxx command line but also

234
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:46,860
from from my patch from anywhere if I'm
copying correctly and this works because

235
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:52,678
he makes is a client-server architecture
so if you run team works within tmax

236
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,190
window we will just connect to the
server and tell the server to do the

237
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,960
things for them so now I've created
another window called the Maya top it's

238
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,230
got the number three because it's the
fourth window and if i switch over there

239
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:15,660
um I can actually see our top running
yeah yeah so over time you aggregate a

240
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:21,120
bunch of windows inside your team
accession and maybe 25 of them will be

241
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,549
named bash because there's a shell
running doing something or them of

242
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:29,760
course it's becoming inconvenient to
have 27 windows called him

243
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:36,000
I mean not because of women but because
it's not very helpful so you probably

244
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,830
want to switch between the windows and
navigate between them you can go back

245
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:45,340
and forth quite easily you can use the
keyboard commands prefix

246
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,139
in for next and prefix p for previous so
if you watch the status line with the

247
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:56,710
asterisk is as we switch and go back and
forth between the windows you see the

248
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:06,580
asterisk moving to tell us where we
ended up and of course you can switch

249
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:12,699
even faster by addressing any window
bites number so if you want to switch to

250
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:18,280
the window to the window number three
you can type prefix three and will

251
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:24,879
directly go there since team access
saying defaults it starts number is it

252
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,610
zero-based indexing I'm unfortunately
your keyboard it's not zero indexed

253
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:35,020
because the numbers start with one and
the zeros on the right-hand side you can

254
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:41,650
actually tell t marks to start numbering
at one so your keyboard matches the

255
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:47,470
order in which your windows are aligned
on screen which is quite convenient so

256
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:53,320
switching switching back to window
number 12 index number one which is when

257
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:59,350
the number 2 i'm we can of course
renamed that window now 42 something

258
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:04,990
different so let's say arm i want to
rename my window to w2 because its

259
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,280
window number two and now it's called
witness number 2 although I'm still

260
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,800
running passion inside windows so that
works that works quite well as well this

261
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,419
will get you around having a bunch of
like named windows that you can't

262
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,800
distinguish easily

263
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,649
also if you're like running like an
install process which switches happily

264
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:33,910
before back and forth between compile
make GCC and your window name will

265
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:39,400
constantly change and if it's running
multiple processes with different

266
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,630
lengths names it will start wobbling
around which is rather inconvenient so

267
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:48,070
you just named about compile drop
something and it will stay that way

268
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:56,050
so yes we're renaming a window to fix
name comes in so that the last thing we

269
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,159
want to show you with Windows is

270
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:05,510
something rather interesting for this i
will a detach from the current session

271
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:13,610
from the current session so are going to
touch you can now see there is no t

272
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:19,610
marks status pound the top so we've
we've dropped down from the are from the

273
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:25,399
session and what I can do as we have
assigned server architecture I can

274
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,630
communicate with the server and tell it
tell it different commands one of those

275
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:35,900
commands is sent keys so I can actually
send any key i want to add to any

276
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:42,650
accession any window I i choose to do so
in this case i'm connecting i'm sending

277
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:48,410
keys to my session called palkon and
with the number 2 i'm addressing the

278
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,840
third window

279
00:25:50,840 --> 00:26:00,590
yeah let's do this in the second window
because I prepared it like this and what

280
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:04,040
I'm sending is echo hello palkon are too
that would know

281
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,860
so nothing really happened at this
moment at least we can see it so let's

282
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:16,370
are attached to the Falcon session again
and as we are already in the second

283
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:20,719
window which is the index number one
terrorist ring i sent to that window so

284
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:28,340
I'm i'll leave it as an exercise to you
to imagine what you could do with such a

285
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,270
thing with letting your teammates type
remote commands into a server that you

286
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:39,590
can't see what could possibly go wrong
like get addressing the wrong window

287
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:45,379
maybe on the wrong server on the wrong
machining not using a cold but some

288
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,540
other kamari won't

289
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:53,389
yeah there's lots of fun to be had with
remote typing in Windows you can see so

290
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:59,330
what I also mentioned was that we can
not only have one knows but we can also

291
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:06,080
have pains so a pain is a part that is a
part of a window so I can actually split

292
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,379
my windows are apart the sounds

293
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,410
more aggressive than it actually is

294
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:19,140
you can do as when in terminal you can
only do our horizontal and vertical

295
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,720
splits not die out diet dialga diet
diagonal that's not possible at the

296
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,030
moment I'm the thing is with the
vertical and the horizontal split they

297
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,210
would work in mysterious ways

298
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:38,370
yeah they're not the easiest way to
remember those let let's see if you can

299
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:45,239
spot the issue here so for a vertical
splits arm i can do a prefix arm double

300
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,590
quote the prefix double quote I will do
this this is a horizontal split know

301
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,669
this is a vertical split this is what
tmax calls a vertical smile little split

302
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:59,760
yeah so would you would you agree this
is a vertical split so we can already

303
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,780
see the issue that we do not really
agree if this is a vertical or

304
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,860
horizontal split can you demo as a
horizontal split of course with the

305
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:13,320
conveniently mapped default printer
shortcut of prefix percent which has a

306
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,120
diagonal line is over

307
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,790
is this what is it um yeah so we now get
the second the second plane on the

308
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:26,430
right-hand side so we have a harder song
possibly so what I like to do to fix my

309
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:31,440
brain to match things going on in my
terminal is to remap those default key

310
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,360
bindings and we have convenient
characters that match the lines that

311
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,260
break up your paints so we have the pipe
symbol used for plumbing in your shell

312
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,820
and I use that to get a vertical line
even if he makes considers that the

313
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,950
horizontal split co-sleeper pains are
split horizontally against each other

314
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:54,930
and i use the minus $OPERAND which is
horizontal line to get what he must

315
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,100
consider the vertical split that still
helps my brain to get what I need

316
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,439
whatever its called

317
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,130
yeah I don't care what it's called it i
want this line and I want this line so

318
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:10,170
this is why we remapped key bindings and
tmax to get the same thing working right

319
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:14,790
so of course this is not only works for
routine arm for the shortcuts which use

320
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:19,470
which basically divides the current pain
of the current window in half

321
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,740
this also works of course produce fruit
the command line

322
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,809
and from the command line i have a few
options I can arm i can additionally add

323
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:34,050
so with a split-window is basically my
command through a minus B on minus H I

324
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:38,820
can specify the vertical or horizontal
split you can't remember those things

325
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:45,720
and with the option minus L i can
actually define the number of lines for

326
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:53,700
a vertical split so in this case i'll
split this window vertically of front of

327
00:29:53,700 --> 00:30:00,090
you of t marks with five lines and this
if I'm too interested in the right

328
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:04,678
window so you can see at the bottom you
got the 5 line 25 line pain and the

329
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:09,540
owner on the top you got the the large
lot of the larger plane containing all

330
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,260
the all the other our lines in inside
that window

331
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,330
yeah of course this navigate give me a
second okay so the same the same of

332
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:24,629
course goes 40 horizontal split for the
horizontal split the option is minus p

333
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:39,450
for our love columns and again we have
the arm split worry

334
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:44,580
yeah but why would you want to and
evenly split your your your pains in in

335
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,590
the window that's quite convenient to
have like a development setup where you

336
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:54,990
have a large pain where your editor for
kotas on the bottom you see for you for

337
00:30:54,990 --> 00:31:00,090
example your test system that shows you
if your test work and on the right-hand

338
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:05,580
side you might have some system log
output or a few lines with status or

339
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:11,490
your chat client or something so you can
just set up the thing that always looks

340
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:14,490
the same and gives you your setup as you
like it

341
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:19,090
of course you can you can move between
those um

342
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:24,370
pains this is you can wrap it to any
case you want one of the one of the

343
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:29,770
options would be to use our prefix oh
and if this will be fun doing this in

344
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:36,340
the right window sorry for that which
will switch frou-frou different pains as

345
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,689
you can see the curses at the cause of
wanders from one pain to the other two

346
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:46,060
always just rotate as it goes around in
a circle between all existing pains you

347
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:50,860
can directly hop from one to another
which is done by using prefix and the

348
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,879
arrow key in the direction you want to
hop so if you press prefix and the right

349
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,130
arrow it will help to the next most
right pane that is available and the

350
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:05,980
same goes for like popping to the bottom
and potential i'm just waiting for your

351
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:11,860
command because I i do I can remote
control tmax we r martin it that's

352
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:16,300
pretty easy to remember another another
way to move around in the paint is by

353
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:21,280
directly addressing the pain there's a
convenient for our function that is

354
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:28,120
usually map to prefix q and with prefix
q we will get that we will get the

355
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:35,530
numbering of the pain so we start again
with 0 with 0 1 and 2 and this will also

356
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:40,210
students again i will also show you if
you look at the top-right corner of each

357
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,710
pain it will show you the resolution of
that big resolution in characters

358
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:48,100
resolution here because we grew up in
resolution is given and characters

359
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:56,709
nothing pixels on mega pixels or ok I'm
and you can actually address you can see

360
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:01,570
that the right number one this is the
current pain we are focusing on arm i

361
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:06,159
haven't done that we should have done
said that the time of cholera and

362
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:12,550
without selecting depressing to i can
now switch over to the second pain if i

363
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:19,060
do this again arm i can do a zero and
I'm in the top left are a pain and so on

364
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:26,379
our q2 and then pick it up in the bottom
in the bottom our pain so I rather easy

365
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,429
moving around and giving

366
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:36,619
giving t the pain especially if more
than two or three panes this is this is

367
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:40,220
rather convenient feature don't try to
do more than nine paints in one window

368
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:48,019
you will all this is more pain pain of
course are another thing you can do is

369
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:52,279
you can resize your pain so i'm now
ended in the bottom in the bottom pane

370
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:56,990
with the five lines and decide oh this
is an interesting a lock this is an

371
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:57,980
interesting lock

372
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:03,769
I want to see more of that locker I want
to see more lines i can just do a prefix

373
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:19,069
arm when prefix I prefix alt and closer
up everything . that sort of your mama

374
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:25,909
ya-ya so when you press prefix and then
optional part depending on your keyboard

375
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:36,230
and use the arrow keys you can just
start moving around that that's line to

376
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,510
wherever you want it to be

377
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,129
of course this works horizontally as
well you can just on-the-fly resize it

378
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:48,500
if you decide okay I'll need a few more
lines because th top is just not very

379
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,179
fun in four lines

380
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:54,889
another thing is as a described before
you see something interesting it wasn't

381
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:58,819
want to see more details or as i have
done right now I've started h top at the

382
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:03,259
bottom and I can't really see the
processes so a quick way to do this is

383
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:10,130
the that is the so-called pain soon so I
can just tell tmax assume into that pain

384
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:14,869
and show me the full details of that
pain so through prefix that or see as

385
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:23,869
the Americans say yeah z4 zoom zooms
into that pain shows me that pain and by

386
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:30,859
that this is actually not resize your
pains in any way it just zooms into that

387
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:35,150
one and gives you that one pain in full
screen if you look at the status bar at

388
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,920
the top in the window number 0 where

389
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,640
we have a process called hey stop
there's the asterisk show you this one

390
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,690
is expecting your keyboard input and
their Z which tells you this one zoomed

391
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:51,630
in at the moment and with prefix see you
can toggle the zoom in and out again so

392
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,349
if you zoom out again busy in the status
bar will go away and we'll just pop back

393
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:59,880
to where it was without affecting the
layout you have meticulously prepared to

394
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,020
your liking

395
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:06,930
exactly I another thing another thing
you sometimes want to do is you have you

396
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,819
have your your your tail running or your
H top of whatever I'm and you you

397
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:16,259
suddenly realize I it's not a good idea
to have that in one pain i actually

398
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:22,770
wanted in a separate window I want to
make right break out that pain I'm so

399
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:31,170
there's also a command for that arm
conveniently called break pain so with

400
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,670
brake been armed

401
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:39,930
I'll get a new window our window number
four in our case running a chop and if i

402
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:47,460
switch back to window number one our
announce the winner number zero the pain

403
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,680
the pain I've had I've had here is is
now gone because it's got its it were it

404
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,859
went to window number for this is also
convenient to when you realize oh I

405
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:02,640
should have started that process
somewhere else but it's already running

406
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,960
for five minutes and I don't want to
cancel it and started again you can just

407
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,329
break it out into a window and see all
of it without having to control C and

408
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:15,390
start over any protective idea how we on
time

409
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:22,770
it's half-past eight I have no idea how
long do we have but we can go on forever

410
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:29,280
couple of minutes out fighting ok so we
are actually on time surprisingly oh um

411
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,290
there's one thing that's quite quite
quite tiny languages close this one here

412
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:43,470
are out there of course a few teammates
commands are to help are no let me else

413
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,319
which else which the script around sorry
for that

414
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:52,229
there's another thing you can do I and
as I said before we have a client-server

415
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:59,489
architecture so you could actually
prepare something like something like

416
00:37:59,489 --> 00:38:05,489
this so you can actually have a small
small text file containing a few tmax

417
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:11,099
commands like create a new window create
new pain starter plication the pain and

418
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:18,509
what you can do is you can source that
and it will automatically created that

419
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:23,640
the setup you want so you and you can
give this this for example at the

420
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,469
beginning of T marks so if you have your
IDE set up your your your problem

421
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:33,569
logging logging environment whatever I'm
it's just a few keystrokes away and you

422
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:38,670
got your teamwork set up the way you
want so rather easy convenient way to to

423
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:43,229
configure t marks in a hurry so he makes
is fully scriptable everything you can

424
00:38:43,229 --> 00:38:48,989
do interactively with key strokes or
above the team's command line you can

425
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:54,449
actually put into a script and have
launched at system boot for example many

426
00:38:54,449 --> 00:39:00,479
people use this to have their like Izzy
IRC client launched in an energy mark

427
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:04,078
session in a window in the background
when the machine comes up and they can

428
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,579
just ssh into that machine and is
already collecting locks and power

429
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,829
idling for you because you're never
there

430
00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:16,949
um one thing is work with team works is
you will get lost you will get a how

431
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:22,049
many sessions to have what window is
where is cetera so we have tmax info

432
00:39:22,049 --> 00:39:27,359
which will give you info on all the arm
all the sessions all the settings all

433
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:33,479
the all the things you you want to know
about a party marks on your team mark

434
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:42,538
set up the last thing one more thing for
one thing let me touch here are for this

435
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:47,789
i will also create the new session the
new session i'll call sink pain which

436
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:53,249
will give you probably will give you an
igloo a clue on what we're going to do

437
00:39:53,249 --> 00:40:05,819
um i will create if I hit the right key
shift german keyboard arm out rate three

438
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:15,839
panes arm in this 1i will change into /
gtc and in this 1i will change into / up

439
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:24,690
and now moved to the first one and what
I can do now is a collar command named

440
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:32,519
synchronize pains so what i can do is i
can tilty marks whatever whatever type

441
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:39,479
in the first the first pain also type in
the other pains so now we have deep into

442
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:46,769
cloud and and and admin admin land so
let's stop this and I cannot do the easy

443
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:53,279
one LS and it will do the ALS in all
three armed in all three panes and we'll

444
00:40:53,279 --> 00:40:55,229
see what what what happens there

445
00:40:55,229 --> 00:41:01,859
of course this is not our this is not
done are on our this is this is not this

446
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:06,509
is done on all three planes and it's not
limited to LS what I can we do what he

447
00:41:06,509 --> 00:41:12,539
could do is ssh into another machine and
you can do an LS on that devour remote

448
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:17,160
machine fruity bucks so each of these
pains could be connected to a different

449
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,868
server and you could accidentally reboot
not only one wrong server but the whole

450
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:28,890
cluster so this is easy to use as a
cluster shell replacement or oh I need

451
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:34,410
to update 5 debian boxes and it's the
same on all so you just get a bunch of

452
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:40,170
paints ssh into each of them man you can
do the happy dist-upgrade path easily

453
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:46,499
with five boxes in a row or the RM / or
whatever you like to do so don't get it

454
00:41:46,499 --> 00:41:47,149
wrong

455
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:55,490
I'm as we are on almost on time there's
also another nice feature and he marks

456
00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:01,669
called a big clock so we've prefix t4
time t max will show you the current

457
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:06,620
time which is we've already over the
one-hour session sorry for that and of

458
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:11,990
course the timezone is incorrectly said
on that vm it's somewhere else us like

459
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,450
it's not synchronized to our clock here

460
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:20,839
yeah sorry for that I'm on another thing
the last thing I wanted to show you is

461
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,930
armed

462
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:33,319
yah yah i mentioned that deep now it's
here

463
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:42,080
I'm means I little criticism i mentioned
that we can have several sessions are

464
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:48,230
each session listens on a specific port
this port I can actually a circulatory

465
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:54,950
support socket are each socket I can
specify it you're in creation and I can

466
00:42:54,950 --> 00:43:02,029
specify our rights to that so i can give
this is what we have done here with

467
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:06,470
created another we've created team
accession in within a team accession and

468
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:11,569
for the first time accession i created
this special our socket and I gave

469
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:19,520
access to the group eh16 and so epic
could actually are trying that session

470
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:26,780
and type type type type while but while
i'm typing so rather run a convenient

471
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:31,460
especially for so you can have free we
actually had free shell windows 11 that

472
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,270
we've seen one of his on his machine and
one on my machine and we were presenting

473
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:40,220
and were able if I ever concentrating it
would be able to look at my screen and

474
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:44,209
see what's happening on the big screen
up there so you can use that to have

475
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:48,500
multiple people at Minister the same
server you can get your pad advanced

476
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:53,240
admin and show them some stuff for you
can do pair programming or learning

477
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:57,649
teaching or giving a presentation you
want to show in a terminal and share the

478
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,310
same section so each person can use
their own

479
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:07,000
keyboard and type together into the same
thing on the on the projector the

480
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,810
benefit of T marks over screen of course
with screen you can actually do pretty

481
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:15,100
much the same with sharing a session
with the downside with screen you have

482
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:21,549
to use the sexuality route which we all
like of course to have fineries have set

483
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:26,920
the very root with the max that is not
necessary you just create a socket give

484
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:33,760
it a user get a group and you're all set
with that we have a few a few links will

485
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,490
probably put up in the Indian Army india
with different on the frap yeah you can

486
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:44,169
get the land with that we come to the
interesting part of questions um I don't

487
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:50,380
know how we aren't I'm we have a problem
if 11 question maybe to what will people

488
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,520
still with them we are here until sunday
evening so if any further questions we

489
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,980
will find that the Levant wheel Metalab
assembly and just drop by and then apply

490
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,870
and we'll know you yet

491
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:07,270
ok so he's got the hands up for a long
time the one single question it but

492
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:14,020
let's see i can you actually actually
unsynchronized pains answer from John

493
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,000
yeah for sure

494
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,890
don't ask me hard and don't ask me at
the moment ok it's possible as possible

495
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:27,160
yeah we're quick one quick questions
please it won't last

496
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,720
yeah its sequence is the max your
ultimate recommendation because there's

497
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,399
another 1i think multiplexer their
screen there's teamwork centers another

498
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,080
one I cannot remember the name

499
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:42,910
there's people from the want to project
i'm not sure but yea yea that there's

500
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:48,399
multiple projects arm just I personally
like to mix a lot its bsd license

501
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,730
it's a very modern thing the
configuration is a lot of attention

502
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:56,140
situating future voice feature wise i
don't know enough about the features of

503
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:02,560
available regarding screen it's some
there's not too much difference t max is

504
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,370
a lot faster and screen redrawing
especially over slow connections which

505
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:09,230
is quite handy when you're on like
tethering on the phone or

506
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:13,820
about just a slow connection our team
sucks is actively developed has actually

507
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:18,920
seen since spring there was there were
two releases I'm a improving on the

508
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,630
utf-8 support and stuff like that so
there's a lot of stuff going on your

509
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:26,960
lock in project i SOT makes it is

510
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,650
yeah yeah if you haven't used anything
i'd recommend you start with T marks

511
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:35,420
keep in mind there is screen so if you
occasionally step across the very old

512
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:40,910
solaris box somewhere you might only get
screen to run there which will still

513
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:41,569
help you

514
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:48,500
ok thanks go too much okay okay well
yeah you will probably find us up one

515
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:53,780
last one is ok could you have a
configuration that runs from when we

516
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:59,210
start remarks like multi windows or
something like that

517
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:05,210
yeah you can have that ok but that's the
script thing we showed yeah you can run

518
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:09,890
to mix with the script to set all that
up and you have the 30 marks dot com

519
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:15,618
file in your home directory to configure
all the key bindings and colors or it

520
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:21,530
does not have to be pink but there's
more choices just give it just start to

521
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:25,910
mix with minus C and the script and it
will execute all the all the all the

522
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,319
settings you want

523
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,710
thank you okay thanks for your time
thank you
