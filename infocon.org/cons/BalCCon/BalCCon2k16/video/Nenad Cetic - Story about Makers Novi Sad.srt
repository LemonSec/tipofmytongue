1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:26,009
welcome to the second they are barking
2k16 first lecture will be about making

2
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,030
snow sides presented by nana chatted if
you have any questions you can

3
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,030
microphone that I dare and ask

4
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,500
thank you hello everyone

5
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:54,450
a lot of makers in this room I must say
but maybe some of you know know yet

6
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,860
my name is a tradition I really rtk
Institute computer-based systems from

7
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:11,310
the Assad and i will try to briefly show
you where we are right now we introduce

8
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:21,900
yourself a year ago on a welcome 2015
and we did a lot i think you will be

9
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:31,740
judged by looking at the presentation
and we have a nice activities outside so

10
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:40,770
we'll talk about that in a second part
of the presentation so who we are what

11
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:48,240
we do and what is this all about where
we will talk about the famous maker

12
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,149
manifest of course and we will show of
activities from this Community and what

13
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:00,450
we did with a bunch of young makers some
of them are sitting proudly in this room

14
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:08,519
and we are also part of some of the
worldwide communities and for the last

15
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:11,900
part of the presentation we will talk
about our

16
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:20,450
toys however software forever and what
we are actually trying to do here so

17
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:33,530
first of all famous my catch recent news
is a former CEO of that shop so we are

18
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:40,640
looking what is going to be the next and
tack shop thing like that this guy that

19
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:48,858
but for some of you that doesn't know
about the maker movement is very strong

20
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:58,010
in America this mark said character made
a bunch of revolutionary stuff in

21
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:06,888
America pretty much opening that the by
opening maker spaces in the area mainly

22
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:15,349
and he is also an author or famous maker
manifest the book which outlines a few

23
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:22,668
canopy principles of making and being a
maker what what does that mean actually

24
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:29,750
so first of all of course is make we are
all trying to make something anything

25
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:35,720
pretty much from Seoul during
programming where we are for the most

26
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:44,690
part but also meeting or painting or art
or whatever you think that that is stuff

27
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:52,310
that you're interested in and you want
to make something your maker the really

28
00:03:52,310 --> 00:04:01,310
important part of the making community
and and and and making body is to share

29
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,269
so whatever you trying to make share
with everybody

30
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,720
share your knowledge and share making
and makers experience so that everybody

31
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,260
can become a better maker and everybody
is having fun

32
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:26,159
that of course we all learned through
hole our life and my learning in maker

33
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,650
manifesto we're trying to always come up
with a better solution trying to make a

34
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:41,400
good way of doing things and and better
things and maybe discover some mistakes

35
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,630
and never do it again and stuff like
that but the learning is also part of

36
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:53,880
the process and imported by aspect is of
course a lot of fun and teamwork so team

37
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:01,800
and a lot of fun and all that makes
together we'll probably end up being one

38
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,190
of makers community all over

39
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:18,060
so in this lecture of course we're
focusing on on makers and ask why we

40
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,640
call it but that this is a little bit
wider since now we have makers from some

41
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,650
bar and makers from the hand also

42
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:33,750
so it's a open community with a free
membership all we need to do is to go to

43
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:42,690
meet up and sign up our mission is to
discover and and research all the new

44
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:50,910
technologies we are mostly concentrated
about technologies around IOT but we are

45
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:56,280
not limited to that you will see and we
want to share that knowledge we want to

46
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,559
share this experience with you and we
are welcoming everybody that that is

47
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:11,040
willing to to make of course the two to
make some things easier we also read

48
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:18,660
registered the maker association but
little bit more about that in a couple

49
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,480
of slide so this is a famous photo first
meetup

50
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:32,609
like everything else it starts in a bar
of course with a couple drinks your

51
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:40,830
friends gather around the similar topics
and simmer in interest came together and

52
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:47,370
said okay yeah let's make a movement and
and and try to organize maker community

53
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:54,690
and since then we also celebrated our
birthday you can see by the low if you

54
00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:04,080
can read recently so we are real angry
we don't have too much in in a calendar

55
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:11,849
wise experience but we been through a
lot of fun things and and really

56
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:18,450
organized a lot of events i learned
about this a little bit later

57
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:24,180
not from the very beginning and soon I
realized yeah this is it

58
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:31,739
I don't have to go through America to be
a part of the make community they're

59
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:38,730
here it is in Serbia and I immediately
join i was really inspired by by zoran

60
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:45,690
speech and unwelcome year ago and this
is me on the Texas Instruments day

61
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:55,530
present presenting what they did with a
with my students and faculty and talking

62
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:03,179
about some technologies and sharing some
some knowledge and some neither the next

63
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:11,490
event was about Cyprus day by young
dolly night sitting over there then we

64
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:18,330
learn about the cool technology cybers i
will share what i learned from from yon

65
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:27,810
little bit later and a bunch of other
activities as well so event with the

66
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,930
huge crowd here

67
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:41,039
about photon a particle photon
technology and regional collaboration

68
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:51,270
with some friends from Romania this was
a meetup in German after that there was

69
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:59,550
a are doing a day the world why
celebration of Arduino or generally

70
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:10,469
known in Europe we organized a nice
exhibition in one of the high schools

71
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,240
that it is part of this community and it
was a lot of fun

72
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:22,770
it will see a couple more pictures from
that day then came a world I OT day we

73
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:31,709
also presented some of our work and you
will see usually a lot of young people

74
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:39,209
here so this is this is the key aspect
this is the the main point for me at

75
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:47,040
least while I'm here trying to to share
and trying to teach some new guys being

76
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,079
makers little bit about programming
little brother about electronics and all

77
00:09:52,080 --> 00:10:00,750
the things that we are trying to do for
for our day jobs we are spilling that

78
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:09,209
over to this young little bright and
very very talented heads and and this is

79
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:18,089
a picture from one meet up in some board
hacking robots where we played with with

80
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:26,310
the controlling motors and controlling
some robots then a again with the IT

81
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:35,609
talks about the intellectual technology
and censoring Arctic cloud technology so

82
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:40,470
you can see that that it's not always
only the talk

83
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,500
it's sort of workshop where we're trying
to

84
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:53,820
teach somebody about the imaging how to
do something with it then as is icing on

85
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:02,460
a cake good friend of ours borko came
and introduced 3d printing technology to

86
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,530
the makers community and north side and
we had a really good event with the

87
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:15,329
learning about 3d printing with some of
the friends from Romania and showing a

88
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:25,020
printers in action of course but also
learning about all this from from very

89
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:35,160
experienced guys and we have a bunch of
stuff on our roadmap microsoft the

90
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:42,060
synergy is coming up and we're planning
some some other workshops at that you

91
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:48,300
can see I've been hope that we will do a
lot of new cool stuff and continue with

92
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,719
this kind of energy with with the middle
although the things that we come up so

93
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:06,390
far so very very important aspect they
all the outline is this young people and

94
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:21,810
we are organizing sort of a weekly get
together workshops with with three high

95
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:27,420
schools here actually the second high
school was accosted by Mossad introduces

96
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:32,099
some of the stuff that we did earlier
inside of general

97
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:39,149
classes and lectures that the minute
that kids are having from from

98
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:47,730
informatics so instead of programming in
some Pascal on desktop computer

99
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:54,180
they are also programming on arduino and
can see a physical manifestation of the

100
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,979
program with with some sense or some
melodies or some stepper motor or

101
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,440
something like that and we are very
proud that that high school from

102
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,080
technical science from somewhere

103
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:15,089
join our movement they had a really
strong school for robotics there and

104
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:19,920
with their help and all the bike it's
coming through our movement a movement

105
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:31,199
is is much much stronger and disrespect
to help everybody achieved this goal

106
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:41,459
we're trying to put all the facilities
in people's hands and this is the

107
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:53,369
example we created a maker space where
kids can come in and grab the sensors

108
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,830
control erosion something that we have
in our arsenal and play really make

109
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:05,610
something so this is this is very cool
and very important it's not super

110
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:11,850
formalized yet so we are still looking
for for a better location or maybe more

111
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,020
convenient location about this but
energies here you can see the upon the

112
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:21,089
pictures kids are there and and making
something in and having a lot of fun

113
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:32,850
making schools were part of some major
events in iterations about the this kind

114
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:38,640
of technology and synergy 2015 itd in
Zagreb

115
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:47,310
and IOT week 2016 invalid as well where
they were being interviewed by national

116
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:56,790
TV and giving who was talking a moment
so so we have a real young ambassador of

117
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:04,469
this morning talking to a national TV
channel and and promoting making so what

118
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,300
can be better than that

119
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:13,500
this is a picture from famous the Dino
day you can see a lot of smiling faces

120
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:22,589
and on the you're right you see the
example of how we do stuff and how we

121
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:30,390
try to teach this is the the half of
this crowd is never touched arduino

122
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:41,339
before and other other half is our older
calling for older members and while

123
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:47,760
lecture is explaining what to do and
what is the exercise more experienced

124
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,130
guy are working together with less
experienced guys and helping them going

125
00:15:53,130 --> 00:16:00,839
through exercises and this is really all
about making a collaboration and

126
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:13,380
teamwork and everybody gets happier with
the results that way so then our

127
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:21,450
worldwide communities and an impact we
are members of something that is called

128
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:30,510
dexter and dexter live movement is a
worldwide community where people all

129
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,850
around the world are trying to publish
projects and share knowledge and

130
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,980
technologies and we're receiving some of
the function and

131
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:49,800
and pretty much partner and toys and
promotional material from them and also

132
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,870
we've been a part of of European maker
week

133
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:07,949
this is a 1-1 organization coming from a
big make movement helped by a your

134
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:14,699
commission so what is dexter live you
can learn about it going to this web

135
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:25,350
address extra io play much this is a hob
somebody may be heard for them older

136
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:35,459
version of this old hack a day and this
is similar but more organized about

137
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:44,970
making and that kind of activities in
community and a hundred-plus location

138
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:52,440
all around the world with a hand hundred
and plus ambassador that that are trying

139
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:59,370
to promote new technologies and try to
be helpful for for all the developers

140
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:06,600
and and community from this is one of
six thousand babies now this is this is

141
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,340
other whole slide right now so it's
becoming bigger and bigger as we speak a

142
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:20,070
lot of lot of cool and and vibrant the
activities there we are among others

143
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:31,590
with with a special help to of and
engages from our president is on who is

144
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:42,389
a first ex-ambassador came on this world
wide map along with other countries you

145
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,860
can see the spain and netherlands and
Mexico and

146
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:57,549
a lot of makers from India and all over
the world so it's also about the

147
00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:06,580
sponsorship here so we are receiving
we're receiving a direct support to

148
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:14,350
Hector from major players in this area
now like Microsoft amazone the Nordic

149
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:24,639
spain and in told sparkfun afraid and by
3x that we have access to all the latest

150
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,960
and greatest and even pre-releases or
some of the technologies pretty much

151
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:42,549
texture community was the first and only
community that got access to some latest

152
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:48,580
technologies from amazon and and stuff
like that said you will see well some

153
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:54,879
more details when we talk about
technology here so the maker week is

154
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:06,040
part of this movement is sponsored by
famous maker faire this is where we meet

155
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:13,330
with Mark IX crew and all that energy
coming from from a big maker community

156
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:22,840
and this is that the one week of
promotion being a maker and again we are

157
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:35,590
ambassadors here to try to organize in
Europe lot of events during one week to

158
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:43,360
to actually promote making and to be a
part of this community and actually to

159
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:52,178
celebrate making so you can see how a
lot of density of course near the home

160
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:57,510
of Arduino in Italy but three spots are
there

161
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:04,980
as well in Serbia someone Belgrade and
Mossad these are the events that we

162
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,840
organized during this week

163
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,459
special thanks to polyhedra and borko
and special thanks to kill the center

164
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:19,320
for one event and of course created for
all the the people from a maker

165
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:25,590
community from the Assad and engineering
and some bored with all the events in

166
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:32,520
lectures that we gave in also
exhibitions from a European week so that

167
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,460
this was some this is something
something from from this European week

168
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:50,400
first picture is from high school from
really sad where our friends exhibition

169
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,890
there their work and and pretty much
it's open door everybody could come in

170
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:02,040
and see what they're making you will
have a similar experience in a hole

171
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:08,820
after this talk and you will see some
some of the projects and you can talk to

172
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:17,100
them and and learn more about that you
can see the another event on the Left

173
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:26,909
where we gave first class again for a
little bit older crowd back in the zinc

174
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:33,540
conference where we also promoted our
moment this was the the quick hands on

175
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:45,930
exhibition and and workshop from about
particle which we'll talk about a little

176
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:53,640
bit more in detail afterwards so these
are the the main association members all

177
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,260
the names here the part of the
Association formal Association maker

178
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:06,120
this is just for for having something on
a paper that we can organize that some

179
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,729
me

180
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:13,090
just work here and i think i got
ordering right through to project really

181
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:26,320
show people that are joining how how
things are becoming a massive and then

182
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:33,159
the second part of this presentation is
going to be about the technologies we

183
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:41,140
cannot talk about makers if we don't
mention are doing of course a plate with

184
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:47,650
arduino here or or maybe never played
without being raised their hand I don't

185
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,000
want to bother with you

186
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,450
where are you well with the details
about the technology because it's really

187
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:02,740
really famous but this is sort of Honor
dimension because everything everything

188
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,630
in the maker community started with with
this tiny chip it was not so tiny in

189
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:17,919
this version but now your reasons are in
in a small technology and what is that

190
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:25,780
the key aspect of this it's not the the
technology is so great

191
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,790
it's not that they have a best tool
chain in the world is not that that

192
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:37,240
you're going to be on a cutting your
bleeding edge of technology it's about

193
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:44,980
the community so community from our Dino
is sharing the knowledge pretty much any

194
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:53,320
idea that costume your mind you can
google it out and find a really a quick

195
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,320
and good point to start your project and
then tweak it and in share back with the

196
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,290
community

197
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:12,100
why is it so successful in my opinion is
because of this thing on the screen over

198
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,559
here this is a

199
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,070
old sketch and it's really really simple

200
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:24,189
so you basically have to program two
functions one is setup which is going to

201
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:30,940
be executed in return you turn on your
adrenal and other is pretty much endless

202
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:39,730
loop where your program your your
programming logic and this is really

203
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:50,200
easy to understand and having the
lectures in few hours you're going to be

204
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:57,249
a renal vein fan and make your blinking
LED project or something more advanced

205
00:25:57,249 --> 00:26:13,179
really really really quick then of
course there is this air out with

206
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:22,240
everything going wireless and arduino
has a nice answer to that which is this

207
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:30,399
maker 1000 this is a smaller version
that has had packing the the Wi-Fi chip

208
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:39,758
as well and you can see this is cortex
am 03 to beat processor blah blah

209
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:49,149
it has integrated battery charger so you
can make your device battery operated if

210
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:55,629
you like a power management but if you
buy this thing in your experience with

211
00:26:55,629 --> 00:27:04,600
the with all our Dino watch out its 3.3
walls so don't burn it immediately

212
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:14,980
also this is another early well mention
i think everybody can can

213
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:26,890
recognize what is is this is of course
famous pie roseberry pie yum yum this

214
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:33,880
it started as a personal computer for
everybody that you can buy really cheap

215
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:42,190
and make your personal computing on the
go but turned out to be a really really

216
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:50,380
useful tool for making stuff so you have
a really powerful processors here

217
00:27:50,380 --> 00:28:02,020
running linux and and you can do a lot
of stuff what we do it's made a school

218
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:10,090
bell inn in high school so how instead
of a little bit uglier sound now they

219
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:19,360
have a nicer version of the ring and
playing the air mp3 on on their quarters

220
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,620
in high school

221
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:27,699
marking where when classes begins and
ends and went break begins even more

222
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:35,290
importantly the reason those bodies
already . 3

223
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:44,170
what is new with this its blood low
energy integrated into rosemary pie so

224
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:54,610
now you can have your Smart Hub talking
to internet Wi-Fi and talking to your

225
00:28:54,610 --> 00:29:01,179
Internet of Things devices over
bluetooth in your room for instance so

226
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:08,440
again they are putting this margin
really really low and maybe we're not

227
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:15,550
making profits of it by making it
terrified box there are more advanced

228
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:20,470
kids set up two hundred radio have
another nice casing and

229
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:29,140
some sensors and stuff like that but the
original development board is is 35 box

230
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:40,000
which is also amazing for a personal
computer like that then back to TI this

231
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:55,659
is c200 how they call it simple link
it's a Wi-Fi chip we played with it it

232
00:29:55,659 --> 00:30:05,169
has a arm core and the full spectrum of
of all the things all the bells and

233
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:09,760
whistles that you need to make stuff all
the peripherals and and and

234
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,510
interconnections so their right to ski

235
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:25,809
I to see even is chris and $TIME p.m.
ABC and all that almost cheap where you

236
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:33,490
have a Wi-Fi as well so you immediately
are connected to land or internet and

237
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:39,250
you can make Internet of Things with
that huge help is of course software

238
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:46,240
stack which comes with a secure socket
layer also which is very much standard

239
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:54,220
these days for going to the internet and
making stuff access to the internet and

240
00:30:54,220 --> 00:31:07,210
it's easy to program networking on this
device but also some micro controller

241
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:16,270
regular stuff comes of the shelf as well
it's it's tis solution for for IT it has

242
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:22,960
a nice large bad collector so it can be
extended we extended it with a couple of

243
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,970
this what they call poster extension
boards and with one of them

244
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:36,559
we created the wireless microphone nodes
to be able to to record and stream

245
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,649
wirelessly and collect some audio data
on the server to process it and stuff

246
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:55,820
like that so then the famous cyprus this
is a little bit reader but cooler

247
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:03,710
technology it's called p soccer
programmable system-on-chip why they

248
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:09,679
call it like that if we're not sure but
i think its marketing system of chip

249
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,440
means that that this is a hitter again
is architecture where you have your

250
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:25,910
programming a core from the left is it
slow powerful a low-power device a bit

251
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:35,690
core with it with a call mr. Quan coming
over to pick five we have M 3 processor

252
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:44,900
which is really powerful but it was so
special about this is that it combines

253
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:50,870
conventional microcontroller and
processor stuff with something that is

254
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:59,209
also known as programming logic or or or
somebody's may be familiar with fpga

255
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:11,480
plus some cool analog electronics also
back there so you can create a op amps

256
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,410
and

257
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:20,900
the even voltage references mixers
digital filters and all that inside of

258
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:27,950
this chip without processing on a
microcontroller so everything that you

259
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:37,760
do here is within this digital system
and L analog system and then you can

260
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:47,120
design your reaction to some sense or to
some events for instance and turn off

261
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:55,280
your your microcontroller and be really
low power like that so I really need

262
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:02,690
technology comes with a pretty amazing
the commutation dotrice oh and some good

263
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:10,668
Toulon's its program graphically which
is appealing to some some folks

264
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:21,290
especially appealing to somebody that
worked on on this kind of a projects

265
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:27,980
where you are maybe building logic gates
and and and that kinda stuff which is

266
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:37,010
maybe the only rated effectively making
it can you that you can draw and and

267
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:44,450
build stuff but of course is the
downside for the makers it's it's lot of

268
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:51,500
complexity for somebody that is not so
experienced with electronic so somebody

269
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:59,210
coming to programming from electronics
side can maybe fancy this more than just

270
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:06,680
programming but again it's really really
need technology we want to mention it

271
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,279
because the

272
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,280
we build up some cool stuff with that as
well

273
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:22,980
we cannot go around famous local Wi-Fi
coming from in silica this is really

274
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:37,170
really famous famous chip popular almost
is a robbery . arduino but for the Wi-Fi

275
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:44,850
which is really low cost and again gives
you a full stack of of Connect wife

276
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:53,370
Wi-Fi connectivity and a lot of open
source projects of base them on this

277
00:35:53,370 --> 00:36:02,490
ship so there are really good community
and on open source material that you can

278
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:14,189
find it's decently powerful so you can
make a grid projects with it and you can

279
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:19,170
be amazed how people are using because
it's so tiny

280
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:24,870
they're hiding it in lot of stuff and
this is really enabling first cut of

281
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:33,480
these IOT business that that is
happening worldwide then being a make

282
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:42,240
and I learned really neat trick from for
my colleagues this also supports a

283
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,169
sketch or programming this through our
Dino tooling so you can start your

284
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:53,760
program by writing setup and loop it
pretty much you're connected to internet

285
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,990
and making connected stuff

286
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:09,720
Oh No on a really really kind of small
couple lines of code but library

287
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:16,709
underneath is really powerful it has
everything that you can think of and

288
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:25,080
it works we tried almost everything from
this and it really works

289
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:31,290
it's faster to to connect to internet
then ti for instance which is kind of

290
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:36,750
coming from a bigger company you can
expect being more kind of sleeping and

291
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:46,890
meet it has a new version PSP two came
recently is that part of the slides

292
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:54,150
that's that how we recently came so we
are going to definitely look into that

293
00:37:54,150 --> 00:38:04,230
in and see how how cool or how better it
is in comparison to the predecessor it's

294
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:11,100
really good for making because there are
some platforms that are based on this

295
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:18,839
trip promotion and no them see you for
instance that are really powerful and

296
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:26,790
off-the-shelf kind of support and and
building that the complex things and we

297
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:38,370
are having a lot of fun playing with
with these things then I'm of our one of

298
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:43,259
our favorites again everything is
favorably returns are toys too much

299
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:49,290
maybe this is this is particle following
started as a as a Kickstarter they have

300
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,720
a various devices

301
00:38:51,720 --> 00:39:00,750
well it's cheap in comparison to some
others about the trick is that it's a

302
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:07,980
whole stack solution so you're it comes
with with the cloud support as well and

303
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:16,980
they have even 2g 3G modem version of
this platform so you can be connected

304
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,618
even without Wi-Fi harder

305
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:27,410
I don't want to go into too much details
running out of time a little bit is also

306
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:38,359
powerful and and a lot of the pins that
did you can have in use and it's of

307
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:43,700
course breadboard compatible so it's
easy for making stuff but here's the

308
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:50,629
critical apart this is the cloud support
for you so when you buy a device you

309
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:57,440
also buy both access to to their cloud
services so you can connect your your

310
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:07,160
particle device to internet immediately
its programmed we are internet so it's

311
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:15,348
it's what they call over-the-air update
and the that's how you flash it so you

312
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:21,710
have to use an android application to
connect to it and tell it which why fire

313
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:28,250
once connected remembers up to five
anything or wifis and then you just have

314
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:34,190
to turn it on and it accessible /
internet anywhere it is and you can

315
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:41,030
reflash it reprogram it and play with it
comes with a with a powerful cloud

316
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:47,060
support with a powerful API of course of
Education securities there but what is

317
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:53,750
needed is that you can build really
easily functions and variables and react

318
00:40:53,750 --> 00:41:02,720
to events with a publish subscriber
pattern and look at the stream of events

319
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:12,348
and even work with the web books to make
something more best then a famous Laura

320
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:18,500
we played with it a little bit this is
when you don't have an if infrastructure

321
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:24,410
in one you want to build your own some
of the our members coming from

322
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:31,879
amateur radio world really fancying this
video it's really powerful it says that

323
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:43,370
it's having a range in urban area or 25
kilometers we measure that in urban area

324
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:51,080
but with run wrong and then actually and
got around two kilometers so you can see

325
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:58,790
that if it's big enough our experiments
where zone is driving a car around

326
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:05,420
around the city and testing the
equipment how how good it is and is it

327
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,010
still alive or not

328
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:15,890
recent story came from Intel called
Addison it's really really powerful and

329
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:20,240
it's becoming more and more popular in
the makers community

330
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:28,100
it comes with the XDK which is a little
bit weird acronym if you ask me but its

331
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:38,390
cross-platform development kit and it
breaks with with the latest the

332
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:45,319
low-energy Bluetooth of course and comes
with the with a good luck documentation

333
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:51,530
and and good development board so the
actual chip and and how they sell it is

334
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,530
this thing in in the left bottom corner

335
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,310
the rest is development board so when
you develop your IOT with a full second

336
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:09,710
and it can run linux as well so it's
really tiny and can be packed into a

337
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:17,810
tiny design they are trying to to say
that it's designed for variables

338
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:22,549
maybe it's too powerful for availables
you will have to have a backpack with a

339
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:28,880
bit early i think for this thing but if
you if you put it in in sleep often

340
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,579
maybe it can be available as well

341
00:43:31,579 --> 00:43:38,690
then we were be free go over some of the
cloud technologies and what we are doing

342
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:46,039
with them we cannot do that without
mentioning asia and some of the projects

343
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:52,339
that we did with Asia it comes with a
really powerful tool set one of them is

344
00:43:52,339 --> 00:44:00,229
IT Help where you can connect and manage
millions of your devices then it kicks

345
00:44:00,229 --> 00:44:07,249
in the stream analytics very can analyze
a big data and and in read real time

346
00:44:07,249 --> 00:44:10,129
process it of course

347
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:16,609
amazon is is a powerful cloud platform
where storage comes then something that

348
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:23,538
they could go or they call services and
logic apps which are pretty much glue

349
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:28,249
logic and integration parts of the of
this ecosystem where can integrate it

350
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:33,828
with the other stuff and really
interesting part is power bi where can

351
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:41,779
easily visualize your data and create a
dashboard from data collected from IT

352
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:42,469
device

353
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:47,900
this is a little bit of ovary or of the
architecture where devices on the left

354
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:55,519
are connected to iop hub and you can see
the the work flow of data here coming to

355
00:44:55,519 --> 00:45:01,519
string stream analytics and then even
Bob handling the advanced filtering them

356
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:07,038
and and normalizing diamond and and
doing other stuff than integration with

357
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:13,699
this web jobs web apps you can build
your available mobile apps and you can

358
00:45:13,699 --> 00:45:17,569
of course because it's microsoft is a or
always

359
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:25,759
organized and and and and open to
enterprises you can incorporate that in

360
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:34,790
erp and crm and then and that kind of a
larger business processes the second

361
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:36,860
player in this game is of course

362
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:47,840
amazon it's a really big platform and
cloud platform really popular for a lot

363
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:55,250
of a web-based development and
production they had their own IT

364
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:58,490
services

365
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:05,899
amazon web services for IOT this is a
overview of the service where can easily

366
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:15,170
define your device and connect it while
the rest api and then amazon part power

367
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:20,420
kicks in and making it really easy and
powerful in the same time for you to

368
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:27,800
organize your data and react on on
events coming from devices even for the

369
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,180
proper problems with the connectivity
where you don't have a good connection

370
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:38,060
they have a built-in support with
shadowing what is the state of of your

371
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:45,230
device and when it comes online it
updates itself and that way you don't

372
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:53,780
lose data we are realizing connection
you can pretty much defined your rules

373
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:59,930
and rule actions with clicking and
defining what will happen in this very

374
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:05,690
powerful rolling engine but of course
story data or integration with mobile

375
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,690
and web that's comes naturally

376
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:18,259
this is the important part of being a
for example of a bottom part being a hex

377
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:23,380
their community this is a amazon echo
device or

378
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:32,109
this alexa service where we had a
exclusive access to to this device even

379
00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:40,630
though we are outside of us so it's for
a controlling by voice you can play with

380
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:50,710
it in hall and it's open to to program
in and make some Alexis skills or

381
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,930
enhance your experience with it

382
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:58,629
this is in contrast to to some other
technologies these skills lucky

383
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:05,470
important because your code can be
downloaded to cloud and your code can

384
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:16,808
interact with recognized text and also
your code can playback text or playback

385
00:48:16,809 --> 00:48:28,839
voice to to user using this services but
ready to marry powerful then third

386
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:29,380
player

387
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:36,430
samsung they're announcing a long time
ago and came third but they are really

388
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:45,519
neat so this platform is really easy to
use in and very powerful you can define

389
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:50,288
your data and and have a connectivity
with your device in couple of minutes

390
00:48:50,289 --> 00:48:58,660
and there are two aspects of of this
record our cloud platform where you

391
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:04,839
define your data you are actually
defining your devices and then you

392
00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:09,970
switch on the other side in your
immediately can go into production and

393
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:14,470
share your definition of devices with
somebody else that will use this device

394
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:27,220
so it's again really easy to interact
Rottweiler rest of web or WebSockets we

395
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,700
played with it with

396
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:37,399
the Intel Edison and it's powerful
because it's easy to use in easy to go

397
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:45,200
to production they have up nice and
tiring or of prices where you can pretty

398
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:51,710
much my makers for free use this trial
and and testing tools to build your own

399
00:49:51,710 --> 00:50:04,130
IT solution more more about that you can
learn of course from taking i will be a

400
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:13,730
little bit shorter in this moment
running out of time then finally 3d

401
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:19,760
printing up were just left prepared
preparing probably start some of the

402
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:26,510
stuff for you two to play this is what
we have in our a small print what it's

403
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:38,510
simple potassium printer using this PLA
filaments and we are starting to to

404
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:44,329
learn about this and finally we can make
our robots in hands and all that

405
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:50,240
understand that we need to to be able to
physically make things and and make them

406
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:57,560
move polyhedra handbook and your card
there the whole for you so you can play

407
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:06,770
with them after this talk and we had
also friends from Romania announced that

408
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:11,900
they're come i'm not sure they're just
later or again having problems with

409
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:19,700
customs like this the time before but
maybe we will see this thing on the

410
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:24,980
right which is a different kind of
printer called Delta printer really

411
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:32,089
interesting no technology so pretty much
that we all of our toys or most of our

412
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:37,849
toys that they've replayed bit of i hope
that you find it interesting and I hold

413
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:38,530
it

414
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:46,090
that you would like to be a maker of the
distorted and maybe we sparkle some

415
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:48,760
somebody's idea in their head

416
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:57,010
we are they to to help for sure so this
is a Vulcan of course so i changed the

417
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:05,380
question is what will you hack a make so
it's it's up to you to be a maker there

418
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:12,580
is a community it's live it's or a
year-long we announce yourself on the

419
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:19,120
balcony and you see that we are really
active and we're there to help there to

420
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:24,700
have fun with you guys that will be all
for more information there are links

421
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,879
hope you enjoyed it thanks

422
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:39,330
yeah
