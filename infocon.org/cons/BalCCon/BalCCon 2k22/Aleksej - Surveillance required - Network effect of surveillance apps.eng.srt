00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,130
thank you

3
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,960
[Music]

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,140
okay guys it's time to start our next

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,580
topic will be surveillance required

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,980
network uh Network effects of

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,460
surveillance apps caused by Alexa

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,239
thank you thank you

9
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,680
ah hello hackers

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,739
all right so uh I'm going to give you a

11
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,140
little introduction but not too much I

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,760
like privacy that's pretty much all

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,039
You're Gonna Know About Me

14
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,399
so uh I I always like like privacy a lot

15
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,579
so I never really used uh social media a

16
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,940
lot or uh or when I did I would be so

17
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,160
paranoid that I would change my

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,960
passwords very frequently and eventually

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,880
I would forget the password

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,680
and because it's not connected to

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,100
anything else no phones so I would just

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,020
lose access to it and then I would just

23
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,180
think I'm not gonna I'm not gonna make a

24
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,600
new one so So eventually I stopped using

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,619
all these uh all these Technologies uh

26
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,680
like social media apps and even phone I

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,560
don't like to bring with me so I'm going

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,520
to tell you a little bit from my

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,780
perspective

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,080
uh how life is and what was the biggest

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,900
challenges in hopes to improve on those

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,280
it helps to have a a good focus on what

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,740
is what is the biggest problem really in

34
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,500
trying to live a private life

35
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,259
uh I I chose the name of the talk

36
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,060
surveillance required because it turns

37
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,540
out you it's not really optional to it's

38
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,640
not really opt out you know from

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,640
security from surveillance there is no

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,259
real way to do it

41
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,560
uh it turns out you have to you have to

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,619
use these apps but I'm gonna get into

43
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,840
that a little bit

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,000
later so I remember when Facebook came

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,220
to like Serbia it became popular back

46
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,480
then we didn't really think about

47
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,000
privacy too much it was just a fun

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,379
little thing

49
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,620
uh for everybody to connect to use

50
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,800
but then I was like I would figure out

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,480
to get into other people's Facebook

52
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,480
accounts it was it was I was very young

53
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,300
and security was really bad at the time

54
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,120
you could just guess passwords or use

55
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,560
the forget password the

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,900
forms and they will have some some

57
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,879
really easy questions even if you don't

58
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,620
know a person you uh security question

59
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,420
you could answer

60
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,599
uh and then I then I will get into other

61
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,160
people's Facebook account this is a long

62
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,720
time ago I don't do that anymore by the

63
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,000
way don't don't ask me how I don't think

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,900
I could anymore but uh I wouldn't anyway

65
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,459
I do value other people's privacy now

66
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,700
and back then not so much uh but then

67
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,220
again I didn't value my own so through

68
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,800
that what I'm telling you this is when I

69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,599
learned when I learned how important it

70
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,080
is to have uh to have a private life

71
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,659
so when I will get into other people's

72
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,819
accounts

73
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:26,519
I would figure out I I don't feel very

74
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,560
comfortable even reading it and I could

75
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,060
only imagine how I would feel if

76
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,300
somebody read mind that's when I stopped

77
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,700
uh when I stopped like hacking into

78
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,599
other people's accounts uh maybe I'll

79
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,159
Attack some servers but we're not going

80
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,739
to talk about it so but I wouldn't I

81
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,920
wouldn't go through for individuals

82
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,760
so it it turns out

83
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,239
you can't really just delete Facebook I

84
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,480
mean you can do it of course but it

85
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,879
turns out schools more and more require

86
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,220
it like at my University

87
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,980
it's very disorganized University you

88
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,920
don't really know uh when classes are

89
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,980
that easily when they start until you go

90
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,980
to like uh their Facebook group for

91
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,560
students uh

92
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,238
but I don't have a Facebook account so

93
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,519
they've created a lot of problems uh for

94
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,220
me so I used to be able just to go there

95
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,800
you know even without an account but

96
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,199
over time you may be noticed you need to

97
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,479
be logged in you know so I tried

98
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,440
creating a Anonymous accounts locked in

99
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,120
Serbia you don't need an ID to buy a

100
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,240
phone and even though most apps now

101
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,180
require it even though Facebook requires

102
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,120
it Gmail account requires it

103
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,120
uh you can still get a dumb phone you

104
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,440
can create an account and you can throw

105
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,479
it away

106
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,520
but what I didn't expect to happen is

107
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,560
that after like a week they delete your

108
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,340
account

109
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,139
now they figure it out maybe you're not

110
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,300
posting enough or something they're not

111
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,460
getting enough data and they just choose

112
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,780
to uh

113
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,840
to remove it uh

114
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,960
so uh it turns out

115
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,580
we can't really live a life without

116
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,359
social media

117
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,199
foreign

118
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,180
but sure as hell I'm gonna try I'm gonna

119
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,460
try try some more I want to try to

120
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,660
figure out the way

121
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,460
so

122
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,740
what I noticed

123
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,600
is a

124
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,940
securing your own devices of course it's

125
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,500
not it's not completely easy you know

126
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,259
you can't own a smartphone I don't

127
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,900
um there is no real good way around it I

128
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,360
have a pine phone maybe you heard of it

129
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,639
uh it's like it's a it's a Linux one

130
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,820
it's basically like a little computer uh

131
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,460
and and it works great on its own you

132
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,620
can figure out even if they're like some

133
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,919
bugs in some software you you can fix

134
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,979
everything maybe a week or two the most

135
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,080
but what you can't fix is you can't fix

136
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,600
other people you can't fix uh if you

137
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,560
can't find anybody on your on on your uh

138
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,900
private on your apps they choose privacy

139
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,240
there's no point of them there's no

140
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,840
point of having social media nobody uses

141
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,160
uh

142
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,840
so

143
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,199
so I feel I figured out

144
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,880
I figure out the solution the solutions

145
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,639
of course is to use open protocols apps

146
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,280
with open protocols so a lot of people

147
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,940
here and generally that are more they've

148
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,940
learned about privacy uh they they

149
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,759
usually go to Signal or they use or they

150
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,100
go to maybe protonmail or some of these

151
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,860
still pretty much centralized services

152
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,960
uh the problem with it is even if it's

153
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,020
private even if all this is true being

154
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,660
centralized means you can get kicked out

155
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,680
you can be logged out of it at any time

156
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,419
unfortunately it happened to me I got

157
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,340
locked out of signal and you need a

158
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,860
smartphone to get a QR code to scan it

159
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,259
again I'm not going to buy another

160
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:03,060
smartphone just to be logged out again

161
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,919
for whatever reason so it turns out

162
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:11,340
there are a lot of course

163
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,000
Alternatives you know xmpp or jabber as

164
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,259
it used to be called is one of them

165
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:21,660
Matrix I think retroshare heard Breyer

166
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,520
even

167
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,740
these are like I think open protocols at

168
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,319
least the XMP and Matrix are the good

169
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,819
thing about them when it's an open

170
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:30,800
protocol

171
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,319
and what that means is

172
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,960
there's a set of rules the the app needs

173
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,800
to follow and it it's not it's not

174
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,840
compliant it's not part of the protocol

175
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,220
if it doesn't

176
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,919
uh what ends up happening is that you

177
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,940
need to have apps that are working the

178
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,860
way they were intended for a very long

179
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,819
time

180
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,160
so you can create Bridges so you can

181
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,680
create from one protocol

182
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,300
to connect to the other so you can

183
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,699
create a matrix to jabber Bridge jabber

184
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,319
to email Bridge email is also an open

185
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,240
protocol with all its flaws I mean it

186
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,639
was created in the 70s it was I think

187
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,259
technically before the internet I think

188
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,800
it had its root in arpanet uh it you

189
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,419
know you can't see if somebody's online

190
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,699
you can of course chat in real time it

191
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,220
has a lot of security issues and whatnot

192
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,220
but it's still an open protocol and you

193
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,120
can still

194
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,280
make bridges you can still if somebody

195
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,460
uses an email you can still use whatever

196
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,458
app you want like XM like jabber or

197
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,700
Matrix and you can still talk to them

198
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,440
or at least you have the ability to

199
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,020
write a code for it which is usually not

200
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,479
as difficult uh

201
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,300
as as just trying to get other people to

202
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,100
switch

203
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,240
to your app

204
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,660
so I I got I started thinking about this

205
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,180
a little bit more and figured out it's

206
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,459
having one open protocol app is pretty

207
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,040
much having all of them

208
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,720
they can all get interconnected but

209
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,300
having anything that's closed

210
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,740
decentralized it's always on its own

211
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,080
signal is signal WhatsApp is what's up

212
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,820
libraries Viber

213
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,220
if if your friends are on two different

214
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,260
platforms

215
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,959
and that's it you can't they can't talk

216
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,640
to each other

217
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,019
um

218
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,000
so even though there is technological

219
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,399
solutions to these issues

220
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,380
the problems are

221
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,019
on a social scale that is the the

222
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,360
biggest difference we can write code for

223
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,980
anything it's not a problem these

224
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,660
technologies that I mentioned they're

225
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,839
very old like xmpp is like in the 90s I

226
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,899
think in the late 90s it's security

227
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,240
because it's extensible

228
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,160
it got better it's at the level of

229
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,820
signal they use the same protocol

230
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,580
that is used in signal the technical

231
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,459
parts are not the difficult ones it

232
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,560
turns out it's the human is the human

233
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,480
element that's the difficult I think

234
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,100
probably it's the marketing you know

235
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,899
like people hear about these other apps

236
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,660
and these open protocols nobody's really

237
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,480
you know nobody is marketing like hey

238
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,360
use email you know hey use driver so I

239
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,920
think that's I think that's where we

240
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,440
come in I think that is our

241
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,779
responsibility it's our job to go around

242
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,380
and to tell people uh to switch to any

243
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,360
app I will not we don't need to tell

244
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,019
them

245
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,800
uh to even make a full you know

246
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,620
transition to delete your WhatsApp and

247
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,200
to delete Viber and whatever and

248
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,380
Facebook uh that is individual privacy I

249
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,700
think we need to make that this

250
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,839
distinction

251
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,420
so a lot of us

252
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,800
I assume we hear how to secure our own

253
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,380
devices how to secure our own

254
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,500
um

255
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,320
around conversations but

256
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,920
it turns out I I think at least that it

257
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,980
is far more important to allow others to

258
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,839
secure themselves and I think we're not

259
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,600
doing that by not being available on one

260
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,700
of these open protocol apps luckily we

261
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,200
still have email but I mean of course

262
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,500
it's very limited protocol uh I think

263
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,779
we're we're doing a great D service to

264
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:13,620
the

265
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,500
to everybody who might need privacy and

266
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,060
unfortunately there are people who

267
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,459
really really need it journalists and

268
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,560
some in some countries opposition

269
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,380
leaders maybe even in this country so if

270
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,600
people need people need problems there

271
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,040
are people you might not need privacy

272
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,019
but there are people who need it and

273
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,600
it's more important I think not to

274
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,519
secure yourself as much as to be

275
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,100
available on on apps that allow other

276
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,940
people's to use them uh anonymously or

277
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,800
privately or securely

278
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,620
so that's pretty much it I don't need to

279
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,740
I can go into details I can go into a

280
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,980
my experiences with all these things I I

281
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,920
can tell you uh

282
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,740
how well I can I could try to explain to

283
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,820
you how it feels to like for a few years

284
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,040
uh to try to live it's not tough to grid

285
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,459
but just try to not even make sure that

286
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,819
you are

287
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,500
that your conversations are encrypted

288
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,480
but just to make sure that

289
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,399
at least your location is not

290
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,399
is not compromised or maybe not the

291
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,560
location but like at least you don't

292
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,200
have a device in your home that has the

293
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,079
ability to listen to you at any time

294
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,180
uh the thing is when you have a

295
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,880
smartphone whether it's Android whether

296
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,160
it's Apple uh there's somebody else who

297
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,740
has like Rude access to your account to

298
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,500
your device they have a complete

299
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,279
uh access you can always bypass you they

300
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,899
can always listen to you

301
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,600
and it might be fine for you A lot of

302
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,060
people say I don't care and maybe you

303
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,279
maybe people here do care but your

304
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,279
friends they might not care that much if

305
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,380
somebody is listening to them but what

306
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,420
I'm trying to uh to really put an

307
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,040
emphasis on here

308
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,980
is that there are people that do need it

309
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,540
and we need to allow them

310
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,680
allow them space to talk to us

311
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,920
that would be pretty much it but of

312
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,320
course if you have any questions or any

313
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,639
uh

314
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,519
any thoughts of your own any experiences

315
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,139
or

316
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,000
anything to add I would be happy to

317
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,980
listen uh go ahead

318
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,279
uh

319
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,040
hi uh what about hardware and privacy

320
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,160
because every CPUs Black Box Etc yeah

321
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,579
yeah so what the focus on this talk is

322
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,079
of course

323
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,300
there's a lot of security issues that we

324
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,519
have it's you cannot solve all of it

325
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,220
yourself especially Hardware that is

326
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,880
true but uh the reason I made this talk

327
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,800
is that even though I hear all the time

328
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
about how to secure yourself

329
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,959
uh we don't hear that much about you

330
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,180
know the like a group so social privacy

331
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,100
and for that it doesn't matter really

332
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,839
what Hardware you're using what matters

333
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,680
is that you allow somebody a protocol

334
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,720
you understand something abstract

335
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,320
something uh something above it so they

336
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,240
can talk to you on your device whatever

337
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,240
device you are using uh of course this

338
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,160
is not going to solve all the issues

339
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,360
you're not going to probably solve any

340
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,000
issues just being available on one of

341
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,459
these apps but it is I think a necessary

342
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,959
start it is you we can't we need a step

343
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,440
uh we need a step uh a first step to

344
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,199
allow for for a new network to grow if

345
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,260
we are even even if our only goal is to

346
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,839
like switch from from these uh from

347
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,620
these apps uh we need to have

348
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,139
we need to have a little Network that in

349
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:08,100
Elites at least start why why I uh name

350
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,260
this stock uh it wasn't just

351
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,300
surveillance required it was also a

352
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,100
network effect of it so Network effect

353
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,980
if you're not familiar with the term uh

354
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,040
it describes the problem of uh well it's

355
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,800
not just a problem it's a it describes

356
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,420
the fact that like the bigger network is

357
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,100
more valuable because he has more people

358
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,380
in it he has more uh nodes in it that's

359
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,380
the value of the network

360
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,180
so if you have nobody on it there's no

361
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,199
point of

362
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:39,480
of uh you can't switch to to Matrix or

363
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,360
to drag or if nobody is using it but

364
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,639
luckily we don't need to just make a

365
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,560
switch all together we don't need to all

366
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,600
organize together and we say okay from

367
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,600
tomorrow we all use Matrix we can we can

368
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,639
just be available on it first I think

369
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,959
that's the first step

370
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,160
uh

371
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,740
so I really went down a little bit from

372
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,320
this question you are thank you thank

373
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,699
you for reminding me all the things that

374
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,160
maybe haven't said

375
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,839
um anybody else has something to add

376
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:11,399
by the way maybe you'll notice on this

377
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,380
little presentation that I have anything

378
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,980
to say just pictures yeah I just want to

379
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,680
say can you share these slides yeah yeah

380
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,320
I'll share

381
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,699
these pictures are except this one

382
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:26,579
they're all AI generated from I just

383
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,019
thought it was cool

384
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,540
so I just I just placed him I had a

385
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,120
little bit text before but I thought uh

386
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,160
nice but it's better for me to improvise

387
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,060
a little bit uh so and the pictures are

388
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,579
just so you can look at something

389
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:44,519
yeah that's it is there any questions

390
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,920
anybody by the way I can show you how to

391
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,959
make one of these apps now if we still

392
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,019
have time I assume we do uh

393
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,720
what do you say when a girl asks you for

394
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,360
your Instagram

395
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,980
I say sorry I can give you my email

396
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,980
people are people usually say no thank

397
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,419
you

398
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,000
it's fine we're just not sharing contact

399
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,760
information usually they see okay he's

400
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,780
weird we don't wanna

401
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,959
yeah yeah

402
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,579
I can show you by the way uh if you

403
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,559
never heard of jabber I do I even you

404
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,119
have Matrix I'll show you a little bit

405
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,799
how it looks like

406
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,679
if you have the time uh of course it's

407
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,080
just few minutes of creating it

408
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,120
uh so this is just how it looks like

409
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,700
it's a it's a gadget map of course being

410
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,260
an open protocol you can have many

411
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,140
different apps uh guardium is I think

412
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,340
the most popular desktop app

413
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,799
I don't know if Dino is just a desktop

414
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,200
app or is it on the phone on your phones

415
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,320
there's a very for Android it's a very

416
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,320
popular one oh sorry I don't have

417
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,179
maybe I need to uh okay it works

418
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,220
so the good thing about it is it all

419
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,220
works over tour I really like uh hiding

420
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,260
behind Thor maybe it's not perfect

421
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,960
privacy but my my ideologies make it

422
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,900
harder make it harder for them you don't

423
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,820
need to be perfect just make it hard

424
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,940
enough

425
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,220
don't type

426
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,460
so so there you go uh how you can create

427
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,260
is you can actually create it from the

428
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,600
app

429
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,919
you can go modify account add an account

430
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,419
uh and then you put the username and the

431
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:39,000
uh being a federalized it has like the

432
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,600
same address like uh email you know it's

433
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,419
a local part like a user at something so

434
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:46,860
you can have

435
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,720
uh you can have many different servers

436
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,880
uh

437
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,400
uh but

438
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,100
but I like to pick a random one I think

439
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,960
that's the best for uh decentralization

440
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,480
I think Matrix had an issue where all

441
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,780
most of its users created a matrix

442
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,820
accounted on their like first instance

443
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,700
on their like uh main instance I don't

444
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,320
know what's called matrix.org or

445
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,100
something

446
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,919
and then when it fell down like 70 of

447
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,120
the network went down or something like

448
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,299
that that's not the but of course that's

449
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,179
something where people learn from

450
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,600
and they make an account somewhere else

451
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,559
as well

452
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,080
but uh

453
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,299
uh but it's good to start like that as

454
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,280
well to pick a random server I'll just

455
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,660
find you some lists you can find them

456
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,799
anywhere maybe just

457
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,660
um yeah there's one

458
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,740
I think there's also website accentp.net

459
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm just going to show you random

460
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,960
service because I don't want to

461
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,700
recommend you a specific one

462
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,380
uh

463
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,120
not because I'm afraid that it's not

464
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,320
going to work or something but because

465
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,340
uh

466
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,200
if everybody's using the same one it's

467
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,580
pretty much the

468
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,980
uh you're just gonna have to switch once

469
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,799
it a lot of you when it went down so

470
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,960
these are what like some of them some of

471
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,539
them have registration over uh

472
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,380
over just a website

473
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,820
it requires really just username and

474
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,320
password that's it

475
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,780
uh maybe we can create it with some of

476
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,700
them I haven't tried these let me try

477
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,799
this one

478
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,340
so maybe we can go maybe we can add here

479
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,899
say Galaxy at

480
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,820
jab is that one oh yes sign up sorry

481
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,740
so you pick a server first I think maybe

482
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,360
even Garden you have a little list oh

483
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,039
there you go

484
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,760
I just pick a random let's go with this

485
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,160
I like to add the

486
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,640
tour

487
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,580
I suggest you do this as well

488
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,919
the more of us you store the more

489
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,320
private we are will oh no sorry this is

493
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,480
you should maybe they thought no

494
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,840

499
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,440
so of course sometimes they put a little

500
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,059
capture not like those Google captures

501
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,100
with like traffic lights that annoy me

502
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,900
so much because I by the way only use

503
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,500
like Tor Browser so uh yeah I get a lot

504
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,960
of those captures I really hate it I

505
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,600
it's the worst part of being private is

506
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,620
solving a lot of characters

507
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,059
unfortunately

508
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,740
uh

509
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,340
sometimes maybe their address for their

510
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,220
xmpp server is a little bit different

511
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,840
and this one oh they even have a tour

512
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,500
one I think

513
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,440
the Avatar uh oh yeah there we go

514
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,720
even better we don't have to exit the

515
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,919
tour Network

516
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,780
so the exit nodes are not going to

517
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,520
create any issues for us

518
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,919
uh

519
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,960
so for for Apple if you're using Apple

520
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,600
One Apple phone whatever it's called

521
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,419
iPhone

522
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:38,880
uh I think there's a app called Mono or

523
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,140
something like that

524
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,360
there's also an app called Dino I think

525
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,159
it's I'm not even sure if it's for phone

526
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,000
or

527
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,240
but for for for for Android there's an

528
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,880
app called conversations uh the problem

529
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,299
with it

530
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,120
um

531
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,179
maybe it was a different part

532
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,820
uh no all right maybe it's a better

533
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,640
just pick another one

534
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,900
uh

535
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,360
for uh Matrix I think they have on their

536
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,240
website like a huge list of clients but

537
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,299
I use this quaterion one

538
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,400
uh the good thing about it is it's the

539
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,240
only one that uh that can actually uh

540
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,780
work over tour

541
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,120
but it's a little bit I don't like the

542
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,460
way the way the way Matrix works as much

543
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,980
that's what I use the xmpp is it's very

544
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,220
like web-based you need to go to a

545
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,200
website to create an account

546
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,620
in all cases pretty much

547
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,600
uh and this this is the only client that

548
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,760
like supports Thor and it doesn't

549
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,860
support like I think encryption or

550
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,820
something

551
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,059
it's really uh

552
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,980
oh this is in track maybe not a good

553
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,179
server to pick

554
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:04,679
I don't know

555
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,020
oh there you go I think I can imagine

556
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,059
manage with this

557
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,700
oh they think they host a lot of them or

558
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,880
something

559
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,220
this is

560
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:32,100
now this is the best way to actually

561
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,440
tell you about my experience you just

562
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,380
look at it what it's like using tor

563
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,539
solve buses with me please

564
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,340
I'm really bad at this

565
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,460
even even after all these years

566
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,200
apparently I can't figure out what's a

567
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,200
bus and what's not the bus

568
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,140
you see I'm really bad I don't know

569
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,880
I think I think they're messing with me

570
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,679
I don't think they're I think that I

571
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,240
think I always pick the right one but

572
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,580
they always they're like nah

573
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,899
here's your punishment

574
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,400
um

575
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,080
I hope that's it

576
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,740
yeah yeah

577
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,480
so it's there you go and just register

578
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,159
this one was our web

579
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,360
some of them are all because the X in

580
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,940
xmpp stands for extensible so so they

581
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,360
added a lot of ways for registration or

582
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,460
for uh

583
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,460
uh

584
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,919
well for many things really I mean

585
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,200
that's how they added the that's how

586
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,980
they added the

587
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,539
um sorry I can't do two things at once

588
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:43,679
so I can't stop talking and typing

589
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,080
oh yeah so so that's where they added

590
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,539
like signal encryption so easily

591
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,980
is because it's extensible

592
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,039
uh the reason it doesn't work often for

593
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,940
me

594
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,679
as you're seeing now

595
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,260
is probably because uh

596
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,779
I'm too lazy to to find the right oh

597
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,940
there you go it works

598
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,860
on the way I think I'm registering now

599
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,940
again

600
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,380
no I don't want to do that I already

601
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,419
made one

602
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:18,720
uh Alexa at

603
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,440
try everything

604
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,460
should work now

605
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,720
it's a little bit slow because I'm using

606
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Tori has not to do it

607
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,820
there you go it works

608
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,520
you have a new account now

609
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,720
it's right there so it

610
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,220
xmpp allows for multiple

611
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,720
Gathering sorry allows for multiple

612
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,240
accounts of course

613
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,220
so there you go I can use the server

614
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,600
another server

615
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,779
uh so here's the Matrix is for some

616
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:00,480
reason you prefer Matrix I don't

617
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,700
there's some hacker spaces

618
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,220
that are on Matrix in Serbia hacker

619
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,380
spaces are usually on xmpp well I know

620
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,940
only have two of them really

621
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,840
uh uh the one in office in Belgrade both

622
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,120
on xmpp

623
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,580
these ones uh

624
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,600
these ones are thinking Croatia

625
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,460
this one is I think in Hungary Cocker

626
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,919
space this is like just

627
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:26,580
crackerspaces.org I think a list of

628
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,740
hacker spaces this is in Slovenia

629
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,059
because it's probably somebody from

630
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:32,159
Slovenia here from this group this is

631
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,600
where is welcome

632
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,480
oh I think that's my time I kind of show

633
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,940
you a little bit more than I actually uh

634
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,620
because we didn't have any questions so

635
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:45,539
I showed you a little bit more that's it

636
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,200
thank you
