00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:12,710
[Music]

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,130
thank you

3
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,640
[Music]

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,220
all right welcome everybody to the final

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,640
and most anticipated Talk of the night

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,859
give it up for Mac lemon and USB how

7
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,579
does it even work

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,280
thank you

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,100
thank you it's so good to be back at

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,719
Falcon

11
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,739
um

12
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,300
I'm probably not the only one who has

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,280
missed this place a lot in the recent

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,059
past uh yeah I make lemon you can find

15
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,820
me on the interwebs so I heard there's

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,680
pictures of me from past balcon so

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,140
I'm the one who foolishly thought to

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,600
make a talk about usb

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,240
then I recognize no this is probably

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,400
like a two months Workshop worth of

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,280
content so I

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,820
limit this to a very foundational piece

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,280
so that you know which Rabbit Hole to

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,200
follow in the future

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,320
and after this talk I'll be known as the

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,900
guy behind the karaoke mixer so it's all

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,820
my fault

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,159
if you want to use social media please

29
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,439
use these hashtags so others can find

30
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,080
what exactly you're ranting about

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,880
and so that I can get a feel for the

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,759
audience who of you has used USB this is

33
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,079
not a drug test

34
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,659
this is about technology or do you know

35
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,020
someone who has done USB in their past

36
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,060
okay I see a few hands I'm very

37
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,740
interested in where the people live and

38
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,659
how they live who have not shown a hand

39
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,920
now because how do you avoid this stuff

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,840
um yeah USB

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,780
it's an abbreviation in Computing it

42
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,439
says Universal serial bus a standardized

43
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,759
technology

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,860
for attaching peripheral devices to a

45
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,598
computer

46
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,760
is it

47
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,000
well how and that does it does it even

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,260
work

49
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,720
so we'll set the foundation for that

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,520
computers

51
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,920
in the past there weren't that many of

52
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,239
them

53
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,840
and everything was good but somehow the

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,459
thing caught on people started using

55
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,080
them more and people started to connect

56
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,940
external peripherals to computers

57
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,959
so suddenly there was a need for

58
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,319
receptacles or sockets plugs that go

59
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,239
into those circuits and wires that

60
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,060
connect those things together

61
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,800
so what do you need to for connecting

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,120
two devices together you need an

63
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,140
interface

64
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,180
an interface is a connection between two

65
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,580
pieces of electronic equipment or

66
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,680
between a person and a computer

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,680
it's also an interface and it usually is

68
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,900
comprised of a technical part meaning a

69
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,480
physical specification of a socket of a

70
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,080
plug of electrical connectors

71
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,540
and the wires in between and some kind

72
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,420
of protocol a spoken language that is

73
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,220
common among the devices so they can

74
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,000
understand each other

75
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,280
interfaces can be unidirectional meaning

76
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,319
they're one way only they can be

77
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,360
bi-directional meaning they go both ways

78
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,680
back and forth

79
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,500
and the current reality is that pretty

80
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,459
much every interface is bi-directional

81
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,120
so what kind of interfaces what use

82
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,680
cases for interfaces do we have with

83
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,900
computers most simple one you can think

84
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,760
of is text input

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,360
a way to get some kind of text into a

86
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,640
computer usually a keyboard people were

87
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,140
used to keyboards and because of

88
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,819
typewriters before them

89
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:54,000
and it's been shown to be quite an

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,500
efficient way to cut text into a

91
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,000
computer so once it's in there you

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,980
usually do something with it and want to

93
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,299
get it out again

94
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,879
in the past this was a printer maybe an

95
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,459
impact printer uh

96
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,200
chain printer ball head printers

97
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,700
something like that page printer and or

98
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,920
even a pen plotter you know those ones

99
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,780
with large sheets of paper that draw

100
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,820
lines

101
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,680
very nice if you have an old HP pen

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,079
plotter hold it there they're awesome

103
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,780
machines and later there followed

104
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,600
monitors and TV screens so like

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,180
projectors like we use now

106
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,180
then there's storage typing in is nice

107
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,639
getting it out again it's nice as well

108
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,380
but in between if you shut down the

109
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,120
computer you'll need to some way to

110
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,100
persist what you typed in that input

111
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,139
it's very convenient because it saves

112
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,400
you a lot of work

113
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,400
so you need the storage interface that's

114
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,199
of course bi-directional you can read

115
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,120
from it you can write to it

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,060
one of the most commonly known one is

117
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,139
Kazi the small computer systems

118
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,820
interface small meaning a storage device

119
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,860
that is smaller than the average washing

120
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,740
machine at your home back then and this

121
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,900
is one of the very handy

122
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,500
um

123
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,660
multi-purpose cables you can not only

124
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,820
clean computers with it if somebody

125
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,620
misbehaves in the data center you can

126
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,660
get rid of them with this as well

127
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,680
depends on where you put it but yeah

128
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,300
other storage devices you may have heard

129
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,960
of are like these ones lots of floppy

130
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,300
Drive 3.5 inches so one of the later

131
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,000
ones

132
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,320
and you may have heard of zip drives

133
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,440
Jazz drives side quests all those weird

134
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,100
things from the 80s and 90s

135
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,039
is worth a thing back then

136
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,720
um

137
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,840
so Windows Microsoft Windows and the

138
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,220
operating system still carries that

139
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,600
Legacy

140
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,699
because why is your internal hard drive

141
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,919
called c as a drive letter

142
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,919
yes floppies for a and b drives

143
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,320
and C is your hard drive so we still see

144
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,960
that Legacy today

145
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,940
but we're focusing on external devices

146
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,740
not internal once floppies were internal

147
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,000
back then

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,160
um and there's some

149
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,320
Optical input you would like this is

150
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,080
usually known as a camera or scanner

151
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,759
to get some

152
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,400
photo input like photons detecting in a

153
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,900
meaningful way and making an image out

154
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,539
of it so flatbed scanners slide scanners

155
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,840
all these things you may remember Lino

156
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,960
type or Heidelberg if you've been into

157
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,060
pre-press and producing papers or

158
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,900
magazines like this high with a large

159
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,380
glass tube it costs a fortune like a

160
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,460
house

161
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,100
and it was slow as hell

162
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,139
but it produced decent quality back then

163
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,780
and still compared today it's decent

164
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,819
quality these devices also use scuzzy

165
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,380
like hard drives

166
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,300
then there's this weird category of

167
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,919
barcode scanners they're actually two

168
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,380
devices one that scans the barcode and

169
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,680
interprets the bar data into numbers or

170
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,259
letters and then there's the output part

171
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,360
which is usually acting like a keyboard

172
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,400
so basically if you scan a barcode it

173
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,080
types in what it reads so that's

174
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,300
actually two devices in one

175
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,580
they've been using many different

176
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,460
connectors we'll get into that also

177
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,960
interesting motion input

178
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,080
if a person moves for example with a

179
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,599
mouse or a track bar do you want to

180
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,520
translate that motion input into some

181
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,139
kind of pointer

182
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,500
so that's also interesting

183
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,240
um you may have used one of these in

184
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,220
your past joystick

185
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,979
like many other joysticks this one has a

186
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,919
flat base to be safe and suction cups so

187
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,758
it doesn't wobble around

188
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,780
um

189
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,860
so yeah basically any kind of

190
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,740
specialized input device will

191
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,800
use motion input in some way networking

192
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,319
because computers do not only talk to

193
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,419
other devices in peripherals they also

194
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,759
talk to computers

195
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,319
so

196
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,599
what are the charge hits from the 70s

197
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:11,160
80s and 90s regarding connector types

198
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,340
well there's the sub miniature or d-sub

199
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,280
connector you might have seen those like

200
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,759
this D15 it's been used on monitors the

201
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,520
other end is

202
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,620
RGB sync component

203
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,099
so this was a very odd cable

204
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,760
or just a D15 Monitor to Monitor that's

205
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
not VGA

206
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,979
but you can use VGA as well that's a

207
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,580
standard 19 pin VGA connector with

208
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,679
something else on the other side to

209
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,339
connect some kind of display output

210
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,820
and regarding the connectors there's I

211
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,260
guess around

212
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,660
15 different variants of those

213
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,080
connectors and they've been around since

214
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,420
1915 because they have been used in

215
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,620
cinemas

216
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,740
for connecting audio when they started

217
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,680
with film projection that actually had

218
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,260
an audio track after you had a person at

219
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,240
the piano playing to the movie

220
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,100
so these connectors are really old but

221
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,200
they're still used and we've seen many

222
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,779
different styles of uses for the same

223
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,160
connector

224
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,720
because this

225
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,320
db25 it's used in parallel ports

226
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,839
like that one it's used in scuzzy drives

227
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,420
for storage it's been used for serial

228
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,800
connections

229
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,240
but it's all the same mechanical

230
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,440
connector

231
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,480
not electrically though

232
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,000
so yeah parallel ports also known as

233
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,500
centronics which is actually the company

234
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,240
that invented that port

235
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,959
it's from the early 70s

236
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,080
1970s that is at least

237
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,000
and they were also used for

238
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,480
serial connections and many other things

239
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,440
register check rj11 and RJ45 being the

240
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,019
most recognizable ones there

241
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,300
um rj11 was used for connecting

242
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,000
keyboards to computers

243
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,459
but also for telephones but who would

244
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,320
ever think of connecting a computer to a

245
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,660
telephone why would you need that no you

246
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,220
can't mix them up surely that is not a

247
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,300
problem

248
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,440
and

249
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,120
they were relatively available they were

250
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,080
cheap

251
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,019
you could just use them

252
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,940
and

253
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,700
RJ45 yes it was used for keyboards not

254
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,940
only for ethernet and ISDN

255
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,459
so Digital Phone networks and many other

256
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:33,380
things

257
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,880
then there's the famous Dean connector

258
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,120
Dean meaning Deutsche Industries German

259
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,660
standards body for plug connectors these

260
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,800
are the

261
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,519
these these quite large bulky round ones

262
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,860
and they come in 11 variants

263
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,959
at least the standardized ones there's

264
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,320
proprietary ones on top of that

265
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,880
so I mean you can use them for keyboards

266
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,220
as well

267
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,380
like graphical scanners that would

268
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,000
detect your Electron Beam on a monitor

269
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,100
on an analog monitor barcode scanners

270
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,640
midi so you could hook up a piano via a

271
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,519
ding connector via MIDI you can find one

272
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,019
of The Ataris that has this connectors

273
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,060
in the Once Upon a bite exhibition they

274
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,380
should go there it's very interesting

275
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,380
and there's also mini Dean which is a

276
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,600
smaller variant of that

277
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,440
um

278
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,079
probably look something like you cannot

279
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,700
see from behind there because it's way

280
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,839
too small

281
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,399
and

282
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,899
speaking of a standard there's a little

283
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,839
of a stretch because it's not really

284
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,600
formally standardized at least it's

285
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,300
highly disputed who and when this was

286
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,800
actually standardized because I could

287
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,560
absolutely not find anything to it

288
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,480
and the German standards body has no

289
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,279
documentation on having ever

290
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,000
standardized disconnector so that's odd

291
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,820
but it's used in variants from different

292
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,339
numbers of pins like three to nine and

293
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,860
some other ones and they're used in

294
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,079
apple networking local talk

295
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,120
3D shutter glasses for your 3D movie

296
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,800
experience

297
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,440
s video analog video

298
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,959
keyboards like PS2 and apple ADB

299
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:13,560
keyboards if you have a vacuum a Roomba

300
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,160
Vacuum like an automated robot that

301
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,100
cleans your floor they have a mini thin

302
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,320
serial connection on board proprietary

303
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,959
and some ham radio and modem equipment

304
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,640
also use them

305
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,279
so we're having quite a large collection

306
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,860
of connectors by now and some were used

307
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,779
for many different use cases so this is

308
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,640
certainly the Land of Confusion

309
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,260
especially if you wanted to hook up some

310
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,140
peripheral to a computer hey it fits

311
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,079
and if you're lucky nothing happens if

312
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,820
you're unlucky you have a smoke machine

313
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,680
or two

314
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,500
at worst and as you've seen with this

315
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,980
cable they're not exactly nice to carry

316
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,380
around or because people were carrying

317
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,959
hard drives around with size

318
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,720
because that's all was all they had so

319
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,459
yeah these cables are not really

320
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,440
nice to handle

321
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,420
and most of these ports were not hot

322
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,579
pluggable so the officials causes

323
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,339
implementations as well if you make any

324
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:12,899
change to the chain because you could

325
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,000
change these devices together in a row

326
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,160
you can make any change to that you need

327
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,500
to shut down everything make the change

328
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,360
and then boot up again

329
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,100
of course adventurous Natures were like

330
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,959
um hang on I'll just

331
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,820
plug this in there and then have some

332
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,260
special software to re-initialize the

333
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,380
bus and this worked mostly

334
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,779
it was not officially supported so if we

335
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,820
do like an overview chart of what was

336
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,560
used where you don't actually need to

337
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,060
read it it's like pretty much every

338
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,979
connector was used for almost everything

339
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:49,139
except probably for the 3.5 millimeter

340
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:50,880
audio jack that's

341
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,040
mostly a thing of the past sadly by now

342
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,800
so we've identified a problem a quite

343
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,260
large problem it's does not make sense

344
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,320
to use it's pretty annoying to learn

345
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,959
what thing does what and what works with

346
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,820
what else

347
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,839
so 30-ish connector types of multiple

348
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,399
variants each

349
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,740
we should make a standard

350
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,959
one that incorporates all the other ones

351
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,240
so we can come up with something that

352
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,980
works for everyone does it sound

353
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,440
familiar obligatory asks kcd quote here

354
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,120
that is 927

355
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,000
you should need to read that you should

356
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,360
know that I see nodding faces yeah so

357
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,820
um what to do about it well

358
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,880
as the third panel says there are now

359
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,100
one more competing standards for

360
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,779
connecting peripherals this is what

361
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,519
happened so in the United States of

362
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,980
America in about 1994 a bunch of

363
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,560
companies got together and said let's do

364
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,120
something about this make this easier

365
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,040
for users

366
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,899
um namely this was digital Equipment

367
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,839
Corporation or Tech

368
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,279
um they were later bought by a company

369
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,440
called Compaq if you might remember that

370
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,560
one compact itself was on that team as

371
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,320
well they got bought by HP

372
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,360
there was Nortel they went bankrupt in

373
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,820
2013 so we're off to a good start with

374
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,440
participation here

375
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,459
and then there's Intel IBM NEC and

376
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,079
Microsoft

377
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:22,560
notably missing back then Apple

378
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,260
so yeah but we upgraded USA to USB

379
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,199
and because everything needs a logo

380
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,779
we got a logo it's the the quite famous

381
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,600
Trident logo

382
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,720
it's on many of the USB plugs that you

383
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,480
stick in and it should show which site

384
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,500
goes up

385
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,079
though there's actual knowledge based

386
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,139
documentation that

387
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:50,579
documents the quantum state of a USB a

388
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,060
plug that you have to like flip it twice

389
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,320
to make it work

390
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,199
and usually this logo should be on the

391
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,399
upside

392
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,519
but it's a shoot and if you've read RFC

393
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,920
2119 you know should this open to

394
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,980
interpretation so

395
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,620
the idea was Universal serial bus work

396
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,199
began 1994 since intel was on the board

397
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,120
you probably would have liked to write

398
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,660
it that way

399
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,260
haven't they changed their own company

400
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,320
logo to get rid of this lower EU just a

401
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,760
little bit before and in

402
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,760
99 at all they didn't write it that way

403
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,300
and in 1995 a year after that they came

404
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,000
up with pre-release specifications 4.7

405
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,399
or 0.8

406
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,820
um and also the USB implementers Forum

407
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,440
was founded

408
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,759
by these aforementioned companies and

409
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:50,519
they also brought out a USB spec 0.9

410
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,339
0.99

411
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,440
yeah this is going where VLC version

412
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,800
numbers were for a long time at ignines

413
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,620
one 1.0 release candidate and hey

414
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,839
because everything needs a logo let's

415
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,540
give the USB implement this form a logo

416
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,520
yeah that's that's something it reminds

417
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,720
me of something else

418
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,020
like vodka Connecting People yeah

419
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,540
probably something products tomorrow

420
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,520
um so 1996 brought us USB 1.0

421
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,839
have you ever seen USB 1.0 mentioned as

422
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,760
compatibility somewhere

423
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,799
you have okay that's one person out of

424
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,380
the whole order too

425
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,320
everybody else here three okay

426
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,220
a handful

427
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,340
no most of it mentions USB 1.1

428
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,740
and it brought two connectors type A

429
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,260
that's a flat one you know from your

430
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,880
computers or

431
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,260
um

432
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,900
i o port on your on your motherboard and

433
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,700
the type B connector which is the more

434
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,679
square one from a printer probably

435
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,620
you've seen quite large ones I oddly

436
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,480
don't have that cable here

437
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,919
um and the plastic parts were supposed

438
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,179
to be white

439
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,580
of course supposed to be yeah yeah it's

440
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,020
actually special fun

441
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,720
okay two years later 1998 brought us USB

442
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,940
1.1 and that's one that's often

443
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,380
referenced

444
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,900
what are the

445
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,120
reasons for that well the first two

446
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,799
years nobody cared for the new kid on

447
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,660
the Block and certainly not for the one

448
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,360
on the i o Shield of your PC there

449
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,559
weren't any peripherals available

450
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,679
because everyone was using the Legacy

451
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:28,559
connectors they were already in use why

452
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,419
get something new and everything else is

453
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,160
there and works

454
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,140
so

455
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,200
there was no incentive to create any new

456
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,299
devices because consumers would not buy

457
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,520
them so it's a classical chicken and egg

458
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,720
problem

459
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,460
of course from nature studies we know

460
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,100
that the concept of an egg is very much

461
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,380
older than the concept of a chicken

462
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,000
so it certainly is an egg problem

463
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,480
um

464
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,179
so what could you do to make better

465
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,760
market adoption of USB well you need an

466
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,940
egg specifically this egg it was the

467
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,299
Apple iMac

468
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:07,919
and Microsoft coined the term of a

469
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,840
legacy free PC

470
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,940
we'll come back to that

471
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,039
but it meant a computer that only had

472
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,039
USB ports and none of the old connectors

473
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,260
anymore and this was the first one of

474
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,820
them

475
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,280
because Mac users back then were used to

476
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,559
having scuzzy for peripherals ADB for

477
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,600
keyboards and mice local talk for

478
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,179
networking and the iMac did not have any

479
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:31,320
of those

480
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,760
so

481
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,500
like you could not you could literally

482
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,539
not use a single one of your peripherals

483
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,640
that you already had like nothing

484
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,140
it did not come with a floppy drive

485
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,760
inside

486
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,580
let's

487
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,900
when people had to buy external USB

488
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,240
floppy drives and to match the color of

489
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,919
your iMac you could of course change the

490
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,440
faceplates I mean it's interior design

491
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,220
why would you not

492
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,720
and suddenly manufacturers had an

493
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,100
incentive because there was one computer

494
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,660
on the market that could not connect to

495
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,039
anything else

496
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,620
at least not without an adapter

497
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,260
so yeah is that only USB two ports of

498
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,360
them one was used for the keyboard and

499
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,039
you connected the mouse to the keyboard

500
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,240
already

501
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,340
either side was possible so yeah you

502
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,280
ended up with two more ports so Legacy

503
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,900
free was executed painfully hard

504
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,660
so yeah USB 1.1 as I've already

505
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,340
mentioned everything needs a logo so why

506
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,679
not use another logo for a USB 1.1 I

507
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,880
mean it's consumers will love logos and

508
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,380
it helps them understand different

509
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,760
things

510
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,640
so if we do an overview chart we have

511
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,460
USB 1.0 nobody cares about that it

512
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,160
specifies two plugs low speed devices

513
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,860
with 1.5 megabits of bandwidth like a

514
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,200
keyboard mouse like small peripherals

515
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,559
and a faster 12 megabit full speed

516
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,600
standard for faster devices like

517
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,539
scanners printers and the like

518
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,120
power supply was possible 100 milliamps

519
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,160
for a small device like a mouse 500

520
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,520
millimamps at maximum and each Port must

521
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,380
be able to provide those 500 milliamps

522
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,419
or you will get that message with this

523
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:10,679
device is drawing too much power please

524
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,179
disconnect it

525
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,980
or if the computer was too slow showing

526
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,600
that message it would automatically shut

527
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,840
down

528
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,340
what did people hook up to USB back then

529
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,600
well pretty much everything they could

530
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,220
get a hold of like a USB thumb drive

531
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,000
with USB 1.1 meaning around 700

532
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,640
kilobytes a second of real data transfer

533
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,780
rate

534
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,380
I mean USB sticks were 8 megabytes not

535
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,020
gigabytes megabytes back then so it

536
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,580
still took a long time but people were

537
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,080
used to having

538
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,940
scuzzy drives they were quite fast in

539
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,820
comparison so that's not nice

540
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,059
so a few years later

541
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,179
we said well let's do USB 2.0

542
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,820
that was the year 2000.

543
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,419
480 megabits per second of speed

544
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,820
that's a theoretical 50-something

545
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,860
megabytes a second a more practical 22.

546
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,940
that's that's what is left and

547
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,340
we we need a new name for that because

548
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,320
okay if we have flow speed that's not

549
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,419
good for advertising high speed uh it's

550
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:16,919
already taken that's called Full Speed

551
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,720
and since everybody everything needs a

552
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,059
logo you get a new addition to a logo

553
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,520
that you already know

554
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,900
and people need to be able to

555
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,520
distinguish ports because this is faster

556
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,980
you need to advertise it

557
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,340
and then people started using tablets

558
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,520
and you could connect your tablet to

559
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,220
your PC to charge it well that's nice

560
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,440
the computer is a host a tablet is the

561
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,200
client but what if I want to connect the

562
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,539
USB stick to the tablet now the tablet

563
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,480
would need to be the host

564
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,799
so we're closer getting to BDSM and Road

565
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,080
swapping here because that's what USB on

566
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,460
the go brought us

567
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,380
you could roll swap like a host could be

568
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,799
a client and otherwise depending on what

569
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,780
they agreed upon

570
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,919
so

571
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,720
and it also introduced new connectors

572
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,059
because well you have this A and B

573
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,919
connectors and

574
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:14,640
yeah but you cannot use a b connector on

575
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,380
a host and a connector on a client

576
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,900
because that violate the standard well

577
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,080
let's make a new sandwich and introduce

578
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,260
a mini a b and a micro a b connector

579
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,659
that can go both ways have you ever seen

580
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:31,559
a micro a cable not micro b on like on

581
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:36,440
your smartphone micro a or mini a

582
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,940
I salute your king

583
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,659
I support it it's really weird so our

584
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:45,539
overview chart grows

585
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:46,919
um

586
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,340
so with with USB 2 we have new logos of

587
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,940
course power supplies unchanged to the

588
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,400
very right hand side you see the colors

589
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,799
um white for the old ports black for the

590
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,620
2.0 ports so somebody thought of hey

591
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,600
help helps the users

592
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,260
and they introduced New Ports and USB

593
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,380
2.0 got a revision

594
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,059
1.01 that nobody talks about but it

595
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:15,240
actually introduces the mini a b mini a

596
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,280
and mini B connectors as well as the

597
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,520
micro A and B connectors

598
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,260
and

599
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,600
they're also allowed on USB 1.1 devices

600
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,840
but you cannot retroactively fit them

601
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,659
into the standard so what do you do

602
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,419
you're doing engineering change notice

603
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,480
in ecn and so well for these old devices

604
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,580
you can just use them as well so that

605
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,340
surely helps consumers

606
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,880
but otherwise

607
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,280
yeah 2.5 watts of power supply it's

608
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,780
still not a lot people wanted to charge

609
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,280
their phones their tablets on the

610
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,020
computer they wanted to charge them

611
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,640
faster

612
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,400
they also wanted to have more bandwidth

613
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,559
for more demanding tasks and larger

614
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,539
amounts of data

615
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:05,460
introducing USB 3.0 in 2008

616
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,159
5 gigabits a second but that's quite an

617
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,220
improvement huh

618
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,380
we need a new name

619
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,179
hi

620
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:19,140
um yeah we already use that full as well

621
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,080
um well how about super speed that

622
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,640
sounds good well let's call it super

623
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,159
speed give it a new logo because well

624
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,220
people love logos and also give it a new

625
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,360
connector

626
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,000
let's call it type c because a and b and

627
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,659
a b and on the go

628
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:38,640
sounds a little like Microsoft version

629
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,440
numbers of the operating system let's

630
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,880
call it type c

631
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,500
and type c specifies the physical

632
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,880
dimensions of the connector and nothing

633
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,740
else

634
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,960
but

635
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,760
new connections and new protocols

636
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,039
require new pins so those have five more

637
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,860
pins than the original four used in the

638
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,159
USB one and two connectors so if we

639
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:02,100
further expand our overview chart

640
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,159
you get at the very bottom USB 3.0

641
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,140
super speed with 5 gigabits a second

642
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,900
I'm pretty sure the types of connectors

643
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,539
do not work out as a regular expression

644
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:18,299
because there's a Greek mu in there and

645
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,400
you'll need to use utf-8 it will not

646
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,380
work but you get the idea there's a lot

647
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,720
more connectors and the new logo and

648
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,779
they slightly raise the power that you

649
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,720
could provide to a device so yeah your

650
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,240
tablet would charge in an hour less than

651
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,159
before so it looks nice

652
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,559
and also there's a recommendation for

653
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,620
USB 3 ports to be blue

654
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,320
has a certain color code make them blue

655
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,460
not related to the 90s song where

656
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,440
someone is blue and feeling double DW

657
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,840
but

658
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,260
yeah that's that's something

659
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,360
don't trust the colors

660
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,700
certainly don't trust USB port colors

661
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,919
for many reasons

662
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,179
but

663
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,419
what do we do when USB 3.0 super speed

664
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,880
is not fast enough we double the speed

665
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,200
that's something that computer

666
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,200
technology does it doubles every now and

667
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,700
then

668
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,580
Mr Moore piece rest in peace but it's

669
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,799
not every 18 months

670
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:23,820
it varies by by a large margin but USB

671
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,100
3.1 now you can have 10 gigabits a

672
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,120
second

673
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,820
and we call it super speed Plus

674
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,620
because we can

675
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,720
it's certainly I mean a plus is

676
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,539
certainly more than 5K it's it's twice

677
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:37,679
as fast so

678
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,020
yeah we might add a little 10 gigabits a

679
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,580
second because consumers certainly know

680
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,860
what gigabits per second means

681
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,440
we have a usual relationship like how

682
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,880
much is a bathtub

683
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,520
how many gigabits

684
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,200
yeah that's easy

685
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,279
so

686
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,220
it will help consumers distinguish ports

687
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,860
and cables and connectors

688
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,200
I've now got rid of all the

689
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,299
USB one and two stuff because that would

690
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:06,480
be even more annoying our overview chart

691
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,539
now looks like this USB 3.0 super speed

692
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:12,419
3.1 super speed plus with 5 and 10

693
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,760
gigabits and pretty much nothing else

694
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,100
has changed oh yeah tiny variation of

695
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,459
the logo

696
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,260
and while we're at it

697
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,179
um consumers might be confused by the

698
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,820
naming let's just rename a few things

699
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,559
but that

700
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,700
clear

701
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,200
so USB 3.0 super speed became USB 3.1

702
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,720
Generation 1 super speed I mean

703
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,100
we have the cable you know the one for a

704
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,419
USB 3.1 January yeah sure it's on stock

705
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:46,020
um

706
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,559
and

707
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,740
I'm entirely sure but

708
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,840
and since it's always a great idea to

709
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,580
introduce a new standard and immediately

710
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,400
rename it they did just that because USB

711
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,279
3.1 super speed plus became USB 3.1

712
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,860
generation 2 though it was its own first

713
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,240
generation

714
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,299
super speed Plus

715
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:15,059
sounded like a good idea at the time

716
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:18,600
so how did USB progress well 3.2 came

717
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,380
out and you guessed it A variation of

718
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,520
the logo

719
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,419
that was around 2017. it again doubled

720
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:30,240
in speed from 10 to 20 gigabits a second

721
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,299
so now it's really nice bandwidth

722
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,100
keep that super speed plus because

723
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,220
people like that it's it sounds fast

724
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,039
plus is more by now plus is pretty much

725
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,140
every Subscription Service on the

726
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,940
internet so you know

727
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,779
and 3.2 also said well these old

728
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,360
connectors let's deprecate a few of them

729
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,799
because

730
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,419
you know the original problem was having

731
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,340
too many connectors in too many variants

732
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,620
let's get rid of it

733
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,679
but let's deprecate a few of those so it

734
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,039
deprecates the just earlier 3.0 and 3.1

735
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,899
introduced super speed A and B

736
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,419
connectors with five more pins

737
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,940
the only recommended connector now is

738
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,100
USBC

739
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,399
but on motherboards USB a though being

740
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,860
deprecated is still allowed and still in

741
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,700
use

742
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,919
but we have an idea

743
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:26,220
let's introduce a new color for those

744
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,779
I mean the the other slow super speed

745
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:31,740
connectors and super speed plus

746
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,840
connectors are blue let's make the new

747
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,080
one teal

748
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,520
it's an elegant color

749
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,299
that's that's obvious

750
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,299
and

751
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,419
yeah we could use the teal color

752
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:55,440
for that one before as well because I

753
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,100
mean it's super speed plus isn't it

754
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,860
let's do an engineered change notice and

755
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,140
leak that color back to your existing

756
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,240
ports

757
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,940
I mean it worked well the last time so

758
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,659
let's rename things once again

759
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:16,440
yeah so now USB 3.0 the original one is

760
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,860
called USB 3.2 super speed generation

761
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,539
one

762
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:22,799
okay

763
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,899
3.1 became 3.2 super speed plus

764
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:30,240
generation 2. still being its own first

765
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,860
generation but now in the second

766
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,179
revision

767
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:37,320
and 3.2 got renamed itself to USB 3.2

768
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,520
super speed plus generation 2 by 2.

769
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,200
okay now consumers need to do math

770
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,200
before buying a cable okay you're still

771
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,100
with me

772
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,620
why two by two because they're now using

773
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,799
two pairs of data wires to like do

774
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,260
two serial Connections in parallel so

775
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,200
now the universal serial bus is also

776
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,500
quite Universal parallel serial bus at

777
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,980
the same time

778
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,580
to make this start not overly longer

779
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,059
than I already will need time for

780
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:15,419
there is a USB 4 specification and

781
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:17,039
that's exactly how it's written without

782
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,740
a space between USB and the number

783
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,159
because spaces are weird and they cause

784
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:24,960
all sorts of problems in file system

785
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,360
names and path specifications so let's

786
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,580
get rid of the space

787
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,980
and

788
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,220
yeah that's a problem for future me and

789
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,640
probably a future talk we need to limit

790
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,220
this somehow and you will see why if

791
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,320
you're not already sure yes this needs

792
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,020
limits also

793
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,179
you've seen slight variations of this

794
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:52,039
how much power can a USB port provide

795
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,539
since many manufacturers came up with

796
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,580
hey but our tablets need more power and

797
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,620
stuff and many manufacturers came up

798
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,740
with proprietary Solutions and the USB

799
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,779
implements forms can we standardize this

800
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:06,480
in some way so they came up with a USB

801
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,640
charging specification

802
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,399
which still limits most of it to 7.5

803
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,140
Watts

804
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,059
so meaning one and a half amps at five

805
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,320
volts still

806
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,179
except when it's not

807
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,880
then you can do 15 watts but only for

808
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,519
USBC connector on a

809
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,000
it's it's easy to grasp to get it and

810
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,340
also that power delivery power problem

811
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,860
was solved by Implement using a USB

812
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,019
power delivery as a new specification on

813
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:35,760
top of all the other specifications that

814
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,620
make up USB which is multiple thousands

815
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,620
pages of freely available documentation

816
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,600
and that is great

817
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,899
so um if you want to draw more power I'm

818
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,179
drawing the line here for power delivery

819
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:52,019
because that in itself is a rabbit hole

820
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:55,200
and enough for another talk so I'll not

821
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,380
go into that it exists it is really a

822
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,960
good idea it goes up to 100 watt with

823
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,299
standard power delivery extended power

824
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:06,779
delivery range is up to 240 Watts

825
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:10,040
over a USB cord

826
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,239
so cables will cause fires in the future

827
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:18,300
unless your cable gets a say in how much

828
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,179
power is drawn over it

829
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,820
future me problem

830
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,859
we've seen all the color changes have

831
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:28,679
you thought about accessibility

832
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,619
I mean accessibility with with USB ports

833
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:34,679
accessibility benefits everyone even if

834
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,000
you're not realizing that you're

835
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,639
benefiting from it

836
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,320
if you see a ramp that's not only for

837
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,500
for people in a wheelchair

838
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,699
side note you can sing that at karaoke

839
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:49,320
so a ramp is not only for people in a

840
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,199
wheelchair accessibility is also nice if

841
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,000
you have

842
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,560
a carry-on

843
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,440
or some larger piece of thing that rolls

844
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,460
behind you that you need to drag

845
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,480
somewhere

846
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,940
you're not disabled but it's really

847
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,440
handy to have a ramp and not carried

848
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,060
around across the stairs

849
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,920
and that applies to many different

850
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,460
aspects of accessibility and color is

851
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,859
one piece of accessibility that you

852
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:15,060
should think about

853
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,579
because around 13 of the worldwide

854
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,079
population have a problem with

855
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,320
recognizing red and green and

856
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,140
distinguishing between those two

857
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,480
thirty percent that's that's a few in

858
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,240
here that probably have some sort of

859
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,619
hard time

860
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:34,980
distinguishing blue I mean blue but blue

861
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,859
does not carry red or green but teal

862
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:39,660
that has some green in there and if you

863
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,740
cannot

864
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,320
it becomes more or less two shades of

865
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,520
blue

866
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,560
so yeah accessibility think about it

867
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,880
that's that's something interesting

868
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,040
because I certainly want to use that USB

869
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,520
3.2 super speed plus generation 2x2 port

870
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,140
and not the other one

871
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,320
I mean obviously so

872
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,440
yeah so would you like the blue one or

873
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,599
the teal one and have you even noticed

874
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,160
that the color changed

875
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,820
yeah so yeah accessibility it works and

876
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,680
it's it's a thing to think about because

877
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,599
people benefit from it

878
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,160
there's a famous song She Comes In

879
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,560
Colors everywhere

880
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,320
so the port color might not be what you

881
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,020
expect that port to be

882
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,300
and if it fulfills that promise it did

883
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,980
not make to you

884
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,359
quick guessing game

885
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:31,220
what type of USB port is that color

886
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,560
one something yeah that's right that's

887
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,520
easy

888
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,420
one okay what color is I mean what color

889
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,280
it is yeah it's a pretty absence of

890
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,940
color but what standard is that

891
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,880
two ish okay yeah yeah there's 2.0 and

892
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,300
2.0 version revision 1.01 yeah it

893
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,880
applies to both that's correct so yeah

894
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,700
USB 2 port

895
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,299
that's it

896
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,440
3.2 Generations

897
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,420
together you are absolutely right so

898
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,920
those having problems with the colors

899
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,380
and the projector being absolutely able

900
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,420
to display all 16 of the whole color

901
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,820
spectrum yeah

902
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,480
this is USB 3.0 super speed also known

903
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,940
as 3.1 super speed Generation 1 and also

904
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,280
known as 3.2 super speed generation one

905
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,940
but you before the release date

906
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,619
that's it but how do you fit that on a

907
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,780
slide

908
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,540
then we have this one

909
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,580
oh

910
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,760
[Music]

911
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
um

912
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,599
something with power

913
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:53,220
something with red that's a good warning

914
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,260
color

915
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,300
no it's actually USB 3.2 super speed

916
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,420
plus generation 2.

917
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,940
unless unless it is not and we'll see

918
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,119
why

919
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,859
that is that is that that famous steel

920
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:10,500
okay

921
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,619
who remembers the full moniker

922
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:16,700
that that only

923
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,400
generation two

924
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,320
before the renaming that is absolutely

925
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,200
correct the currently correct name is

926
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,400
this one

927
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,060
foreign

928
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,540
but are you sure

929
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,339
okay so you're suggesting this is a

930
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:53,520
proprietary charging stand standard

931
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,500
by Qualcomm

932
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,940
it's mean

933
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,940
that this port is either providing High

934
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,820
current not specifying by which

935
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,839
proprietary implementation

936
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,599
or it's sleep in charge meaning your

937
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,240
computer can be sleeping not being

938
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,420
powered up or shut down the some woozies

939
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,660
stayed in between

940
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,700
mandatory

941
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,740
it's absolutely not mandatory it's also

942
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,180
not mandatory to use the color for

943
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,419
anything

944
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,400
so depending if you have connected your

945
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,040
power brick to your laptop this yellow

946
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,460
Port May provide Power or not

947
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,060
it may provide more power or not or it

948
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,359
may not provide any power at all

949
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:44,820
also depending on the charge level of

950
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,099
your battery disregarding that it's

951
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:49,619
connected to a brick or not

952
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:53,099
so just try to find out or get one of

953
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,619
these this is a USB voltage meter you

954
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:56,880
can plug that in and it will tell you

955
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,520
what the port is claiming to deliver and

956
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,440
you can even daisy chain another device

957
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,540
and see how much current it actually

958
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,300
draws these are available for cheap on

959
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,920
uh

960
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,300
well-known Chinese retailers

961
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,280
and they work with pretty well it's

962
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,760
complain

963
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:24,420
this is what the projector calls green

964
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,579
I hope you agree

965
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:28,500
and I'm really sorry this means either

966
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,599
your laptop was manufactured by Razer

967
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,300
who use green as an accent color for

968
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,400
their branding or it's Qualcomm quick

969
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,640
charge

970
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,339
because nobody

971
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:43,500
requires any color to be used there's

972
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,579
orange ones by xiaomi

973
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:49,560
you're so close you're so close but

974
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,900
first there's purple

975
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,460
foreign

976
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,420
so this is Huawei another proprietary

977
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,460
charging standard and this one's not

978
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,380
only for USB a ports but now you get

979
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,260
your colored USBC type ports as well

980
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,180
that's Innovative huh

981
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,880
where's the color yeah it's purple

982
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,640
in type c well there's the very tiny

983
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,280
separator in the middle

984
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,720
that helps yeah also microscope or some

985
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,839
kind of manuf magnifying glass

986
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:27,560
you can take a picture and zoom in yeah

987
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,780
it's user friendly I mean colors come on

988
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,780
what does that mean oh we we had red

989
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,000
didn't we

990
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,380
huh

991
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,040
that

992
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,640
you're right

993
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,040
interpreted this color as red please

994
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,920
it can also mean High current or

995
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,859
sleep and charge

996
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:54,599
yellow or red

997
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,740
hmm

998
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,359
and of course you have this Orange

999
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,520
yeah

1000
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,280
if you have a problem distinguishing the

1001
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,440
yellows the Reds and the oranges that

1002
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,200
does not imply you have a problem with

1003
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,060
color vision

1004
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,680
it might be the projector

1005
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:21,359
often to you you might want to get

1006
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,720
checked

1007
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:26,820
they are the same absolutely I mean it's

1008
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,480
totally the same

1009
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,579
video direction will will approve they

1010
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:34,140
are the same color

1011
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,980
sure see

1012
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,500
projector is always right yeah this has

1013
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,599
absolutely nothing to do with power it's

1014
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:45,960
a high retention connector meaning if

1015
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,980
you have

1016
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,140
some device that has an orange port and

1017
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,760
you plug something in it goes harder in

1018
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,440
and if You Yank the cord you get the

1019
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,160
device flying

1020
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,000
yeah and some Chargers also have an

1021
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,680
orange and a green port

1022
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,020
not having any of the properties just

1023
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,460
described it's just because they're

1024
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,540
colorful and because I mean there's a

1025
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,339
spectrum of people there's a spectrum of

1026
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,480
colors

1027
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,480
can somebody please tell me what exactly

1028
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,420
that cable does support what can you do

1029
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,680
with it yes the answer is correct the

1030
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,220
answer is yes

1031
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,220
I did not say it was a USB cable

1032
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,700
it it is a cable but we can agree upon

1033
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,819
it is colorful and bright like the

1034
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:37,859
rainbow that's also nice

1035
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:41,760
it has four ends which certainly

1036
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,000
violates the USB certification

1037
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and any of the ones I've even USB on the

1038
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,040
go

1039
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,500
but there are three years on AliExpress

1040
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,260
and they probably also violate the laws

1041
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,319
of thermodynamics I'm pretty sure

1042
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,660
there's another cable I know this is

1043
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,800
unfair

1044
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,020
because we're talking about external

1045
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,940
connectors this one is solely used for

1046
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,460
internal connectors and they come in

1047
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,319
colors as well

1048
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,780
so that song She Comes In Colors

1049
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,940
everywhere the next line in the lyrics

1050
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,460
is she's like a rainbow

1051
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,640
and yeah USB ports they come like a

1052
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,819
rainbow they're very diverse

1053
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:26,520
and do not rely on the colors when it

1054
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,460
comes to USB ports

1055
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,000
when people refer with colors trust them

1056
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,280
they know best which colored flag they

1057
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,980
are and respect to those colors

1058
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,859
so now we have 14 different mechanical

1059
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:43,079
types of USB connectors that's about

1060
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,480
half that we have before so that solves

1061
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,780
the problem

1062
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,819
how do these devices talk to each other

1063
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:53,119
I'll be heavily over time

1064
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,400
so topology

1065
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,560
it's a so-called tiered star topology

1066
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,780
tiered star well up Stars okay meaning

1067
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,819
there's a host controller and there's a

1068
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:06,960
device

1069
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,119
and a computer kind of multiple host

1070
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,980
controllers but multiple devices

1071
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,500
connected to them and if you run out of

1072
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,599
ports you get a port replicator or

1073
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,880
multiplier it's called a hub a USB hub

1074
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,760
so you can get three or four or seven

1075
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,819
more ports of course you can put it up

1076
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:25,859
onto a hub onto an app

1077
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:28,319
and you can Cascade these until you end

1078
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,980
up with 127 devices on a single host

1079
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,599
controller port

1080
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,640
have you ever tried this

1081
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,520
because I would see like to see pictures

1082
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,260
I know a single company who actually did

1083
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,040
that but

1084
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,000
yeah there are the limitations applied

1085
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,660
but yes those 127 come from a seven bit

1086
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,119
index for that thing

1087
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,380
and

1088
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,240
so that the computer can learn about

1089
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,819
which devices on USB are connected

1090
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:01,619
they're using something called

1091
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:03,420
enumeration

1092
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,720
that is uh when a computer learns about

1093
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,180
a connected device remember USB is

1094
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,280
supposed to be hot pluggable meaning you

1095
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:11,940
can

1096
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,300
connect the disconnect devices and hubs

1097
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,060
at any time

1098
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,400
sometimes it's always all interesting to

1099
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,540
disconnect and connect and disconnect

1100
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,880
and connect very quickly because that

1101
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,780
will

1102
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,579
certainly help a computer to not get

1103
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,200
confused

1104
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,980
and

1105
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,560
I've totally lost my

1106
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,500
yeah and since we have different speeds

1107
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,500
with the version numbers a USB hub could

1108
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,920
be a USB 3 capable Hub but having a slow

1109
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,380
device somewhere connected so hubs can

1110
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,140
also translate between speeds

1111
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,319
and deliver your keyboard input from a

1112
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:58,140
slow keyboard faster to the computer it

1113
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,220
doesn't make a difference for the

1114
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,180
keyboard but

1115
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,280
it makes a difference for the bus and

1116
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,380
how it's used

1117
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,240
so how does this look like we have a

1118
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,579
host controller we have a device

1119
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:12,119
and we have multiple connections these

1120
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:13,680
are called pipes

1121
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,000
and these

1122
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,220
pipes go from the host controller to an

1123
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,140
end point on the device the device can

1124
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,480
have multiple endpoints

1125
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,980
up to 32 16 for input 16 for output most

1126
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,099
devices do have more than one actually

1127
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:31,680
all devices have more than one endpoint

1128
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,099
but most of them just have a view

1129
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:38,099
so so physical devices multiple logical

1130
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:39,960
devices

1131
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,839
so far so good yeah these pipes come in

1132
00:47:42,839 --> 00:47:46,079
two flavors message and stream

1133
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,380
a message pipe is bi-directional it is

1134
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,020
used for control and status

1135
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,300
so that's an organizational thing

1136
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,280
and it usually uses very short and

1137
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,140
simple commands

1138
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:02,099
for this communication so like the host

1139
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:04,200
controller says Hey device got something

1140
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,440
for me and the device nope

1141
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,160
okay that's simple messaging or a

1142
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,319
keyboard could

1143
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:14,819
say

1144
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:17,099
well the keyboard does not say anything

1145
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:18,540
because the host controller initiates

1146
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,220
communication and says wait hey keyboard

1147
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,380
got something for me and the keyboard

1148
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,780
yes somebody pressed caps lock computer

1149
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,760
okay

1150
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,359
hey keyboard please turn on that

1151
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:32,640
LED on the keyboard for caps lock and

1152
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,380
the keyboard okay

1153
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,300
so bi-directional communication your

1154
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,800
keyboard is an output device because it

1155
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,180
has some lights that

1156
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,220
glow probably

1157
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:44,339
and streams they are for larger data

1158
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,200
transfers and they are unidirectional

1159
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,098
they only go one way

1160
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,400
so we've learned about transfers and

1161
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,200
pipes

1162
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,140
transfers always happen upon request of

1163
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,720
the host it's like the pirate codecs

1164
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,839
only speak when spoken to USB device on

1165
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,000
its own will not start talking protocol

1166
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,560
in any way

1167
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,780
and these transfers come in three

1168
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,819
flavors

1169
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:14,940
it's quite a tasty specification their

1170
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,220
interrupt transfers there's bulk

1171
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,980
transfers and isochronous transfers well

1172
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:23,160
interrupts that's quite easy

1173
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,440
human input devices because they wait

1174
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,540
until somebody presses a button

1175
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,119
something happens an event happens and

1176
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:31,500
the device

1177
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,960
notes something happened and the next

1178
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,300
time the host asks me I should tell it

1179
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:40,140
to interrupt there's something happening

1180
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,940
so because you don't want your keyboard

1181
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,920
or your mouse to lag because you'll get

1182
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,680
fracked badly during a game

1183
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,760
and latency on a USB 2.0 have compatible

1184
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,520
keyboard is about one millisecond so

1185
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,740
that's that's quite okay

1186
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,920
bulk transfers oh yeah and interrupt

1187
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,619
transfers they have a guarantee for a

1188
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:03,000
quick response meaning they have a

1189
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,460
guaranteed latency of response on the

1190
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,099
bus so they don't have to wait very long

1191
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:10,380
so it's guaranteed that they will get

1192
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,619
their slot for a reply a bulk transfer

1193
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:15,960
on the other hand they will get all the

1194
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,880
remaining bandwidth on the whole bus

1195
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,740
unless there's two of them then you have

1196
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,819
to share

1197
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:22,200
equally

1198
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,240
it's like a good relationship

1199
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,280
they don't get any guarantees on

1200
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,160
bandwidth whatever is left and

1201
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,460
we can share among all the devices they

1202
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,680
don't get any guarantees on latency so

1203
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,960
one might be quick if there's not a lot

1204
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,240
happening one might be slower

1205
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,640
but they do get guaranteed delivery

1206
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,640
meaning hey there's a data packet and

1207
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,000
everything is acknowledged and if you

1208
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,099
get a non-acknowledge so no that didn't

1209
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:51,960
work out then please resend it and it

1210
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,420
gets resent until that works so for

1211
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,160
storage that is quite convenient that

1212
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,020
you'd know it actually ends up on the

1213
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,839
device makes storage more reliable

1214
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:03,359
unless there's body controllers but they

1215
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,619
never happen

1216
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:07,920
and then there's ISO Cronus

1217
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,700
transfers ISO meaning the same and

1218
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,859
Cronus over a certain period of time so

1219
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:16,140
the same amount of data over the same

1220
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,780
amount of time a repeatable they get a

1221
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,180
guaranteed data rate

1222
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,920
so that's a fixed bandwidth they can use

1223
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,380
they don't get a guaranteed delivery so

1224
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,380
some packets might get dropped and lost

1225
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:35,579
but that's quite usable for audio video

1226
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:38,040
Because by the time you know oh I've

1227
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,260
missed some samples for that audio it's

1228
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,819
already too late to retransmit them it

1229
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:43,559
does not make sense to like half a

1230
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:46,800
second later replay the audio from I go

1231
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,680
but no you just skip it and go on with

1232
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,839
it with that with the transfer same for

1233
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,460
video

1234
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,760
um like cameras speakers microphones

1235
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,640
they do this and it works fine

1236
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,619
so now that we have a ton of different

1237
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,319
devices that we can hook up to USB don't

1238
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,599
they only need drivers

1239
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:08,819
I mean yes

1240
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:11,220
they do

1241
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,140
but somebody thought of that and said

1242
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,599
well classes

1243
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,760
I mean classes don't work for society

1244
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,859
they certainly do not work for sub

1245
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:22,079
networks I mean like networking yeah

1246
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,880
that's a thing of the past

1247
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,980
but

1248
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,559
device classes are a thing with USB

1249
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,900
so to make implementations easier

1250
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,660
especially on the driver's side USB

1251
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,480
specifies over 20 different device

1252
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,920
classes

1253
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,599
and

1254
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,180
that device classes communicated by the

1255
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,740
device that it's compatible with this

1256
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,319
specification of the class

1257
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:47,880
and

1258
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,460
each of the multiple end points of a

1259
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,200
physical device can

1260
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,540
adhere to a certain class

1261
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,099
so you can have multiple of those

1262
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:57,619
communicated

1263
00:52:57,619 --> 00:53:00,900
and the the operating system will have a

1264
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,780
class driver for that specific one so

1265
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,720
you can today you can just use any USB

1266
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,579
thumb drive as a storage and plug it

1267
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:10,440
into almost any operating system that's

1268
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,720
been around for a few years and it will

1269
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,079
just work no matter which manufacturer

1270
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,900
vendor doesn't matter USB stick will say

1271
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,579
hey I'm a mass storage device I adhere

1272
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:22,980
to this class please talk to me and this

1273
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,900
will work so that is that is convenient

1274
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,540
because it makes development of devices

1275
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,760
cheaper mixed devices cheaper mix

1276
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,040
maintenance easier less bucks because

1277
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,160
operating systems with fundamental flaws

1278
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,339
hopefully get fixed but some specific

1279
00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:40,680
vendor that has a problem with one

1280
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,480
specific it might never patch it so

1281
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,980
that's a good thing

1282
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,520
and one of the most important classes

1283
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,319
I will not list all of them because

1284
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:52,079
there's a lot it's audio

1285
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,260
of course speakers microphones sound

1286
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,000
card you know the crappy USB ones you

1287
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,780
can plug in with a pink and bright green

1288
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,040
audio jacks on them so more colors

1289
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,599
or midi controllers you can you can hook

1290
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:11,579
up a piano an electric piano via USB

1291
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:13,680
has an audio device of course human

1292
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,380
interface devices we know an interface

1293
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,380
can be between a human a person and a

1294
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,720
computer so that's usually anything

1295
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,000
that's an input device

1296
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,420
keyboard mice tablets trackballs all

1297
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,760
these kinds of things joysticks

1298
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,920
something like that there's also

1299
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,079
physical interface devices so these are

1300
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,520
actuators

1301
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,559
meaning they can physically move

1302
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:39,000
something

1303
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,859
so if you have a game controller that

1304
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:42,480
has Rumble

1305
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,440
yeah if you get hit or drive besides the

1306
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,420
road it will start rumbling force

1307
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,940
feedback so that's a motor that's doing

1308
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,700
the vibration so that's an actuator

1309
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,500
and actually there can also be a human

1310
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,480
interface device

1311
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,240
yes there are USB sex toys

1312
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,220
and they adhere to the physical

1313
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,099
interface device class usually so your

1314
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:07,559
toys are compatible with whatever your

1315
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:10,140
game supports and you can just plug them

1316
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,220
in

1317
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,559
wherever they fit and you what you're

1318
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:15,839
comfortable with

1319
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,119
there's also USB Mass Storage the

1320
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:20,940
already mentioned USB thumb drives hard

1321
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,660
drives opticals ssds stuff

1322
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,720
um

1323
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,000
these classes can also get extensions

1324
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,940
for example mass storage was just used

1325
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,339
for plugging some storage device and use

1326
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:37,980
it but you cannot boot from it and since

1327
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,319
2007 this class got extended so for the

1328
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,540
last 15 years you were able to boot a

1329
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,480
computer from a USB device you may or

1330
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,460
may not have installed some operating

1331
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:50,339
system of your choice by that way it's

1332
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:52,980
quite convenient and it's possible that

1333
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,140
you find some old machine that does have

1334
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,599
USB ports but they will not boot and

1335
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,240
that's really annoying

1336
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,640
but yeah these things get extended and

1337
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,000
improved over time there's also webcam

1338
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
classes for audio and video

1339
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,480
brought a very nice webcam here

1340
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,800
it's

1341
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,800
um

1342
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:24,540
yeah thanks

1343
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,559
um

1344
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:29,819
this one is not a USB camera compliant

1345
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:32,339
it's very proprietary it's compatible

1346
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:34,859
with Windows 98 and Millennium Edition

1347
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:37,859
and a few others and this is just just

1348
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:39,720
the power bank it's very stupid thing it

1349
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,059
does not record any video so don't fear

1350
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:43,680
it cannot send this anywhere I mean you

1351
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,660
cannot make it work on anything

1352
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,960
and I'll hand it to the audience so you

1353
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,000
can just pass it around and see why this

1354
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,119
is the most annoying webcam probably on

1355
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,300
the planet

1356
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,440
so

1357
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,740
um yeah and webcams they use isochronous

1358
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,020
USB transfers because they drop a frame

1359
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,480
well nobody cares

1360
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,980
uh

1361
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,319
there are other classes for example for

1362
00:57:13,319 --> 00:57:15,300
hubs for personal Healthcare devices

1363
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,400
that is not sex toys that is pulse

1364
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,160
monitors for Bluetooth for serial ports

1365
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,819
for biometric sensors like fingerprints

1366
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:24,839
um and

1367
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:27,900
any class compliant device that

1368
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,760
communicates with a class compliant

1369
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,740
operating system on that fast they can

1370
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,380
just be used and work so

1371
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,420
that is very nice

1372
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,880
a device can also communicate that it

1373
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,400
absolutely requires a vendor-specific

1374
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,200
driver

1375
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,420
and says well I use this class and this

1376
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,160
endpoint uses this class and this

1377
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,960
endpoint yeah I know you gotta get a

1378
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,359
driver so you might have a camera that

1379
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,180
does work to get video and audio of it

1380
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:57,180
but it might also have a gimbal that

1381
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,640
meets a specific driver or it might work

1382
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:03,540
as an actuator so depends you'll see so

1383
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,960
how do devices introduce each other I

1384
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,540
mean you can plug things in but devices

1385
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,760
we've learned they don't start talking

1386
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,680
by themselves the host controller

1387
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,680
initiates communication

1388
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,660
well how we have a bootstrapping problem

1389
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,400
how do they start talking because the

1390
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,720
controller does not know about the

1391
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,940
device that's been just plugged in

1392
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,680
and the device won't say anything before

1393
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,020
it's been talked to by the host so okay

1394
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,599
there's something called signaling

1395
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:35,400
and it varies by version of USB in quite

1396
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,839
a while but for a very basic example USB

1397
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:42,180
one and two they had four pins one is

1398
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,799
five volts

1399
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:46,200
you have ground and you have data plus

1400
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,780
and data minus pins

1401
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:50,460
just these four

1402
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,960
and

1403
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,940
when you connect the device to a USB

1404
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,200
port

1405
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,900
it announces its Presence by changing

1406
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,900
the the level of the data pin

1407
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,240
depending on low speed device it will

1408
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,880
pull up D minus to a certain level a

1409
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,680
full speed device will pull up the Plus

1410
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,200
on a certain level

1411
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,839
so that's that's simple signaling that

1412
00:59:12,839 --> 00:59:15,540
the host can detect and notice so

1413
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,500
foreign

1414
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,720
something happens and there's a few

1415
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,740
things

1416
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:22,440
working with the signaling mechanism it

1417
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,119
does not specifically check which

1418
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:26,520
voltage level is there because as

1419
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,440
frequency increases of that signaling

1420
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,540
it's harder and harder to make out the

1421
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:33,540
difference on maybe a very small range

1422
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,599
so what's actually getting detected is

1423
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:38,339
the change in voltage so you have a

1424
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:41,040
rising Edge and that edge is easier to

1425
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,619
detect especially at high speeds in the

1426
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:46,619
falling Edge like the level dropped not

1427
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:49,319
by how much but it dropped and you note

1428
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,240
that it drops so this is the actual

1429
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,299
single the change makes the information

1430
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,720
and there's a few

1431
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,579
statuses that can be conveyed like

1432
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:01,140
detached

1433
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,540
so okay D plus and D minus are pulled

1434
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,160
down by a resistor on the motherboard on

1435
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,260
the host controller and it basically

1436
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:08,819
means nobody there

1437
01:00:08,819 --> 01:00:10,859
very easy

1438
01:00:10,859 --> 01:00:12,780
you have a signaling that's called

1439
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,359
connect somebody plugged in some device

1440
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,880
on a port and

1441
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,299
that's basically the device saying hi

1442
01:00:21,299 --> 01:00:23,280
I'm here I'm you

1443
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,559
want to talk to me and it immediately

1444
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:29,460
goes idle so idle is the next state

1445
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,680
waiting just looking

1446
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,180
waiting for something to happen someone

1447
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,980
to talk to me

1448
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,839
and then we already heard about

1449
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:39,660
enumeration so that the host can learn

1450
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,880
about the device because by now I just

1451
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,740
know somebody plugged in something on

1452
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,940
that port

1453
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:46,319
and

1454
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,780
there's a reset signal

1455
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,839
since we have a one-to-one connection

1456
01:00:50,839 --> 01:00:53,940
host says Hey reset

1457
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:56,460
so let's start enumeration so basically

1458
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,760
I want to get to know you who are you

1459
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,040
so when

1460
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,839
the device can answer with class

1461
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,119
specifications and the name and what it

1462
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:06,960
does

1463
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,760
and it's actually nice that the first

1464
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,520
thing a USB device will

1465
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,280
convey to the host controller is what

1466
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,680
type it is not you know you in a machine

1467
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,839
readable way but in the human readable

1468
01:01:18,839 --> 01:01:22,380
string so hi I'm a Frog webcam

1469
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,960
because

1470
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,880
and that is actually really important in

1471
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,420
smart and you'll see in a moment

1472
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,540
um

1473
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,220
you can suspend the device the host can

1474
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:38,640
tell a device you go to sleep now and

1475
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,078
the device will comply or not

1476
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,599
you can resume meaning wake up hose

1477
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,359
controller tells the device hey wake up

1478
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:51,420
but the device can also wish to wake up

1479
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:54,119
but it cannot do it on its own because

1480
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:56,400
it has to be told by the control so

1481
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,880
it can signal I would like to wake up

1482
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,099
would you like to tell me to wake up so

1483
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:04,260
that I can be protocol compliant and

1484
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,900
wake up

1485
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:09,660
host control yeah you may wake up

1486
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:12,000
so yeah

1487
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,700
and there's also the keep alive signal

1488
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:15,780
like

1489
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,240
um not really happening a lot but nope

1490
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,700
just stay awake now

1491
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,400
and there's also for higher level

1492
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,559
protocols needed there's a sync message

1493
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:29,280
a sync signal right it's like here comes

1494
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,960
a new message

1495
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,220
and I'm done with that message so you

1496
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,839
can't distinguish where it starts where

1497
01:02:36,839 --> 01:02:40,319
it ends and that is also very convenient

1498
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:44,220
so I promise you to yeah why is it

1499
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,260
important that a device tells you what

1500
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,500
it's called in a human readable string

1501
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,599
because enumeration is the next thing

1502
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,280
that usually happens after connecting

1503
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,440
but what is if something goes wrong

1504
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,020
device says like that broadcast I need a

1505
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,480
vendor specific driver and your Linux

1506
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,700
computers as well you're not in my class

1507
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,400
of devices so

1508
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,160
I can't do that there's no driver for

1509
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,540
this thing

1510
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:12,059
it can show you an error message and say

1511
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:14,640
sorry I cannot use this device but this

1512
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,260
is what it's called

1513
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:19,020
and if this is the 22nd different thing

1514
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,540
you have connected you know which one it

1515
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:22,260
is

1516
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:25,140
hopefully I mean who connects 20 frog

1517
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,599
camps but it helps to have the human

1518
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,339
readable string so that the person who

1519
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:31,020
connected the device knows that this one

1520
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:33,240
is not working and not something is not

1521
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,200
working

1522
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:37,140
so that's that's a very convenient thing

1523
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:38,819
so now that we have signaling

1524
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:39,960
established

1525
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,359
and can bootstrap a connection there's a

1526
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:44,520
protocol on top of that yeah so like

1527
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,680
actual language now

1528
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,940
and um

1529
01:03:50,819 --> 01:03:52,500
there's

1530
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,380
these these frames and you can make

1531
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,660
packets out of those frames

1532
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,400
and these these packets can have

1533
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,460
different types for communication so for

1534
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,140
a normal communication between a host

1535
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,119
and device you have for example for a

1536
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:07,799
handshake these four they are type

1537
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:11,460
handshake in the protocol so it's an

1538
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:13,680
acknowledge yeah I got that

1539
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,500
it's a Mac nope

1540
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,680
Does this does not work please repeat

1541
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,780
there's it yet

1542
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:24,780
in a U.S standard so I'm not ready to

1543
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:26,940
send the data yet and there's a stall so

1544
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,040
like something with that transfer is not

1545
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,960
working out um

1546
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,839
something's wrong here

1547
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,280
then there's

1548
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,720
um a packet called a token packet

1549
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,880
and it shows you in which direction the

1550
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,260
communication goes because the host

1551
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,420
initiates so everything is from the

1552
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,579
point of view of the host controller

1553
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:51,480
so an out transfer of data is from the

1554
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,760
host to the device so in transfers from

1555
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,640
a reply from the device to The Host

1556
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,500
there's a starter frame marker for

1557
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,540
synchronization because we have a timing

1558
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:02,160
and things need to know when it happens

1559
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,020
because we have one millisecond timing

1560
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:06,839
with USB 2.0 and there's a setup it's

1561
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:09,540
basically an out connection but it's

1562
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:11,880
only used for enumeration

1563
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,859
and that's also quite interesting

1564
01:05:13,859 --> 01:05:17,099
because you need to address the device

1565
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:19,740
there's also data 0 and data one they're

1566
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:22,559
basically the same they're just used

1567
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:25,079
one data packet is a zero a data zero

1568
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:26,940
type the Nexus or data one type and the

1569
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:29,160
next data zero and the data one

1570
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,260
and you should notice if something goes

1571
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,780
missing in between I mean at least for

1572
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,700
most devices I couldn't count from zero

1573
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,680
to one

1574
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:38,640
yeah

1575
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,960
so

1576
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,220
makes sense

1577
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,440
and

1578
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,180
from all that

1579
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,220
protocol and signaling

1580
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:49,559
we can do a transaction

1581
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:52,140
so connect to the device enumeration

1582
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:55,140
starts and the host says well hey device

1583
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:58,380
with that ID and that endpoint

1584
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:00,059
I have a control message for you it's

1585
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:01,980
called setup

1586
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,960
then the host sends the setup message

1587
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:08,040
like I've assigned you this ID and

1588
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,799
device acknowledges I've got it

1589
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:12,900
but how do you address the device during

1590
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,240
enumeration like how do you address an

1591
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,880
endpoint that you have not learned

1592
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,200
exists

1593
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,359
well there's a special endpoint it's id0

1594
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,460
because everything should be zero based

1595
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,859
unless you're a lure

1596
01:06:25,859 --> 01:06:26,940
um

1597
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:29,520
so during setup it's always addressed to

1598
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,319
end point zero and that one is only used

1599
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:33,839
for setting up the device and it tells

1600
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:35,400
you well I've got these many endpoints

1601
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,380
and they're that type and goes back and

1602
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,420
forth for quite a while and this is also

1603
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,220
the reason why plugging in the USB

1604
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:43,380
device does not make it available

1605
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:45,780
there's a lot of cheddar going on back

1606
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,880
and forth and this takes time

1607
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,460
and the more endpoints the device has

1608
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,819
the longer that will take because most

1609
01:06:53,819 --> 01:06:57,359
there's quite a lot of of

1610
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:59,520
things happening

1611
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,660
so yeah

1612
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,900
then you might get a data reply from

1613
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,640
um no uh

1614
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,000
send some data to a device post says Hey

1615
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,339
device with that ID and endpoint I have

1616
01:07:14,339 --> 01:07:16,799
something for you start listening now

1617
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,680
and then it's sensor data and the device

1618
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,680
thanks acknowledge got it wonderful and

1619
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:26,240
your caps lock LED lights up

1620
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,640
finally yeah

1621
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:32,880
after a minute try the password

1622
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,559
so the other way around an in

1623
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,240
transaction from a device to the host

1624
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,160
basically looks the same just the other

1625
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,799
way around hey device

1626
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,660
prepare to send data

1627
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,420
and hopefully the device is ready to

1628
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:47,280
send the data sense it and the host

1629
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,799
Technologies huh got it

1630
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:51,420
so

1631
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:56,460
USB is it a universal solution Broad

1632
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,680
is it really

1633
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,539
the original problems was many different

1634
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:03,660
devices connectors plugs that were not

1635
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:05,760
fitting each other

1636
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,599
variants of connectors USB has only 14

1637
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,000
for external devices

1638
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,400
that most of them are deprecated by now

1639
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,100
with current versions

1640
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,439
and

1641
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:21,779
that promise of a legacy-free computer

1642
01:08:21,779 --> 01:08:23,520
hmm

1643
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,738
because sometimes we still need those

1644
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:27,140
old

1645
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:30,540
connections for whatever reason

1646
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,179
device classes they make things easier

1647
01:08:33,179 --> 01:08:34,979
they make things cheaper more reliable

1648
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:36,479
they're a good thing

1649
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,479
this helps a lot

1650
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:42,719
versioning and naming and logos within

1651
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,279
USB

1652
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:46,439
I think

1653
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:48,238
complete cluster is an

1654
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:50,040
understatement

1655
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:53,479
I mean for consumers

1656
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,120
who can remember all those colors

1657
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,560
um

1658
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,439
there's more additions coming to USB or

1659
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,420
already there but they're not in this

1660
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:05,040
within the scope of what I can show you

1661
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,660
here

1662
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,460
um there's Thunderbolt which is

1663
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:11,279
basically PCI Express over that USBC

1664
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,979
connector but not really over a USB

1665
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:15,238
protocol

1666
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:18,299
there's alternative modes for like

1667
01:09:18,299 --> 01:09:20,160
DisplayPort you can send video signals

1668
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:23,100
and USB and other things so you have

1669
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,259
just one cable connected to your monitor

1670
01:09:25,259 --> 01:09:27,600
from the laptop and the monitor charges

1671
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,420
your laptop of a power delivery and you

1672
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:33,899
get video out and speakers on the

1673
01:09:33,899 --> 01:09:37,439
Monitor and USB so that's convenient you

1674
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:38,698
just plug in one cable and everything

1675
01:09:38,698 --> 01:09:40,679
should work

1676
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:42,719
mostly does

1677
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,219
that's nice

1678
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:46,738
and sure this makes implementation of

1679
01:09:46,738 --> 01:09:49,259
future devices more complex more

1680
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:51,479
standards to be compliant more problems

1681
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:52,979
that can come up

1682
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:56,100
and cables will become a very critical

1683
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,360
problem

1684
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,520
not only for users but also for

1685
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,960
standards compliance in that regard

1686
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,219
it also leaves a lot of room for future

1687
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:06,900
talks on this topic so if you want to

1688
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,060
join me or request something in the

1689
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:10,920
future for me

1690
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,340
Legacy free is a lie it's a complete lie

1691
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,679
I mean we need those Legacy ports you've

1692
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:20,580
seen it like video ports

1693
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:25,880
very obscure video cables RGB coax

1694
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,320
laptops without ethernet I mean who

1695
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,260
makes those okay I'm using one um but

1696
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:34,760
yeah you need those rg45 connectors yeah

1697
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,719
they're important

1698
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:38,880
of course you want a USB device that's

1699
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,760
compliant with your coffee mug this is a

1700
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,840
heat plate it's not very hot yeah it's

1701
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,739
probably good to

1702
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,360
yeah it's a very very weird you can you

1703
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,239
can charge your batteries from

1704
01:10:57,239 --> 01:10:59,159
from this toy for example that's my

1705
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:02,460
presenter remote yeah not to be inserted

1706
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,739
um and there's there's many other things

1707
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:06,000
that

1708
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,120
if you get too hot you can get a fan

1709
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,239
let's let's a USB device it only uses

1710
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:15,420
five volts not no data so you cannot

1711
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,940
even know how fast it spins but you need

1712
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,640
those those Legacy connectors and

1713
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,140
um

1714
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:24,780
I've brought one of those very Legacy

1715
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,560
devices it's uh

1716
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:31,460
it's have you an idea what this is

1717
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:35,100
either Enlighten or an endoscope

1718
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,500
both wrong

1719
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,640
both kind of right though

1720
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,480
I mean

1721
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,540
you could insert it

1722
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:47,760
but I wonder what you would do with it

1723
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,560
this is a barcode scanner

1724
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,300
when when was the what year about

1725
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:00,239
in the 80s yeah that's about right that

1726
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:03,540
devices from the late 80s it has a few

1727
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:05,400
connectors because you know the barcode

1728
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,199
scanner is a camera

1729
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,780
and a keyboard and it has connectors for

1730
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:13,260
Apple desktop plus ADB it has something

1731
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:15,480
called CPU I have no idea what that is

1732
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:19,260
it has a keyboard connector rj11 of

1733
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,659
unspecified pin out

1734
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:24,719
it has another CPU connector with RJ45 I

1735
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,179
have also no clue what this is about it

1736
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:30,120
has a DIN connector for keyboard and the

1737
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,400
PS2 connector for keyboard

1738
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,679
you can still buy this device

1739
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:38,159
for around 100 Euros or dollars

1740
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:41,059
something like that

1741
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,100
and since Legacy is a lion I'm a Mac

1742
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:47,040
User and we've learned that the iMac had

1743
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:51,480
no ADB ports there's adapters for USB

1744
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,760
to ADP so you can use an old Apple

1745
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,400
keyboard on your new shiny iMac of

1746
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,500
course my laptop does not have any USB a

1747
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:02,340
ports anymore so I can use a USBC to USB

1748
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:06,300
a adapter connect that to my USB

1749
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,960
to ADB adapter connected with an ADB

1750
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:10,980
cable

1751
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:13,199
to the barcode scanner you've all seen

1752
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,000
that famous photo on the internet where

1753
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,300
you plug in devices but

1754
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:20,400
this thing does not really work I mean

1755
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,100
physically you can but that device at

1756
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,480
the end doesn't really do anything

1757
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,040
anymore

1758
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:30,600
and yeah we can connect this one here

1759
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,440
and

1760
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,760
always a good idea to plug in a random

1761
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,380
USB device from the 80s into your

1762
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,719
presentation laptop

1763
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:42,840
please don't try this at home

1764
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,900
so I've

1765
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:48,659
this yes you can probably see a red dot

1766
01:13:48,659 --> 01:13:51,600
it's not a very high energy laser so I

1767
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,580
won't slice any one of you in half

1768
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:55,820
and

1769
01:13:55,820 --> 01:14:00,120
I deliberately bought brought a barcode

1770
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,460
okay you just have to trust me from

1771
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,760
behind that this is a barcode

1772
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:09,360
uh this can in theory read

1773
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:13,440
code 39 en13 and something something two

1774
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,600
out of five I can't remember the name

1775
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,540
properly and now I should manage to

1776
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:21,140
somehow

1777
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:25,260
switch this and scan a barcode with this

1778
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:29,699
and if I get that right it types in the

1779
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:31,520
barcode I scanned

1780
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,800
not on your screen okay so

1781
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,780
I have not sacrificed enough

1782
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:44,280
goats or whatever is the current uh

1783
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:52,920
yeah hello I can

1784
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,120
it's always nice to have multiple

1785
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:55,440
screens I had no idea where your mouse

1786
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,760
cursor is

1787
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,260
so

1788
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:02,340
okay we'll take the scanner and move it

1789
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:03,480
across

1790
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,120
and if you want to check that's really

1791
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,780
the barcode

1792
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,120
all right

1793
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,699
so if I find my mouse cursor again I can

1794
01:15:14,699 --> 01:15:18,060
switch back yeah so Legacy free is a lie

1795
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:21,540
we still need those old things

1796
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:23,540
um

1797
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:26,659
smart card readers

1798
01:15:26,659 --> 01:15:29,340
come up afterwards there's a few more

1799
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:32,159
weird things here that use USB

1800
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:34,320
Rush

1801
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,659
uh probably yes you can also hook them

1802
01:15:36,659 --> 01:15:37,920
up to

1803
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,500
um car stereos and if you have an MP3 on

1804
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,060
there you can actually play them usually

1805
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:43,980
I don't bring it I didn't bring it

1806
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:46,080
floppy but um the Once Upon a bite

1807
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,480
people with their accent exhibition I'm

1808
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,820
sure they can help us out so what does

1809
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:52,860
the future bring of course Thunderbolt

1810
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:55,980
over USBC we've already heard that PCI

1811
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:56,880
Express

1812
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:59,820
power delivery I've got the power and it

1813
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:02,400
will be really interesting

1814
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,340
um usb4 without a space

1815
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:08,760
certainly and

1816
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,219
there's already a specification for what

1817
01:16:11,219 --> 01:16:13,679
comes after usb4

1818
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:17,100
because USB 4 tries to fix some of the

1819
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,640
problems of USB

1820
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:24,659
3.2 super speed plus generation 2 by 2.

1821
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:26,040
yep

1822
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,960
and the other ones that came before it

1823
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,280
and were renamed

1824
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,640
so if you get a vote what would you call

1825
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,560
the next USB version

1826
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:42,420
five hyperspace I heard six okay

1827
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:45,620
any other suggestions

1828
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:48,440
just USB okay

1829
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:51,199
USB plus plus

1830
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:54,659
interesting no the actual I kid you not

1831
01:16:54,659 --> 01:16:56,400
the actual name of the next USB

1832
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,080
specification is

1833
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,880
USB fault version 2.0

1834
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,219
so

1835
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:17,040
I'm I'm left speechless who comes up

1836
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,640
with

1837
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,060
so I guess we're going to do a couple of

1838
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,460
questions but not too much and I will

1839
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,199
ask you to wait for me to bring you the

1840
01:17:40,199 --> 01:17:42,960
microphone before starting the question

1841
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,400
yeah

1842
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,560
just because there's a volunteer running

1843
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,780
around thank you to all the volunteers

1844
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:51,360
who keep this conference running this

1845
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,760
year the last years

1846
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,820
and future Balkans you absolutely rock

1847
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:58,739
this would absolutely not be possible

1848
01:17:58,739 --> 01:18:01,020
without you so thank you very much I

1849
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:01,980
hope you had

1850
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:05,520
at least some fun here and

1851
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,219
um also thank you to the balconorga team

1852
01:18:08,219 --> 01:18:10,920
for getting up a really awesome

1853
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,659
conference and keeping the community

1854
01:18:12,659 --> 01:18:14,100
spirit

1855
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:17,760
up and running and not having us overrun

1856
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,699
by vendors and marketing people and

1857
01:18:20,699 --> 01:18:23,520
sales people let's let's keep it to the

1858
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,080
interesting hacking stuff and the

1859
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,060
community

1860
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:28,620
questions

1861
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:32,400
yes thanks so you mentioned that the USB

1862
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,280
fan that you have is a USB device

1863
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,260
so what is the lower limit for USB

1864
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:39,840
device like like if I plug in two wires

1865
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,780
in there is that a USB device

1866
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:45,239
I'm not sure acoustically could make out

1867
01:18:45,239 --> 01:18:47,580
everything so if I plug in two wires

1868
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:50,100
into the USB port to pair wires is that

1869
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,140
also a USB device like where does USB

1870
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,659
device start

1871
01:18:54,659 --> 01:18:56,820
um from my understanding a USB device

1872
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,560
starts at the point where it does

1873
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,960
signaling this one does not lose any

1874
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,600
signaling it literally just connects the

1875
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,940
5 volt to ground and runs it over a

1876
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,140
motor

1877
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:11,520
so this is bang stupid that's not a USB

1878
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,900
device it just abuses the connector to

1879
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,520
get power

1880
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,320
but

1881
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,780
those connectors they're quite large you

1882
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:23,580
could fit something in here and make

1883
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:26,780
something interesting out of it

1884
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:38,580
welcome back excellent talk I still

1885
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:40,140
remember the previous one with the

1886
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:42,840
storage is is a lot of fun the same as

1887
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,360
with this one

1888
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:47,280
just one practical question I I suppose

1889
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,380
you have a lot of those cables I have

1890
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:51,600
two you know like and when you when you

1891
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,159
you know like

1892
01:19:53,159 --> 01:19:56,159
put your hand in a box right and box is

1893
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,500
full of USBC cables how how do you pick

1894
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,360
the right one with the correct power

1895
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,760
delivery specification the speed and

1896
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,500
everything is there any practical advice

1897
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,739
how to do it uh the the only correct is

1898
01:20:07,739 --> 01:20:10,380
correct answer to that is you don't you

1899
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:11,340
don't just

1900
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:15,300
grabbing to a snake pit and pick the

1901
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:17,460
right snake

1902
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:19,380
I mean

1903
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:21,620
what about that octopus

1904
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:26,400
usb-a USBC apple lightning micro USB

1905
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,920
yeah I have no idea

1906
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,600
I actually started labeling them so I

1907
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,219
know which one is yeah you know which

1908
01:20:32,219 --> 01:20:34,980
one sports what as as I said in the

1909
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:38,300
future Lookout with USBC cables there is

1910
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,760
next to no way for humans to distinguish

1911
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,800
what the actual cable is capable of

1912
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,179
exactly yeah

1913
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:47,159
um because with USBC cables you actually

1914
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:49,980
have a chip inside the connector and

1915
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:52,860
that one actually gets a say in the

1916
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:54,719
negotiation between the devices at the

1917
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:59,159
end so like a power brick like this one

1918
01:20:59,159 --> 01:21:01,260
it can say well I can deliver 100 watts

1919
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:04,739
and the laptop can say well I I can use

1920
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:07,400
60 watts and your cable in between the

1921
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,320
uh I'm a little shy today I'd like to

1922
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,260
use 30 or I might go up in flames

1923
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:16,380
and no you have no way of distinguishing

1924
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:19,260
these just by looking at them

1925
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:22,640
um as a Mac User I know Apple delivers

1926
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:25,739
USBC power delivery power bricks with

1927
01:21:25,739 --> 01:21:28,080
their current lineup of laptops they

1928
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,659
deliver a cable yeah yeah and that cable

1929
01:21:30,659 --> 01:21:32,940
is I'm saying only usable for power

1930
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:35,820
delivery charging it does not provide

1931
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:39,480
any user data it only transfers the data

1932
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,460
it wants to transfer to negotiate power

1933
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,800
delivery but you cannot plug in a hard

1934
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,540
drive with it it will not work yeah

1935
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,460
that's just because the cable says well

1936
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:49,280
I don't like you

1937
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,719
and there's actually an apple knowledge

1938
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:55,880
based article to distinguish the

1939
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:59,640
multitude of USBC to C cables

1940
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,699
and how to tell them apart and their

1941
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:04,920
actual suggestion is well there's on

1942
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,739
this mostly gray cable there's a tiny

1943
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:11,719
code written in mostly gray letters

1944
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:14,880
which after three weeks of use are no

1945
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,640
more existent and by referencing that

1946
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,679
code to their knowledge base it will

1947
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,179
tell you what this cable should be

1948
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:23,840
capable of

1949
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:26,699
label them and hope that the cable

1950
01:22:26,699 --> 01:22:29,239
actually does what the vendor or the

1951
01:22:29,239 --> 01:22:33,000
AliExpress item listing claims there's

1952
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,219
no way to rely on that thanks once again

1953
01:22:35,219 --> 01:22:37,560
and welcome excellent talk

1954
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:40,400
thank you very much

1955
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:47,760
you're only prolonging the karaoke party

1956
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,540
so keep asking

1957
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:54,179
very briefly you said that uh and I I

1958
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:59,100
know that also that USB 3C whatever is

1959
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,199
called is actually carrying a

1960
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:05,159
thunderbolt signal and we knew that

1961
01:23:05,159 --> 01:23:07,800
previously Thunderbolt signal were was

1962
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:12,300
carried over the the special cable on

1963
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,659
the Apple computers that were actually

1964
01:23:14,659 --> 01:23:20,400
mini display part uh type but the

1965
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,280
question is

1966
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:27,960
as far as I know uh USB both USB and and

1967
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:30,420
Thunderbolt are actually engineered by

1968
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:31,920
Intel right

1969
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,980
so my question is

1970
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:38,940
um uh as a thunderbolt uh is it just

1971
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:42,920
kind of a protocol inside the the

1972
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:46,920
USBC carrier and and that's how they

1973
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:49,380
operate or

1974
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:53,100
almost and and are there any other kinds

1975
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:58,199
of of a protocol also inside it okay so

1976
01:23:58,199 --> 01:23:59,400
the question is what about that

1977
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,620
Thunderbolt over USBC connectors and are

1978
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:02,760
there other things

1979
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,400
so the cables you were talking about

1980
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,960
um that's one of those

1981
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,659
that's a thunderbolt one and Thunderbolt

1982
01:24:09,659 --> 01:24:13,860
2 cable the connector it uses is the

1983
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:15,300
same connector the same physical

1984
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,679
connector as is used in Mini DisplayPort

1985
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:21,239
DisplayPort being a display standard for

1986
01:24:21,239 --> 01:24:24,140
video signals and mini display being

1987
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:26,460
connector specification for that

1988
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:30,600
signaling so this is just a cable you

1989
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,820
can come here and look at it

1990
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:34,159
um

1991
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:36,320
Thunderbolt itself

1992
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:40,199
basically being PCI Express signals like

1993
01:24:40,199 --> 01:24:43,860
with a Pizza Express card slot that same

1994
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:47,760
signal just for external versions

1995
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:48,719
um

1996
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,940
older Apple models did use this Mini

1997
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:53,219
DisplayPort connector for Thunderbolt

1998
01:24:53,219 --> 01:24:57,679
connections and DisplayPort connections

1999
01:24:57,719 --> 01:25:01,500
um you can get an adapter from USBC

2000
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:04,260
that one can carry Thunderbolt 3

2001
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:05,580
connections

2002
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,620
and with this adapter you get

2003
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:09,600
Thunderbolt 1 and 2 backwards

2004
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,760
compatibility which actually is only the

2005
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,739
physical connector used to it

2006
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:16,860
so yes you can do that that works not

2007
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:18,060
only with apple that's a little

2008
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:20,460
specification so you can use it with PCS

2009
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:22,140
as well if your operating system

2010
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:27,140
supports that and with USBC you get

2011
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:30,500
from three point something

2012
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,960
you get a way to run an alternative mode

2013
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:38,400
so you get a USB connection and the USB

2014
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,100
pairs the the both ends of the

2015
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:42,000
connection

2016
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,179
can ask do you support an alternative

2017
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:48,480
mode for using these wires and one of

2018
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,219
these alternative modes that they can

2019
01:25:50,219 --> 01:25:53,219
agree upon is Thunderbolt and one other

2020
01:25:53,219 --> 01:25:55,800
is DisplayPort

2021
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,420
and that's how you get a monitor with

2022
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:00,420
only a USBC cable that can do multiple

2023
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:02,820
connections including charging

2024
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:04,320
so this is the mechanism that's used

2025
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,940
there it's one of the class compliance

2026
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:08,699
uh yeah so so my question was actually

2027
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:12,360
so Thunderbolt protocol is not embedded

2028
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,940
inside the USB but it's completely

2029
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:18,360
different it's signaling it's

2030
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:21,060
it's switching over the pins for that

2031
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:24,780
other user and but the the initial as

2032
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:28,460
far as I'm up to speed with that already

2033
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:31,620
uh the initial connection is USB and

2034
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:32,580
it's

2035
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:34,020
basically

2036
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:36,120
talking to each other can we switch this

2037
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,739
port to this other one and then they

2038
01:26:37,739 --> 01:26:40,040
switch over and

2039
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:43,020
previously there was a FireWire

2040
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:47,280
interface which was intended actually to

2041
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:50,639
speed up the communication between video

2042
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:53,460
devices that needed more bandwidth which

2043
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:57,540
wasn't available at the time and today

2044
01:26:57,540 --> 01:27:01,320
we have kind of Forgotten firewall

2045
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:04,500
firewire which went to the firewire 900

2046
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:07,139
or I mean nine pins nine pins sorry a

2047
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:11,280
800 megabits but but uh nine pins we

2048
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:14,820
have a thunderbolt and that's the the

2049
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:20,100
the USB 3 or 4 or whatever generation or

2050
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:23,100
specification it is do we actually need

2051
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:26,699
still Thunderbolt or I mean firearm

2052
01:27:26,699 --> 01:27:29,000
obviously seems like like a dead thing

2053
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,920
but does uh Thunderbolt has some sort of

2054
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:37,460
advantages because as far as I know

2055
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:40,560
Intel and apple were jointly developing

2056
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,900
the the Thunderbolt for the sake of the

2057
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:48,659
high speed storage or or I I know if

2058
01:27:48,659 --> 01:27:51,360
it's it's monitor as well but it seems

2059
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,100
to me like it's kind of a competition

2060
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:56,480
between the Thunderbolt and and the USBC

2061
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:00,659
so is Thunderbolt going anywhere or is

2062
01:28:00,659 --> 01:28:03,780
it going to be deprecated and into the

2063
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:07,520
USB Thunderbolt is getting Incorporated

2064
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,980
to as an add-on to the USB specification

2065
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:13,860
as one of the multiple alternative modes

2066
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:15,900
we're already there you can already use

2067
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:18,179
this this is a thing not the thing of

2068
01:28:18,179 --> 01:28:20,159
the future this is already usable I'm

2069
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:22,620
I'm literally using it right now

2070
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:25,739
um and as for firewire yes that was a

2071
01:28:25,739 --> 01:28:27,960
great Port it was a great idea it

2072
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,420
technically worked really well the nine

2073
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:33,900
pin you can use that to a thunderbolt

2074
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:36,659
adapter and connect firewire with this

2075
01:28:36,659 --> 01:28:39,840
nice uh Abomination to your USBC port

2076
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,719
and that provides power as well yes back

2077
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:45,120
in the time when firewire was needed USB

2078
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,980
could not provide the bandwidths and the

2079
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:49,679
reliability and all that needed for

2080
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:53,880
video applications by now USB has by

2081
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:56,520
large caught up and superseded what

2082
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:59,400
firewire could do back then and

2083
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:03,360
Thunderbolt goes way beyond that so USBC

2084
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:08,600
as a connector USB 3 4 and 4 version 2.

2085
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:12,360
as standards and Thunderbolt will be the

2086
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,860
ones we see in the future and use

2087
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,480
certainly

2088
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,620
okay

2089
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:20,400
maybe I I can also add to this that pcie

2090
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,560
over USB or Thunderbolt however you want

2091
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,980
to call it is useful for external gpus

2092
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:27,239
so you can connect the GPU to your

2093
01:29:27,239 --> 01:29:29,699
laptop so that's one of the useful type

2094
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:33,120
usages where USB won't cut it yeah

2095
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,940
the adventure was actually that doesn't

2096
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:39,179
have that in the future as such or it's

2097
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:42,000
going to be consumed by the no no that

2098
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,739
that is certainly backed by multiple

2099
01:29:43,739 --> 01:29:47,699
vendors and standards bodies uh as the

2100
01:29:47,699 --> 01:29:49,860
thing to go in the future and it's

2101
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:52,400
already here

2102
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:56,520
guess that's it oh one more okay one

2103
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,560
last question

2104
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,659
do you think in your personal opinion

2105
01:30:00,659 --> 01:30:02,100
that uh

2106
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:04,920
sometime in the future divorcing from

2107
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,320
the term USB would be beneficial to

2108
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:11,219
remove all the confusion so far so just

2109
01:30:11,219 --> 01:30:14,300
call it something else

2110
01:30:14,699 --> 01:30:17,219
you mean like

2111
01:30:17,219 --> 01:30:20,040
renaming the USB implementers Forum to

2112
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,500
something else indeed yeah just just

2113
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,420
dropping the name and dropping the super

2114
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:26,760
speed and everything right developing 16

2115
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,460
standards I I don't see that coming at

2116
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,860
the moment but I also did not foresee

2117
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:35,340
the various renaming schemes for USB 3

2118
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:39,239
and forth so yeah it's I would not rule

2119
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:41,959
it out entirely

2120
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:45,120
all right thank you everybody and go

2121
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:48,080
ahead and enjoy the karaoke
