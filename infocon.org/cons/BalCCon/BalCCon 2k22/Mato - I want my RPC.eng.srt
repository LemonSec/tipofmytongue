00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,680
[Music]

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,520
thank you

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,060
[Music]

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,260
hello everyone our next talk is I want

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,060
my RPC by matoma

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,059
thank you

8
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,120
thank you folks

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,420
okay today I'm gonna talk about what

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,260
normal

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,860
uh-huh

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,420
I'm gonna talk about uh

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,100
RPC so frankly it's not about exactly

14
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,320
RPC it's about Microsoft RPC okay

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,860
so this kind of a story is about will be

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,920
told from Windows perspective and in in

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,000
Windows World okay

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,799
before we proceed let me introduce

19
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,820
myself I don't have this who am I slide

20
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,939
uh so uh because time is of the essence

21
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,840
we need to move quickly uh I work for

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,979
infigo as a instance responder stock

23
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,119
analyst I've been involved in a lot of

24
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,320
Investigations and I love purple teaming

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,900
also I possess some offensive skills

26
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,400
that's that's about me okay

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,200
oh

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,280
so like you mentioned I I will talk

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,020
about

30
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,960
RPC I will describe some

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,798
internals of windows

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,740
it's let's say this is some basic basic

33
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,560
stuff just to be sure that we are on the

34
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,380
on the same level

35
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,099
after that we should go to the uh

36
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,760
offensive scenario we will look at the

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,560
RPC from attackers angle and next we

38
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,300
will do the the opposite from the uh

39
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,360
from the from the offensive

40
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,200
uh scenario okay

41
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,379
so RPC actually stands for remote

42
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,040
procedure call okay so this guy told me

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,160
that I need to be normal but actually I

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,860
need to move in front of closer to the

45
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,180
to the microphone

46
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,280
uh so okay it's not a problem it's okay

47
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,840
so it stands for remote procedure call

48
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,700
it's a part of IPC so what is IPC let's

49
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,220
imagine that you have a

50
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,739
Chrome process you just want to download

51
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,019
some stuff and the Chrome needs to

52
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,400
Signal the default Windows shell it's

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,819
Explorer it helps to Signal it that you

54
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,760
are downloading some stuff from the from

55
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,500
the internet that's the that's the one

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,019
case another case would be let's say

57
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,019
that you just

58
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,280
type your password and login in into

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,159
your workstation so the net login

60
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,260
process actually will call the other

61
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,379
part of the

62
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:49,739
uh let's say story it's it it's about a

63
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,400
process on DC on the main controller and

64
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,760
then

65
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,340
basically it it will send some contents

66
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,319
to to the other side so uh IPC can be

67
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,159
both on locally just locally and it can

68
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,580
be across Network boundaries and we can

69
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,939
execute code and or something on the on

70
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,760
the other side let's say on some other

71
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,918
uh

72
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,940
uh we have uh one concept here it's very

73
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,300
important for uh for IPC in Windows and

74
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,080
it's a

75
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,820
name pipe so uh when Microsoft in I

76
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,940
think

77
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,560
890s Microsoft was trying to put RPC

78
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,120
into its stack

79
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,220
but they already had some some

80
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,979
flavor of IPC it's a

81
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:58,199
LPC but it's a local procedure call but

82
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,660
it has some major flow in design

83
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,020
so they decided to put some better

84
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,520
technology there and the easiest way for

85
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,460
them is to

86
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,300
this is only assumption let's say to

87
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,860
based

88
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,620
RPC on named pipes so name pipes

89
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,080
actually it's also part of IPC and

90
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,280
we have we have SMB we have a named pipe

91
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,639
and above that we have our RPC so our

92
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,120
RPC will use a named pipe for

93
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,020
transportation purposes okay so guys one

94
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,380
question for you uh do you know maybe

95
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,100
which of those fancy Microsoft Windows

96
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,479
protocols

97
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,759
uh

98
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,139
uh using named pipe for its

99
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,639
transportation

100
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,240
do you know maybe which which of these

101
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,340
it's it it's a very very popular

102
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,900
protocol

103
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,720
it's actually it's SMB so we have SMB on

104
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,060
top of that we have name pipe and on top

105
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,180
of that we have RPC so a lot of overhead

106
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,039
there and if you ever wonder why your

107
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,500
system administrator

108
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,740
administrator uh had a tough time with

109
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,139
troubleshooting Windows so this is this

110
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,940
is the reason it's a lot of overhead

111
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,520
there okay

112
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,160
uh well a lot of times a lot of time in

113
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,360
in spend on on on first slide okay

114
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,380
so like I said we have a client and

115
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,340
server this basically are two processes

116
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,220
and client wants to communicate with

117
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,740
server process

118
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,919
on the bottom of the page we can see a

119
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,259
there's a part of name pipe

120
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:05,160
and you also need to know that

121
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,880
if you can write some code about

122
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,220
RPC

123
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,400
you know that you could

124
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,560
transport RPC through directly to trees

125
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,699
to through TCP via TCP okay

126
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:23,120
so we need to have that

127
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,419
because of uh detection okay that

128
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:28,400
knowledge

129
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,220
so you can see there's a lot of uh

130
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,759
there's a various

131
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,560
methods and

132
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,440
parts to exploit this you can exploit

133
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,319
client-side server side also

134
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:48,419
attacker could proxy some communication

135
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,539
between two two of these processes and

136
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,819
the we have this third component

137
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:58,319
endpoint mapper basically it's a like I

138
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,639
would say this is just a basic example

139
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,060
it's like a let's say net table or

140
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,660
something like that it will map

141
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,180
where a client is was the port

142
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,280
serverless and again

143
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,780
Etc

144
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,940
uh so that's the that's the uh

145
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,620
this is

146
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,580
generally RPC uh has a lot of components

147
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,599
that can could be exploited

148
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,880
uh okay

149
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,779
um

150
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,799
here we have a

151
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,880
two stories one is all about how threat

152
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,200
actors abuse some components in Windows

153
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,339
and the other is how the fender

154
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:55,320
can use Telemetry of RPC to to to detect

155
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,120
this this type of attacks okay

156
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,380
so we will follow a steps of attacker

157
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,800
and this is just let's say ordinary

158
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,740
ordinary attack he will use ordinary

159
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,480
attack parts and and but

160
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,820
I

161
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,200
I want to send some message to to this

162
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,640
examples okay so we have a very skilled

163
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,640
actor

164
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,519
he already bypassed ABN EDR uh

165
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,700
already done with payload delivery and

166
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,940
the initial execution so

167
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,680
please don't drink vodka with that guy

168
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,899
okay

169
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:48,180
so he he's moving towards privilege

170
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,420
escalation phase

171
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,760
and he needs to

172
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,959
choose some attack Vector for for that

173
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,279
for that part of attack

174
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,120
okay like a lot of other attackers he

175
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,640
want to check

176
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,040
exit directory configuration operating

177
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,760
system some some to check some defaults

178
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:21,600
he's aware that Ado is fully patched up

179
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,300
to date

180
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,800
but he stumbles upon that SMB signing is

181
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,399
not enforced

182
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,040
and she know that

183
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,920
there's some default configuration that

184
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,640
user has rights to to join to join

185
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,100
computer objects to a domain

186
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,980
so

187
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,180
with that

188
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,579
in mind

189
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:54,140
he chose to go with with

190
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,600
research-based constraint delegation

191
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,660
attack it basically it's a Kerberos

192
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,120
kerberus attack so he wants to abuse

193
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,339
some

194
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:09,240
Kerberos attributes and

195
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,940
and want to escalate his privileges

196
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,000
there okay

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,060
so let me stop here for a moment you may

198
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,899
ask now Mata why are you talking about

199
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,399
Kerberos

200
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,019
but your main title is all about RPC

201
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,940
so that's the catch and that's the

202
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,140
message I want to send maybe our

203
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,579
attacker

204
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,740
he doesn't know anything

205
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,899
about RPC

206
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,140
so he just followed his playbooks and

207
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,420
that's all

208
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,140
so he he will run all of these tools to

209
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,399
complete

210
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,399
his actions and to to to reach his goals

211
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,980
but

212
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,779
generally

213
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,060
it's not necessary and important for

214
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,240
them to know that behind the scene RTC

215
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,040
is used

216
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,279
okay so if you look sorry sorry for that

217
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,940
quality but if you look at all those

218
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,560
arguments uh

219
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,860
all the strings past s arguments to

220
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,480
curable relate Tool uh you you should

221
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,700
see a com object

222
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,560
so

223
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,380
what's com

224
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,540
basically com is all she's a part of IPC

225
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,839
and this this is intentionally missed to

226
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,820
to to to say this uh at first so now we

227
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,560
have

228
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,620
come basically it's a part of RPC and

229
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,160
we'll use RPC to qualify uh

230
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,120
Transportation transportation

231
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,899
up to 45 transportation

232
00:12:53,899 --> 00:13:01,320
and purposes so we have now we have SMB

233
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,820
on top of that we have a name pipe on

234
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,480
top of that we have uh

235
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,360
the RPC and the top of that we have a

236
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,000
com object component object model so

237
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
it's all part of uh this all part of IPC

238
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,779
technology and stack in Windows so

239
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:29,040
Windows has a lot of overhead there uh

240
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,500
okay and

241
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,500
this first command is actually just a

242
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,800
part of enumeration tasks

243
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,040
and this tool checkpot

244
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,300
it look for uh

245
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,139
ports available com ports

246
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,620
the other part is the actually is the

247
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,899
main part of resource-based constrained

248
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,600
delegation

249
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,639
and that so it it's not important for us

250
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,620
I just want to emphasize that the

251
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,579
the uh this these tools behind the scene

252
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:11,519
use RPC and that's the that's the that's

253
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,000
the catch

254
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,540
so here we have our rubles you all know

255
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,040
about robots

256
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,959
uh cameras which tool for

257
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,660
passing the ticket and we are here here

258
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,459
are attacker using s4u and this nearly

259
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:36,480
identical like chaos TGs says Peru

260
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,839
function

261
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,320
and I try to figure

262
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,160
is there some RPC involved there but I

263
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,399
didn't find anything

264
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,279
so I put I put it here because we need

265
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,740
to follow just to follow the story

266
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:03,300
and the last part is our attacker wants

267
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,930
to patch uh

268
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,959
[Music]

269
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,019
service control manager

270
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:12,560
to actually to

271
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,440
to allow herself to pass the Kerberos

272
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,560
ticket for local authentication so the

273
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:28,320
when you heard a service in Windows and

274
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,079
schedule tasks uh

275
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,240
um

276
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,300
you could conclude that RPC is also

277
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,420
behind the scene so there's also RPC

278
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,779
doing your stuff uh doing his stuff

279
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:46,680
behind behind the scene okay so uh

280
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,320
attacker response CMD under and and the

281
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,959
system and

282
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:56,880
here one step closer to a secret plans

283
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,579
okay uh now we look at this attack from

284
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,720
the defender single and try to try to

285
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,440
detect this type of attacks

286
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,339
so our Defender likes to spend some time

287
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,940
on maitre and wants to

288
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,420
research some things about RPC and he

289
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:26,779
was astonished about how RPC technology

290
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:32,459
spans across this my graph

291
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,320
and

292
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,860
and also he wants to

293
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,000
to learn more about it so

294
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,680
sorry

295
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,759
oh

296
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,240
I lose some slides here

297
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,940
strange

298
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,120
Okay so

299
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,440
[Music]

300
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,519
when she know about a lot of AD

301
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,639
exploitation tools like DFS squares

302
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,040
rubles Kerber relay

303
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,780
Etc

304
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,400
so uh

305
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,619
he followed this trend and wants to see

306
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:17,699
are there any code of RPC in these tools

307
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,040
so

308
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,199
he realizes that a lot of tools actually

309
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,100
is dependent on the RPC stack

310
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,020
so he wants to he wants to

311
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,799
it's not about tools it's about Windows

312
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,840
it's about technology behind the scene

313
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,600
so he wants to detect on

314
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,200
to detect this technology

315
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,860
to detect RPC so he comes up with two

316
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,020
plausible Solutions

317
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,460
and he recalls that

318
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,120
RPC is based on name pipes so he wants

319
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,480
to utilize cismon

320
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,340
and the two two events dedicated for for

321
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,120
pipe events and there's the 70 and 80.

322
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,100
he needs just to uh to tailor some some

323
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,799
configure to alter some configuration of

324
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:25,140
uh of a template and now he can use it

325
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,440
to to detect

326
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,860
a malicious RPC activity

327
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,559
so here we have a

328
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,520
queries for a query for named pipes also

329
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,640
sorry for for quality but colleagues

330
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,679
said me that that it it will be a better

331
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,280
on YouTube so

332
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,640
here we're just looking for a

333
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,679
combination of a pipe name

334
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,580
and the image the process

335
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,940
and this actually one of my favorite

336
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,080
hunting query because with with

337
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,200
this kind of technique uh actually you

338
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,600
could detect a lot of other tools like

339
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,939
Cobalt strike and you know

340
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,360
uh so I'm not fun to put my production

341
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,160
rules here but uh

342
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,440
just try to try to detect some

343
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,919
combinations between

344
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,400
image process and some suspicious name

345
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,799
pipe or let's say

346
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:44,780
um

347
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,000
not very

348
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,280
frequently used name pipes and images in

349
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,820
your system so look for that that that's

350
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,400
the that's the one I used a lot for for

351
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,100
all other tools also for ad exploitation

352
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,520
generally

353
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,360
the other plausible solution here is uh

354
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,480
uh he wants to audit all uh RPC calls

355
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,740
and uh

356
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,260
[Music]

357
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,080
he wants to use RPC firewall for from

358
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,440
zero networks and it can be used to

359
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,980
audit all RPC calls

360
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,120
um

361
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,880
and like this one is to create it

362
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,299
creates its own uh

363
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:37,679
event Loop Channel and actually you

364
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,340
could detect a lot of a lot of things

365
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,320
about RPC about RPC attacks there

366
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,940
uh

367
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,740
so one remark here is a

368
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,480
there is no direct connection between

369
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,919
offensive tool set you'll see you saw a

370
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,860
few moments back

371
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,400
and this RPC fireable events but we have

372
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,260
this interface uid

373
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,380
which actually told us

374
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,240
that

375
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,539
there is some

376
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:24,320
com interface that's not

377
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,440
using a lot

378
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,020
and you should try with that also and

379
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:36,740
try to try to pinpoint on some

380
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:42,960
non-generic uh interface your ID here

381
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:46,740
if you remember the First Command of our

382
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,220
attacker this is a check Port

383
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,520
enumeration of com ports and the actual

384
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
this technique

385
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,659
could catch a attacker early in his uh

386
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:04,520
his face

387
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,520
so uh also there's a

388
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,380
I said that a lot of RPC calls are based

389
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,919
on name pipes so here we have a uh

390
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,280
actually a RPC called uh executed

391
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,640
directly through TCP so it's also a good

392
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,000
good way to to detect this kind of

393
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
attack

394
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,600
so what we learned

395
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:39,020
this is more for uh some other

396
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,919
conference but generally

397
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:46,080
you see that the windows

398
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,980
has a lot overhead there uh

399
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,940
we have a lot of encapsulation of its uh

400
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,299
main protocols

401
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,020
a lot of tools for ad exploitation

402
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,480
basically behind the scene use RPC it's

403
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,900
a huge attack surface

404
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,860
um

405
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,140
so uh

406
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,480
try to strive to detect

407
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,059
to to to make some more resilient

408
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:24,960
detections uh because if you just want

409
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,860
to

410
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:32,039
detect some strings or uh your uh your

411
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,679
tool sets are dependent on on that

412
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,260
strings

413
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,000
then it will have a problem because you

414
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,780
don't have uh you don't you can't

415
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,220
catch all of these tools

416
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,659
you know

417
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,700
and uh

418
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,520
I've been I don't know maybe I was there

419
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,340
on a science course

420
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,520
a few years ago and it's it's a forensic

421
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,440
course and my uh I asked my uh

422
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,980
instructor why we don't use us

423
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,500
assessment in our Labs so he said

424
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,679
he should then rename the course to be a

425
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,980
six month course just because

426
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,520
it would catch a lot a lot of attacks so

427
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,580
use system and that's all

428
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,860
folks

429
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,039
from me

430
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,400
okay questions

431
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:37,489
[Applause]

432
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,720
anyone

433
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,400
it's not a tough

434
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,059
domain

435
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,900
okay

436
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,799
sorry maybe we can grab a beer and

437
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,840
then you should ask me some something

438
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,480
about this

439
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,110
okay thank you guys that's all

440
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,220
[Applause]

441
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:16,119
[Music]

442
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:24,539
[Music]

443
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:27,260
thank you
