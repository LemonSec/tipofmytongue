00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,680
[Music]

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,520
thank you

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,140
[Music]

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,599
okay guys it's time to start our next

6
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,000
talk is called screaming into the void

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,980
all e-signatures in the world are broken

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,850
by curious into it

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,520
[Applause]

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,739
thank you

11
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,980
so I'll start with a little bit about

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,780
myself

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,920
um

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,920
I do a lot of different things I I don't

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,320
only hack I also run business and I do

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,640
some science and I actually have a

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,980
scientific position back back in Latvia

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,120
where I'm from

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,879
but

20
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,460
so last one and a half days I was trying

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,299
to set up the flipper development

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,280
toolkits to be able to compile from

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,979
Flipper modules so I do like to hack uh

24
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,619
this presentation here is a result of me

25
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,840
hacking in my kinda kind of free time

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,420
you can find the slides on curls.org you

27
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,920
also have recordings there you can find

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,040
the slides of other presentations that I

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,799
um that I do I think this is my fifth

30
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,500
presentation since uh beginning of of

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,080
the global pandemic

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,659
the first presentation that I didn't do

33
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,159
because of the pandemic was called

34
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,659
what's going to be called travel for

35
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,720
hackers like how to travel the world

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,000
um true story I had it had almost ready

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,840
and everything and now now we have that

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,600
um so I'm gonna

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
tell a little bit

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,880
about related and other interesting

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,200
research

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,299
um that's that's been going on

43
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,659
so in 2017 many of you may remember that

44
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:04,979
Google

45
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,079
published the vulnerability that they

46
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,720
called shattered

47
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,379
basically they finally proved that shot

48
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,420
one is broken and you can you can

49
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,099
actually do some nasty stuff with it if

50
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,360
you have a

51
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,599
many millions or or maybe hundreds of

52
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,760
thousands of of dollars

53
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,840
but those that actually looked at their

54
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,420
published researched notice that you can

55
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,520
reuse the research without spending any

56
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,860
any significant amount of computing

57
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,620
power and create

58
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,420
any random two documents with the same

59
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,239
Jackson so in 2017

60
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,340
I presented

61
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,080
a vulnerability to our local

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,480
International

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,340
body that is responsible for managing

64
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,319
e-signatures I I created two different

65
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,379
documents both uh both signed and then I

66
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,420
then I asked them to sign one document

67
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,280
and and was able to

68
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,500
um change the content without breaking

69
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,700
the signature but that's a different

70
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,099
story this this vulnerability here is a

71
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,080
completely different vulnerability that

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,819
I'm going to talk about today one more

73
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,019
project I'd like to mention and we're

74
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,700
gonna and and this is part of my my

75
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,220
academic work we're gonna see

76
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,659
presentations coming out probably

77
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,580
beginning of of next year it's a

78
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,300
wearable security so we are

79
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,140
researching the different different

80
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,700
emanations that come from different

81
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,280
variable devices

82
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,040
pacemakers headphones watches stuff like

83
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,440
that really quite a wide project lots of

84
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,400
stuff happening so let's get on with it

85
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,980
we're going to talk about

86
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,720
who

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,040
can

88
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,000
fix uh the problem and that's that's

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,860
kind of kind of the big part here it's

90
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,599
it's not easily fixable but before that

91
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,299
we're gonna talk about the digital

92
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,799
signatures

93
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,500
as I stand how they work not all of you

94
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,659
are probably aware

95
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:02,459
how people perceive content which is an

96
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,840
important part of this vulnerability

97
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,700
here

98
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,739
um the attacks so

99
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,439
I managed to recreate I'm using the term

100
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,980
recreate here uh three different attacks

101
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,959
this larger process which was oh as it

102
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,478
always is super fun and what's next and

103
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,238
how to how to actually try to fix this

104
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,540
so I use the term ReDiscover or recreate

105
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,440
here because the basic attack

106
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,139
was actually independently discovered I

107
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,960
think more than 10 years ago uh way

108
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,639
before re-signatures were like a

109
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,560
government thing

110
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,660
gpg we fed for some time we can sign

111
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,460
documents we can sign emails right but

112
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,300
the governments weren't really

113
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,360
interested they they it wasn't a a tool

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,620
that um

115
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,080
general public would use

116
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,400
now

117
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,479
since 2020

118
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,240
general public loves or well they have a

119
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,680
love-hate relationship is signing all

120
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,000
front documents but they do have the

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,120
signaling documents so it's a big deal

122
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,340
now one of the essential functions of

123
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,500
digital signatures is to guarantee the

124
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,240
Integrity of signed data that's

125
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,160
basically the whole thing if we have a

126
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,720
paper signature we have a document we

127
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,280
scribble something and then experts can

128
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,960
take a look at if the scribble is real

129
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,720
or not and if you have tried to paste

130
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,120
some paper over the world word in the

131
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,160
document right for digital signature

132
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,160
it's kinda kind of similar so the

133
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,740
question is if the actual document that

134
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,660
you have signed is the same document

135
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,460
that you are verifying and here's a nice

136
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,160
nice thematic from trevor.com on how

137
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,139
that works

138
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,240
if we were to use the cryptographic

139
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,639
functions to actually sign the document

140
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,940
we would double the document in size so

141
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,400
what we actually do is we sign the hash

142
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,500
of the document and this is how

143
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,720
shattered vulnerability worked we could

144
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
create two different documents with the

145
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,240
same hash

146
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,479
now here we are attacking

147
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,100
one step

148
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,419
earlier

149
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,820
we were attacking the actual the actual

150
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,220
data and we're attacking the human human

151
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,740
perception of that now let me quickly

152
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,300
finish about the signature process so we

153
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,400
take the data we hash it then we do some

154
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
cryptographic magic we basically encrypt

155
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,120
the hash

156
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,580
and that's our signature

157
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,319
um that's our digitally signed document

158
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,699
so we have the original document the

159
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,340
hash and the uh and the encrypted hash

160
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,380
for verification someone takes the

161
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,060
document it's not encrypted the document

162
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,100
is not takes the encrypted hash also

163
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,800
known as signature uh and tries to use

164
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,900
isometric cryptography using your public

165
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,400
key to see if

166
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,259
um what will it decrypt to and then

167
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,900
hashes the original data you can see it

168
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,180
on the right here right so we have

169
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,160
encrypted stuff uh they use your public

170
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,440
key and then they try to match if the

171
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,419
decrypted stuff matches the hash of the

172
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,160
data you gave it to them it's quite easy

173
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,139
like that now but we are attacking right

174
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,080
here before before there is no

175
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,600
cryptography attack here uh just just

176
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,600
some magic before hashing

177
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,819
now

178
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,880
um EU I believe well I am from EU myself

179
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,979
and I believe that

180
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,680
I can objectively say that EU is on the

181
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,440
Forefront of digital signature

182
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,539
standardization EU love standard and

183
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,660
so we have a PDF which is I don't

184
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,419
believe in EU invention I think it's it

185
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,580
has to do with Adobe so you can actually

186
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,039
have a PDF that's still a PDF and then

187
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,780
it's hashed and signed and it's still a

188
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,360
PDF in the end uh I hate it but it it's

189
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,319
it's legit it it can it's what it works

190
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,259
it's considered legal even though the

191
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,639
official advice from Latvian government

192
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,300
for Linux users is ah when you want to

193
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,699
verify your PDFs

194
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,720
then we have asitza format or however

195
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,580
you don't pronounce it this is official

196
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,000
EU format and it's a container it's a

197
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,479
compound file so similar to docx for

198
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,099
example right you can what that

199
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,280
basically means in in layman's terms is

200
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,979
in this in these examples you can rename

201
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,199
the file to dot zip and extract it and

202
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,819
take a look at what's inside what which

203
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,099
is which is what we can do at one point

204
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,360
then we have edoc which is a Latvian

205
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,120
standards it's a bit different on on how

206
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,160
the XML inside the container works but

207
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,660
basically the same thing so you have a

208
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,059
zip file with the document you're

209
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,760
signing and some some crypto or crypto

210
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,599
magic that we talked about earlier

211
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,299
all these three formats and any other

212
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,899
format that I I'm aware of so far

213
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,260
is a digital file obviously and they

214
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,360
sign the bits and that is the critical

215
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,440
part here

216
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,360
they don't sign

217
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,339
the document that humans perceive it

218
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,560
perceive it right

219
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,839
so humans perceive

220
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,480
a page it may be landscape like in this

221
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,820
case with some letters on it that that

222
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,320
that makes sense

223
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,700
right

224
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,440
if I were to

225
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,540
sign

226
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,399
this document digitally and by the way

227
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,760
assets and edoc both allow and actually

228
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,160
require the implementations to allow to

229
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,680
sign whatever you want I can sign dot

230
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,580
MP3 I can sign dot ISO I can sign my

231
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,500
Hardware image

232
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,480
and it's in the specification and as

233
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,320
we're going to see at the end of the

234
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,839
presentation is part of the problem here

235
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,060
um so

236
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,160
let's talk about Dynamic content now now

237
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,500
when I say Dynamic content what I mean

238
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,660
is uh bits

239
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,779
of the file do not change at all but the

240
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,180
representation does so what the human

241
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,279
sees will change here's the gif file uh

242
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,320
it's a it's a green square right uh

243
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,820
believe even though it's it's in the

244
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,019
presentation believe me it's a simple

245
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,459
gif file I can show it to you later and

246
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,140
suddenly it's yellow

247
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,220
visiting chains it just has two frames

248
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,440
so if I were to sign this gif file and

249
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,959
if I were to set the timer for the

250
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,660
second frame from 20 seconds to let's

251
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,120
say 20 000 seconds

252
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,459
and if I were to add text to frame 1 and

253
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,740
to frame two what will I sign

254
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,440
if I sign that gif file

255
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,899
both right but why will I know that I I

256
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:23,580
signed both that's that is a real

257
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,899
question here

258
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,120
um now sending gift files isn't isn't

259
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,120
cool like lawyers do not I mean I

260
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,040
haven't tried it to be fair that could

261
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,959
be a that could be a thing like

262
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:38,100
yeah but or SVG uh but but lawyers

263
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,860
prefer documents

264
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,120
um

265
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,060
so luckily for us we have object link

266
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,640
the object linking and embedding which

267
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,839
are which is a mechanism allows

268
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,519
documents to include links to other

269
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,440
documents or embed other documents

270
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,120
within the document

271
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,940
um my first personal

272
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,480
connection experience with with Olay was

273
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,360
when I was in school and we had to

274
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,760
um add a spreadsheet Within A Word

275
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,200
document so we had a Word document but

276
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,459
we had to have a spreadsheet that allows

277
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,839
you to calculate stuff and that's

278
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,140
basically excel in in word uh which is

279
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,019
one kind of all a document

280
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,360
now this mechanism makes it possible to

281
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,779
include content whose representation

282
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,880
depends on variety of criteria

283
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,800
now how many of you would know how to

284
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,200
make an Excel file that shows your

285
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,019
random number when you open it

286
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,940
okay about uh

287
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,519
15 of the audience yeah

288
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,899
so you see where I'm going with this

289
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,399
right

290
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,459
um

291
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:44,880
when we talk about uh dot six or or

292
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,240
actually even even ODT the open format

293
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,899
um

294
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,940
there are also such things as static

295
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,640
object prerenders which means that if

296
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,180
you have a drum viewer well old Legacy

297
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,800
viewer let's call it correctly Legacy

298
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,839
viewer and it doesn't know how to deal

299
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,480
with all the objects standard requires

300
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,079
you to include an image of how that all

301
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,360
objects should look approximately uh if

302
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,700
it's if it's fully rendered now

303
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,740
interestingly enough of course you can

304
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,019
change the pre-render after you create

305
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,839
the file so it looks differently

306
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,459
and

307
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,860
most importantly remote content

308
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,320
now emails with remote content have been

309
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,720
accepted as part of the culture for

310
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,579
London hacker culture but the corporate

311
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,740
culture for the past 20 years you have

312
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,500
the tracking pixels and all that so I'm

313
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,480
thinking I could convince someone to to

314
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,459
actually be able to open a document that

315
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,860
has remote content in it because there

316
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,560
is a once again a mechanism to to allow

317
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,600
you to do that

318
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,360
now this is just for classic document

319
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,360
formats remember that EU mandates you to

320
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,260
be able to sign your ISO file as well

321
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,540
or else file right what happens if it's

322
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,120
an L file uh okay uh let's look at

323
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,019
a small demo here now

324
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,120
so this is this is a gift as promised so

325
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,540
it's 16 613 byte it's it's real I'm

326
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,980
gonna just put it in the corner so you

327
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,380
can see that I'm not lying in case none

328
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,300
of you have seen gifs and and how they

329
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,240
work or gifs whatever float you're about

330
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,200
um

331
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,339
so

332
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,639
I have a couple educ files here or the

333
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,639
delays turbo on the mouse

334
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,100
I'm gonna open it with the official

335
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,380
reader that our government uses oh

336
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,380
I need internet for that to validate

337
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,180
because it also even though it can

338
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,820
happen offline it also checks the

339
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,579
verification of signatures I hope mine

340
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,560
isn't revoked yet

341
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,420
um so

342
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,920
oh the gift is yellow I'm going to

343
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,660
remove the clear up the screen state so

344
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,459
here it is um that's that's a document

345
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,200
here

346
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,240
um and fun thing about the official

347
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,860
Latvian reader is that if you open the

348
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,480
document

349
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,760
um and it it displays who signed it and

350
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,040
this blue thingy here that doesn't mean

351
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,480
that the signature has not been tampered

352
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,680
with you have to press the validate

353
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,420
button and then it changes into Greener

354
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,940
red a bunch of users fall for that all

355
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,100
the time um so this is green it's valid

356
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,620
uh what it says here in in

357
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,380
pretty clear Latvian is that uh Gary a

358
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,380
agrees to pay guy B uh zero thousand

359
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,420
zero thousands of Euros right so

360
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,639
yeah so Peter John right Peter agrees to

361
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,200
pay John that's that's what it says here

362
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,519
right okay

363
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,060
um now if I were to let's say extract

364
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,540
the docx file from here

365
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,800
no idea how to do that export attachment

366
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,779
I usually stop on the zip files

367
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,839
um

368
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,399
permission denied okay

369
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,839
okay

370
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,260
let me clear up some okay there we go

371
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,160
let's try again

372
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,420
so remember it was Peter O's

373
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,079
oh John Let's okay there we go

374
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,800
now

375
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,899
let's open up this desk file

376
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:13,139
and by the way I could have made it it

377
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,480
um nicer of course right the the fonts

378
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,360
are you know suspicious

379
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,040
um there we go right the the Box

380
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,839
suspicious it's it's a matter of design

381
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,639
I didn't want anyone to fall for it so

382
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,380
and here it says John

383
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,839
agrees to play Peter

384
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,300
um let's open it again

385
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,579
John agrees to pay Peter okay let's open

386
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,320
one more time

387
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,500
Peter agrees to pay John right that's

388
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,880
that's a document

389
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,600
um

390
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,899
so who's right I don't know uh

391
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,699
now

392
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,320
um I have some more examples here uh

393
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,740
let's see

394
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,139
oh we have this uh static prayer under

395
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,000
thingy that's even more fun

396
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,220
um so I'm gonna once again open this

397
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,540
with a standing thingy

398
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,779
we're gonna press validate just so that

399
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,240
everyone's happy

400
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,860
and take a look at this oh it's weld

401
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,220
okay if I if I load the preview

402
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,959
it says that

403
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,600
this uh second line it basically says

404
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,920
this document has been opened with

405
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,180
it knows how you open it right if we

406
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,820
extract it once again from here expert

407
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,180
attachment bam

408
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,740
where's the where's my folder and there

409
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,360
it is

410
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,839
okay

411
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,940
we opened that it says this document has

412
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,199
been open normally

413
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,579
and we'll say it every time it's not

414
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,740
it's not a randomized uh randomized

415
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,620
entry here so this is the preview attack

416
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,459
right the pre-render attack uh the E

417
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,680
document Center is a dump piece of a

418
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,500
piece of software so I just loads

419
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,259
whatever I put in there

420
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,759
now but

421
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,819
I'm gonna let's see do I have more demos

422
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,520
oh it's gone I probably do but I'm going

423
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,020
to return to that in a moment

424
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,339
uh let's talk a bit about

425
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,640
about consequences now um

426
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,439
this was cool

427
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,059
um this this one more demo I'm not I'm

428
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,640
not I don't want to show it because this

429
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,559
is this is this I believe is actually

430
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,260
the um most romantic ones by the way

431
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,820
responsible disclosure has been finished

432
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,799
we're gonna it's it's done I can talk

433
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,360
about that right I just feel like maybe

434
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,919
it's not such a good idea

435
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,020
um this one here

436
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,760
um when you open this document it shows

437
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,919
your IP address on the screen uh and it

438
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,059
shows how many times the document has

439
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,440
been open so

440
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,720
um

441
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,880
by the way this attack also works with

442
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,860
GPA with gpg of course any of the

443
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,179
attacks work with gpg because these

444
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:52,260
signatures are resignatures doesn't

445
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,179
matter if your government uh puts their

446
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,160
additional trust in them or not but this

447
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,679
attack also works with LibreOffice

448
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,840
um file formats and all of the attacks

449
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,080
once again also work with uh build in

450
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,820
signatures of LibreOffice now

451
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,140
yes yes so

452
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,200
the real question here is that this is

453
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,340
part of my responsible disclosure

454
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,100
Journey does it really matter do you see

455
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,080
attacks really matter because when

456
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,820
talking to people that are responsible

457
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,320
potentially would be responsible for

458
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,820
fixing this

459
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,740
um one of them pointed out hey this is

460
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,780
not new this has been you know published

461
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,460
on some obscure mailing list 16 years

462
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,539
ago

463
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,539
um

464
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,700
so I wonder what what has changed maybe

465
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,320
it doesn't matter right

466
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,840
probably probably doesn't matter maybe

467
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,460
the administrative controls will take

468
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,500
care of risks right there's fraud with

469
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,660
paper signatures too you could for

470
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,760
example examine the forensically examine

471
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,100
the the signed document

472
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,919
and in the document you would see these

473
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,640
suspicious randomizations right

474
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,679
there it would be apparent the document

475
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,539
has been tampered with uh you would be

476
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,340
probably prosecuted if the document is

477
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,740
of any any Financial value right if you

478
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,480
were trying to defraud uh your your

479
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,380
business partner or something

480
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,380
now therefore

481
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,760
the research um so I I discovered this

482
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,940
uh I think end of 2020

483
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,120
um and we we started really really got

484
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,620
everyone around the table

485
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,120
um about about a bit more than a year

486
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,539
ago uh mid-2021

487
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,419
and we talked to the National third we

488
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:37,980
talked to the national government the

489
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,240
organization is responsible for

490
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,160
Signature safety and we talked and we

491
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,620
talked uh some of the partners tried

492
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,260
bringing some other European Partners on

493
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,580
board

494
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,179
and the response we got is that most of

495
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,039
the other European countries do not want

496
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,760
to touch this with a 10-foot pole like

497
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,700
we started feeling like maybe maybe it

498
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,260
doesn't really matter maybe no one just

499
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,840
knows how to fix it

500
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,899
um

501
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,580
now we decided to push forward what if

502
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,780
we could make a document that appeared

503
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,900
100 legit if forensic examination can't

504
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,020
directly prove any malice

505
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,600
remote content right because we have

506
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,059
remote content and emails um it would

507
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,820
make sense that that someone somewhere

508
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,120
right exports an email to a PDF or saves

509
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,440
it as a doc and it it just works so

510
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,039
why not

511
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,179
and then we realized after talking with

512
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:46,500
all the all the parties in here

513
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,360
it cannot be solved technologically

514
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,120
there's nothing you can do as a say

515
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,880
programmer or system designer to

516
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,620
to solve the problem

517
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,140
it also can't be sold politically

518
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,700
we felt like it needs both

519
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,460
so European Union really likes their

520
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,320
regulations and if it says you can sign

521
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,120
isos and all files you have to be able

522
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,460
to sign isos and Alpha but we believe

523
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,740
the problem is uh the technological

524
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,240
implementation of the political will

525
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,220
here

526
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,559
somehow someone or probably a group of

527
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,280
smart people somewhere in the EU decided

528
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,660
let's well personally I think they

529
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,240
didn't decide that I just Overlook the

530
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,059
fact that we do not want to sign bits

531
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,559
when we sign documents we want to sign

532
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,559
representation of what we see which is

533
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,340
the solution that that we were proposing

534
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,140
but once again the partner didn't want

535
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,659
to touch uh that that was a 10-foot pole

536
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,400
so now my personal

537
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,000
um

538
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,940
personal Challenge and personal Vendetta

539
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,100
if you will is just go to as many

540
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,080
conferences as possible as wide as

541
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,520
possible and talk about this so someone

542
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,020
finally

543
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,539
um you know want

544
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,760
to fix this problem

545
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,539
um

546
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,940
now for the Q a

547
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,880
um I usually I usually end with this

548
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,940
um if you feel like I'm wrong this is

549
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,820
one of one of those talks where a

550
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,320
question that is more like of an opinion

551
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,200
is okay uh just just say it if you feel

552
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,659
like there is more we can do

553
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:22,100
I'd love to hear it thank you

554
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,940
[Applause]

555
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,039
yes

556
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,240
here

557
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,100
thank you

558
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,799
um I think you're completely correct

559
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,440
that this is broken and also that

560
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,900
everybody is correct that we say won't

561
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,039
fix until it's really on fire so I'm in

562
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,900
all favor of setting it completely on

563
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,059
fire

564
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,720
um do Dynamic medicine receipts that you

565
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,820
can multiple times use you know all this

566
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,919
kind of that will get you in a

567
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,740
ton of legal trouble but

568
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,179
um

569
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,360
yes as you can prove that you didn't

570
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,520
personally profit from it and I think it

571
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,020
might be doable

572
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,240
okay thank you and you can you can join

573
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,860
in right this is quite easy I didn't

574
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,799
show you the technical steps but if you

575
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,600
look at the formats it's it's quite easy

576
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,360
now while while the Q a goes first I'm

577
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,179
going to put the put put up the the

578
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,340
the technical part on

579
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,620
so you can participate so you can

580
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,000
partake

581
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,860
any more questions

582
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,720
yes guy thank you for your presentation

583
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,380
and uh it's it's a good one especially

584
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,919
with the gift changing GIF right but um

585
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,260
you know we tend to to think we hear

586
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,539
like computer users and we tend to think

587
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,760
as computers but this ultimately comes

588
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,559
to court and to people you know and to

589
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,780
their decision and I guess these are

590
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,520
rare cases you know how many times you

591
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,380
saw someone trying to pursue someone

592
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,260
else to you know like science uh

593
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,240
changing gift right

594
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,600
so uh practically this is possible but I

595
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,220
think no one no one really uses it and

596
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,200
that's why no one tackles it tackles it

597
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,880
because this is not real concern yet

598
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,740
because ultimately it comes to some

599
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,080
Court it comes to some judge and you

600
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,419
know like and then that you know that

601
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,700
judge asks himself you know who would

602
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,799
even sign you know like changing given

603
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,600
what was the intent of the of the person

604
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,940
you know like pursuing other person

605
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,880
signing this gift right so uh I think

606
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,159
this is the people problem and and not

607
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,140
the the computer problems and me we too

608
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,299
often I think as computers that's that's

609
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:32,520
the thing I myself included right but

610
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,980
finally I you know I just decided that

611
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,659
this is something that you know like

612
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:38,400
people people should should deal with

613
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,919
not computers right no that's that

614
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:42,659
that's a fair point right

615
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:45,419
um and I completely agree that this is a

616
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:48,059
this is this is a a call that we often

617
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:51,419
fall into as as computer scientists

618
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:53,700
um now now here I do have an answer to

619
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,440
that for remote content that is why I

620
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,360
find remote content more more difficult

621
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,440
right

622
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,500
um I might say we want

623
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,320
to be able to uh control

624
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,059
when our document is opened right we

625
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:07,980
want to be able to to see how many times

626
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,559
it has been opened and it is a valid I'm

627
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,179
I mean I haven't gone to court about

628
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,000
that but I feel it's a valid uh purpose

629
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,679
seeing how tracking pixels are

630
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,700
completely legal everywhere

631
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,940
yeah I I agree with with the

632
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,980
this guy that told you that we should

633
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,200
set it on fire so when it you know like

634
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,940
really starts being on fire you know

635
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,100
people we deal with it that I'm sure but

636
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,080
right now it's not

637
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,620
I agree

638
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,240
so here's the the technical thing right

639
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,360
those of you revolving the screen I

640
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,340
opened up the doctor's file it had this

641
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,320
all object in there and and there's

642
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,299
there's a formula that's how it works

643
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,460
basically right and in a sec I'm also

644
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,159
going to show you the pre-rendered part

645
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,279
yeah for this attack will still work but

646
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,860
for websites uh we have since years and

647
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,960
days that you include the hash of the

648
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,840
object you're downloading so

649
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,419
um it's not about the content but at

650
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,820
least it's verified content so you

651
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,340
cannot change the IP address and so

652
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,380
including a hash again from also

653
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,740
including a hash from the Audi object

654
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,299
and from the images and videos inside

655
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,820
your NASA document would solve that a

656
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,020
little bit

657
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,320
not everybody does that and it's it's

658
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,240
very easy to be attackable that's

659
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,059
correct but in websites they found this

660
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,460
already and solved it a little bit in

661
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,080
web design I haven't thought about that

662
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,419
that's really good okay so this is the

663
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,279
pre-render right it's just an just an

664
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,140
image.emf some some I guess it's some

665
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,760
old windows format

666
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,919
um and that's what it does and one could

667
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,539
theoretically or practically go in here

668
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,360
and replace it and to put it back

669
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,320
yeah

670
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,140
and uh maybe to add to the previous one

671
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,080
something like ipfs or content based

672
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,700
addressing could also help with

673
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,820
combating remote content being dynamic

674
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,039
yeah

675
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,760
why not

676
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,779
I mean yes it uh first of all ipfs

677
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:12,720
should burn for very other reasons but

678
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,880
apart from that

679
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,460
yes I'm looking at you cloudflare apart

680
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,539
from that

681
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:19,380
um

682
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,299
the only thing you know with remote

683
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,580
content that's the content is the same

684
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,400
but as with JavaScript I'm very well

685
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,860
including a bad Library it's still going

686
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,600
to execute the bad Library so if it's

687
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,240
Dynamic content if it's Dynamic HTML or

688
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,659
whatever GIF what you do remotely the

689
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:38,880
perceived problems still exists so it

690
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,580
will not solve that problem

691
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,220
okay um anything else yep uh yeah I have

692
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,559
a question actually about the signing of

693
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,159
the uh perceived document so would that

694
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,100
kind of entail that you render it to PNG

695
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,860
or something relatively easy to

696
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,679
interpret and then sign those as well

697
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,740
yes yes I was I was going more from for

698
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,919
BMP which has less bugs uh than PNG but

699
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,940
yes okay

700
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,000
and uh if if I didn't really cover the

701
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,460
the political solution Parts here uh I

702
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,179
feel like uh ability to sign MP3s is

703
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:21,600
probably necessary to some people in

704
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,360
similar cases so we should have that but

705
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,100
for digital signatures for documents we

706
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,360
should have a separate standard that

707
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,039
that does what we talked about just now

708
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,380
yeah but this comes all from the

709
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,059
cardested standard CA small Des uh what

710
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,820
I extended it to sades with the X4

711
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,360
documents and the P bad s for PDF so

712
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,559
that's where the standard comes from

713
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,919
it's just standard rfcs in the end yeah

714
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,440
and then we include time stamping which

715
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,080
is another hell hole in itself are you

716
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,340
saying the way to approach this we

717
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,960
should write a new RFC and and then the

718
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,799
government will take it over

719
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,480
okay I think we don't have any other

720
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,279
questions so thank you everyone for

721
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:05,980
attending

722
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,010
