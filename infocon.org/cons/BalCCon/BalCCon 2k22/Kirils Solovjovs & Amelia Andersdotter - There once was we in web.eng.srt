2
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,130
thank you

3
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,300
[Music]

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,680
if we're ready then let's go

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,159
three two mark

6
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,620
so these days the internet

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,380
is full of different

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,100
apps

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,760
and these apps have done something we

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,760
think is not the best for the community

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,500
on the internet

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,879
which is why

13
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,879
we want to talk to you today not only

14
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,460
about the apps it's also about

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,559
everything that has happened to the

16
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,719
community on internet over the past many

17
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,160
tens of years

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,600
so our basic audio

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,519
is that there used to be a

20
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,100
good web an internet where people were

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,540
talking to each other making

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,479
Communications having a dialogue and

23
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,119
that were now increasingly stuck in all

24
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,640
of these uh deadly sins of one-way

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,680
communication where people send each

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,900
other pictures of their latest outfit or

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,960
what they ate and it's all broadcast

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,640
it's all about having the maximum amount

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,680
of followers while having the fewest

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,180
amount of people that you are yourself

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,520
listening to

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,500
and so what we hope that we will convey

33
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,920
to you in the upcoming 50 minutes is

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,259
um firstly why be profoundly disagree

35
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,900
with this way of organizing the internet

36
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,180
and also how we believe that we might be

37
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,640
able to make steps

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,640
to get to a better place both using

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,460
technological and social needs

40
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,020
so why is the internet different now

41
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,320
than it was in the beginning do you

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,280
remember

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,200
I don't see anyone with that much gray

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,720
hair when arpanet was created

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,619
just before the 70s right it was

46
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,580
it was quite different now why was that

47
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,920
the case

48
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,640
now being old on the internet is not

49
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,599
easy

50
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,700
what is the first time that you used the

51
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,620
internet actually

52
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,599
um I think it was I was under 10 years

53
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,580
old and I was going to this extra

54
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,800
curricular activity because at home I

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,840
didn't even have a PC I had a Soviet

56
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,180
clone of their Spectrum

57
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,420
um and it was it was it was really

58
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,580
really great yeah so we were doing lots

59
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,340
of exploration back in back in before

60
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,920
before 2000 yeah we were playing uh

61
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,220
Quake 1990s yeah that was quite cool

62
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,620
so this here right this uh this text you

63
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,760
can read it

64
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,099
um you can read it and say what what the

65
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,300
hell is that

66
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,680
or

67
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,319
you can read it and immediately have the

68
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,570
right tune pop up in your head

69
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:12,200
[Music]

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,400
I don't think that's the right tune I

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,720
think it's out of key but we've been

72
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,640
disagreeing on this for about two days

73
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,319
that's that's what the presentation is

74
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,560
about as disagreeing here on stage

75
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,200
so but since this is a hacker conference

76
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,940
where a kind of security conference we

77
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,340
have to talk about security of course

78
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,099
now I believe that when internet was

79
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,480
first grade and I wasn't there I'm not

80
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,000
that old because when I started using

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,920
internet we were doing uh we were

82
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,620
playing Quake but there were already I

83
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,239
guess people that were that were hacking

84
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,760
stuff but back back before then in the

85
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,879
70s uh in the in the arpanet I do

86
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,680
believe that there were less malicious

87
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,560
hacking taking place but you would have

88
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,360
had less malicious hacking taking place

89
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,040
on arpanet because you would have had

90
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,799
mostly wealthy white guys at top level

91
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,220
U.S universities so that makes sense but

92
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,860
I sort of disagree I take issue with the

93
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,480
uh fact that people wouldn't have been

94
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,319
violating loss or social norms per se in

95
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,720
the 1980s or in the 1990s you have a few

96
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,840
extravagant examples of

97
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,579
hacking the US military or hacking

98
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,738
governments or using credit cards to

99
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,660
make fraudulent purchases I mean these

100
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,180
things did exist of course it was fun it

101
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,820
was and those are just a few examples we

102
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,680
didn't have commercial or rather

103
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,259
organized crime hackers back then uh but

104
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:32,820
we did have some bad apples but it was

105
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,300
it was a tons of fun so um but these

106
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,560
days

107
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,660
I believe more and more

108
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,540
that lots of security

109
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,759
is actually about preserving privacy

110
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,340
some users don't care but then we care

111
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,020
for them

112
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,699
but other users really care about that

113
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,560
so

114
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,060
we can look at some of the difficulties

115
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,919
of preserving privacy when you say

116
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,560
hacking in this context you or security

117
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,600
cleaning the hacker

118
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,979
hacker yes of course

119
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,580
the full one

120
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,300
um

121
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,340
yeah

122
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,479
that's a cure for me to say something

123
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,120
about how I don't this how I don't agree

124
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,740
that we're necessarily having services

125
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,740
that only exploit our privacy

126
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,000
I do believe that there's somehow

127
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,340
an unwarranted worry with the older part

128
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,840
of the population to which I count

129
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,300
myself these days that the kids aren't

130
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,919
caring about privacy in the services

131
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,800
they use on the contrary I think if you

132
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,840
look at services that teenagers try to

133
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,820
get on these days they're very often

134
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,979
anonymity and privacy focused

135
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,199
they will use Kik which doesn't have

136
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,940
permanent identifiers or permanent

137
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,740
Messengers they will use stuff like

138
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,900
Snapchat where the messages disappear

139
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,240
after 24 hours and this example here is

140
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,919
not one of the services we just put it

141
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,620
there because everyone's Anonymous on

142
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,039
Fortune

143
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,000
and so then you have a lot of adults

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,680
complaining about how the kids are on

145
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,240
these Anonymous Services because it

146
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,580
allows them to post profane messages or

147
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,940
engage in bullying and so uh somehow the

148
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,620
kids are still hacking the system even

149
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,820
though we're having all of these big

150
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,820
services that are trying to cover up

151
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,620
um data which is a nice message of hope

152
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,230
I think

153
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,220
[Music]

154
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,380
now let's talk about the good stuff

155
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,780
right and for everyone I believe that's

156
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,520
just human nature the good stuff is is

157
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,919
when you were a kid right before that it

158
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,720
doesn't doesn't really exist we had to

159
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,639
research specifically maybe maybe not

160
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,139
this year right but at some point in our

161
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,240
lives we had to research what arpanet is

162
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,340
how it worked and and how are people

163
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,860
feeling on it but your childhood that's

164
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,960
that's a good times and

165
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,479
we had a lot of good stuff

166
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,720
during during that when I was little I

167
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,370
came on the IRC because I met some I

168
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,479
[Music]

169
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,220
put a science fiction and I liked

170
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,600
reading books

171
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,699
and he told me I definitely needed to be

172
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,160
on the IRC and eventually I ended up in

173
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,280
an MP3 80s channel on fnet and this is

174
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,919
why I still to this day listen to Italo

175
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:05,880
disco

176
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,280
you know the difference between IRC and

177
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,039
and what we have these days is the

178
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,500
agency that users had they they could

179
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,300
basically self-organize even though we

180
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,120
had some um we we had these sysadmins or

181
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,180
csops was the name uh but generally uh

182
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,759
at least in in the region that that uh

183
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,220
I'm from they kept out of the channel

184
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,599
business they were running the server

185
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,860
they were they were dealing with

186
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,720
hardcore spammers and it was it was

187
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,280
quite effective but this was definitely

188
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,680
the case also in in Sweden so we haven't

189
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,479
actually introduced ourselves that much

190
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,759
but uh curiels is from Latvia and I'm

191
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,099
from Sweden so normally we're from very

192
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,080
different parts of the world right like

193
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,080
right nearby well okay so there's a but

194
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,419
there's a c a part yes I think in the

195
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,039
time period that we're talking about you

196
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,319
have these all of these societal changes

197
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,479
that were going on especially around

198
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,900
1990 when we were both alive by the way

199
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,740
uh so um IRC wasn't the only thing we

200
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,960
also had had chats right for example we

201
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,060
had the web chats and that would be some

202
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,580
separate third party setting up web chat

203
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,319
not a bridge to rrc just a separate chat

204
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,840
where you can go and chat and users like

205
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,460
the users users not the not the

206
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,560
proficient hacker users uh they would

207
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,240
they would go and use those but when you

208
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,919
told them that there's this IRC it was a

209
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,479
freedom and all they would switch over

210
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,099
quite quickly and quite willingly

211
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:23,879
actually

212
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,220
and it was places where anyone from any

213
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,720
different geographical background could

214
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,819
go and talk to anyone from any other

215
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,640
particular Geographic background

216
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,880
um but yes less segmented yeah for file

217
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,860
sharing we had well they had before our

218
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,440
time they had FTP uh we had DC plus plus

219
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,599
which was which was really fun

220
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,620
um I remember that one of the ways to

221
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,839
encourage people to share

222
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,640
stuff they made or some other stuff that

223
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,800
they have on their computer

224
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,140
was to to actually have quotas unless

225
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,240
you have like 10 gigabytes or I think

226
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,680
back then it was probably a gigabyte

227
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,440
right a half gigabyte of share you are

228
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,240
not allowed to download more than that

229
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,100
and it was a real thing and what

230
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,160
happened back back in Latvia uh is that

231
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,899
the government employees were using DC

232
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,940
plus and they wanted to download stuff

233
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,040
so they just shared the network share to

234
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,600
the C plus plus and you could just go

235
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,700
and go and download stuff that was fun

236
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,160
I can imagine

237
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,360
BitTorrent came along after afterwards

238
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,459
right and it's still it feels like it's

239
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,839
been a long time because it has been a

240
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,339
long time sorry it's worth your bubble

241
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,980
if you don't think you're you're old

242
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,560
um and be turned made things better

243
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,060
right we still have some private

244
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,920
trackers I guess that actually uh limit

245
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,339
how much what what share radio ratio you

246
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,019
need but it's a it's a newer Ambassador

247
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,720
technology back before that way before

248
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,060
that we had Usenet

249
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,100
right do you know that one of the most

250
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,959
shocking experiences of my life was

251
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,640
moving to Belgium

252
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,440
and then realizing that in Belgium

253
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,820
because they didn't have good internet

254
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,880
connections in the 1990s or just in

255
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,360
general at any point of history people

256
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,339
don't have these experiences at all

257
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,500
because they conform a lot with what I

258
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,600
know from my youth growing up you know

259
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,040
maybe not government employees wearing

260
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,899
covered encouraged to use BitTorrent

261
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,360
precisely but there's not a single Swede

262
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,040
my age that wouldn't know about all of

263
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,120
these things

264
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,700
whereas in Belgium and France and

265
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,519
Germany people by and large have not had

266
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,740
affordable good internet access because

267
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,720
they've been stuck on ADSL networks and

268
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,200
so they're just somehow not part of this

269
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,600
community that that we have I think it's

270
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,480
very strange right having your own IP

271
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,040
address being able to run your own

272
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,899
server that was uh that was a really

273
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,760
important part of it

274
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,380
um we read a couple of Articles

275
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,040
preparing for for this talk how people

276
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,440
reflect on on the past and I remember

277
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,000
that I should have actually put the

278
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,399
picture in I have a picture I have a I'm

279
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,660
going to describe it since we didn't do

280
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,560
that

281
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,140
um I had a bet I had a large large bed

282
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,060
basically half my room was the bed and

283
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,860
at the end of the bed there were like

284
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,779
three computers three monitors the CRT

285
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:04,860
mentors of course there's three

286
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,899
keyboards on top of them and uh one one

287
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,120
was for the router which was Linux box

288
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,680
one was for the server which was Linux

289
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,480
box and one was for the desktop which

290
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,880
was Windows 98 and after Windows 98

291
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,160
stopped working it was a Linux box

292
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,880
um

293
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,279
and

294
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,500
these days well these days it's harder

295
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,579
probably right but we're talking about

296
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:24,720
the good stuff here right the good old

297
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,100
days so you could run your own server

298
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,959
you could you could whatever you want

299
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,180
right I remember it it was in the 90s

300
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,480
anymore it was around 2004 2003 I think

301
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,180
I started running kailera anyone heard

302
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,760
of the protocol or the or the service

303
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,060
yeah yeah okay so kailera is a gaming

304
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,700
server that allows you to uh basically

305
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,579
two parties or maybe more but I think

306
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,079
yeah more than two more than one party

307
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,260
connect and game and old emulator games

308
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,899
through the internet uh it's terrible

309
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,019
it's it's it's uh

310
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,959
it loses it loses sink it desynchronizes

311
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,760
and but it was everything we had and it

312
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,500
was so great to be able to you know to

313
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,760
play with with your friends because

314
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,440
people move around right they start

315
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,120
growing up

316
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,060
um RSS the log over here that's a that's

317
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,980
a different story uh it's kind of

318
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,459
holding I think onto its life it's still

319
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:21,480
here but it's it's it's barely right and

320
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,600
that's that's a paradox because uh

321
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,740
nowadays you're supposed to use the app

322
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,560
yes that's the thing no one no one

323
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,920
forbids you to use RSS and uh some

324
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,880
people

325
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,920
um I personally I have a Blog I haven't

326
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,700
posted anything in a couple years 10 I

327
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,660
think

328
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,779
um and it has a recessed output feed and

329
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,420
all of these old pages that still work

330
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,880
they still have the feeds but it is

331
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,680
actually telling you is that if you want

332
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,260
to subscribe to an RSS feed where you

333
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,540
have no risk of ever receiving an update

334
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,940
his blog is right there carols.com yes

335
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,279
that's that's the Vlog right

336
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,440
hmm

337
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,060
um but because of all the open

338
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,040
Technologies back back in those days it

339
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,480
was also easier to start up service

340
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,740
providers

341
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,279
um be it an actual ISP or or a virtual

342
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,139
service provider like uh like a web page

343
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,180
like a blog like like a new site I

344
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,779
remember friends from uh from from

345
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:21,000
Neighbors basically started an ISP and

346
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,279
and I connected to them and I got I got

347
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,720
a subnet immediately I just asked hey

348
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,399
can I get a summons yeah sure there you

349
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,040
go there's there's a slash eight oh

350
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,339
sorry there's such uh I get I got eight

351
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:35,459
AP addresses that's slash 30-29 that's

352
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,420
29 yes

353
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,260
these all these and we had the memes of

354
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,519
course right this is a relatively new

355
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,279
meme uh the the design of it but the

356
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,200
content some of you will will recognize

357
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,680
as quite quite an old meme I guess

358
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,820
now

359
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,399
these days

360
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,639
social networks basically Survive by

361
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,260
ingesting

362
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,899
your data

363
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,959
now what we have created here and by we

364
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,899
I mean not not us someone else uh but

365
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,079
but we are all party I guess to this

366
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:12,660
extension extension of of the

367
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,459
of the good old internet right what what

368
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,920
has been created here uh is a system

369
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,079
where the

370
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,779
big players the big networks the big

371
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,540
apps basically say you got to stay

372
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,820
normal you can't be you can't be

373
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,440
Advanced you can't be a hacker stay

374
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,480
normal obey slave this is these are the

375
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,380
rules

376
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,740
it's either my rules or the highway

377
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,560
right so

378
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,360
there are multiple problems with that

379
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,399
and we're gonna we're gonna go over

380
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,680
that was We're Not Gonna

381
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,560
we can touch upon those right uh one of

382
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,480
those that I personally feel strongly

383
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,260
about

384
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,540
is

385
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,639
decentralized usernames and it's not

386
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,339
exactly the fault of having those paid

387
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,519
Services right but let's say who's the

388
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,180
youngest person here

389
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,139
let's say young person today or start

390
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,540
using the internet and decides okay I

391
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,459
want to I want to have my presence

392
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,320
online

393
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,660
so let's say the person is called uh

394
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,480
John Smith or or Carol salovious right

395
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,220
and then and they go and try to register

396
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,880
a nice handle on Twitter a Facebook page

397
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,680
Instagram account

398
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,540
all these accounts that actually have

399
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,279
handles I remember as a security

400
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,079
professional which is which is my day

401
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,339
job

402
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,680
um we were we were advocating for years

403
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,139
just very recently uh to stop using

404
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,459
emails

405
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,440
um email name email names email account

406
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,380
names uh as usernames on on third-party

407
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,600
services because that opens up to to

408
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,839
password the password stuffing attacks

409
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,279
well they kind of did that you still

410
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,600
have the email as the username but you

411
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,339
also have a username you have you have

412
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,620
your handle and the problem is you

413
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,959
cannot realistically get the same handle

414
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,779
everywhere now back in the day but I

415
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:02,940
understand it may be very subjective you

416
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,980
could just go and and and arrange the

417
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,839
handle because everything was run by

418
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,899
your friends right maybe these days it

419
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,100
works the same for some other people

420
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,680
that know Jack Dorsey or whoever runs

421
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,040
filter now

422
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,779
I mean so I think the big difference

423
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:22,440
between Social Network Services and um

424
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,980
the IRC or all of the good stuff that we

425
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,500
used to experience on the past is how

426
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,440
they use code encoded environments to

427
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,100
lock people into predefined behaviors

428
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,839
um and make it very difficult to stray

429
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:38,759
outside it's very difficult to reach

430
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,620
outside of your already existing social

431
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,420
bubbles it's very difficult to reach

432
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,420
outside of what somebody says that you

433
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,940
should reasonably interested in so this

434
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,399
is has been described in literature as

435
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,320
the filter bubble

436
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,620
and I think this is what we mean by

437
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,220
um

438
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,000
you know platforms

439
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,220
platforms forcing people into restricted

440
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,799
sets of behaviors but I'm not entirely

441
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,720
sure that I agree that decentralized

442
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,160
user names is that big of a problem

443
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,839
shouldn't we normally think that having

444
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,299
a separate

445
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,919
interaction with each Company still is

446
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,900
somehow good

447
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,359
it's safer it's safer I guess yes but

448
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,220
what about tlds then top level domains

449
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,799
right back in the day we had what we had

450
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,059
um 10 gtlds and a bunch of country uh

451
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,460
tlds and if you wanted if you were let's

452
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,780
say

453
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,480
IBM they didn't do that interestingly

454
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,760
enough but if you're a BM you could get

455
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,760
all the gtlds just in case now these

456
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,660
days dot dot Google what the

457
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,940
I agree with that I have sort of a funny

458
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,179
counter example to this being upsetting

459
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,340
um and also maybe it's a local anecdotes

460
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,840
from Sweden which doesn't concern me

461
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,460
personally but somebody who was very

462
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,260
instrumental in setting up the Swedish

463
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,200
internet architecture got uh his first

464
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,799
name.se when the CCT system was first

465
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,860
introduced and then it was accidentally

466
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,700
also later in history the name of a

467
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,160
profitable online casino that bought the

468
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,080
domain name from him for a large sum of

469
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,539
money that is not disclosed oh profit I

470
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,919
like that yeah but he got the domain

471
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,179
name for free because he knew the guys

472
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:22,080
who were operating the registry in 1992

473
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,820
that's how I got one of my domain names

474
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,559
yeah yeah I just asked hey this is

475
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,660
reserved why is it reserved so I guess

476
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,460
one of the problems of that model that

477
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,140
was back in the 90s even though it

478
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,640
created a lot of Liberties for the

479
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,140
people who were there

480
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,820
is that it also relied a lot on

481
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,380
interpersonal relations and you would

482
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,299
say nepotism

483
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,039
that of course if you are a part of the

484
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,840
nepotistic system and you benefit from

485
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,020
it you're more like oh yeah

486
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,120
enjoy it yeah but if you're not part of

487
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,860
it then it's not so great for you would

488
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,120
you know Amelia your argument about

489
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,460
about TLD actually actually makes sense

490
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,039
yes because I did manage to register

491
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,740
curious.lv cures.com curls.org curls.net

492
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,960
don't open all of those there are all

493
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,700
different pages but don't go looking I

494
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,559
can't even get Ambush doctor that I see

495
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,000
even though it's a very unique surname

496
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,500
that only me and my sisters have

497
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,919
but I think the other thing about the

498
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,980
hackard community which is very nice and

499
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,480
that I think all of these collaborative

500
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,640
services from the 90s and early 2000s

501
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,559
brought into the picture was it's very

502
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,760
constructive

503
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,919
so some of the things that kids has been

504
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,480
talking about setting up your own gaming

505
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,059
servers you getting your own Usenet

506
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,620
server whatever playing around with

507
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,020
protocols it's a constructive form of

508
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,260
in-group to be in basically you screw

509
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,280
something up

510
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,860
and then you fix it and then all of your

511
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,260
peers all of your friends like you more

512
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,080
it's a kind of in-group status game that

513
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,419
in many other communities and I think

514
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,640
especially of uh some of the ones we see

515
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,919
on Instagram or social medias they're

516
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:54,780
represented more by being able to

517
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,660
perform transactions like I can buy food

518
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,580
I can buy a car I can buy makeup you

519
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,380
know it's a very transactional form of

520
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,780
status game that I don't think is very

521
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,940
good either for the human spirit

522
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,039
or for Society at large it's like

523
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,440
narcissism at a very large scale the

524
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,200
hacker Community by contrast is is

525
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,320
constructive only by self-improvement do

526
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,559
you become somebody to gain respect that

527
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,280
gains respect

528
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,760
um

529
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,799
but I think that there are reasons for

530
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,960
why we've seen some of the demise of

531
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,580
these internet communities

532
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,419
that go beyond uh just the fact that me

533
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,840
and kirils are now in our 30s

534
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,700
and it's a commodification

535
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,080
we've had centralization of Internet

536
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,419
service provision and we've had

537
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:51,419
centralization of web service provision

538
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,240
as well okay I mean we can say like back

539
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,120
in the 1980s they were laying

540
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,620
transatlantic cables and they're also

541
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,299
form of centralized architecture there's

542
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,580
always been one level of uh

543
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,160
centralization and in Internet I mean

544
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,520
the basic like backhaul network uh but

545
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,020
now we're seeing that centralization

546
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,039
also um uh locally happening so if in

547
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,600
the past you used to be able to run your

548
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,280
own internet service provider and set

549
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,860
one up uh nowadays increasingly you

550
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,720
cannot the regulatory burden on

551
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,000
operating Commercial Services for amp

552
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,280
consumers it's just too high nobody's

553
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,039
saying would set up a network for an

554
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,559
apartment building even just having an

555
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,200
internet service provider in the city

556
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,940
nowadays is probably outside of the

557
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,520
realm of the possible for most companies

558
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,860
administratively because of the types of

559
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,380
permissions and restrictions and Hoops

560
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,880
you need to go through with regulatory

561
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,659
authorities and we may want to deny that

562
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,880
at least I know I do but it also applies

563
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,400
to services on the internet not just the

564
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,380
companies that pull out physical wires

565
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,140
what moved the popularity of a website

566
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,240
back in the day well the internet was

567
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,240
basically a big social network

568
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,340
Tim created the world wide web

569
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,520
the hyperlink and if your site was

570
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,500
popular people would link to it people

571
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,780
would talk about it

572
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:20,159
no ads no search engine optimization I

573
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,460
remember when I created my blog

574
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,679
we wanted some ads so we invented some

575
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,840
ads instead of advertising something

576
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,580
useful we were advertising each other

577
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,520
and for example for my blog there was a

578
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,400
rotation and every every next request

579
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,039
there was different Banner to a

580
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:40,860
different Latvian Latvian blogger so we

581
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,179
didn't have

582
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,159
what Google started right search engine

583
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,659
optimization which basically started

584
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:49,140
with Google and the and their algorithm

585
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,240
I think also some of these websites they

586
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,320
were just sort of politically

587
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,500
inconvenient right that you have a bunch

588
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,179
of different people writing on blogs

589
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,159
about their own separate opinions and

590
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,620
making citizen journalism in a way that

591
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,620
uh challenged mainstream media and I

592
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,179
know at least in large parts of Western

593
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,880
Europe you have these media subsidy

594
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,559
systems where the government goes in and

595
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,179
helps for instance newspapers with

596
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,280
distribution costs

597
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,140
um and all of that was challenged by the

598
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,059
fact that now anyone can sit around them

599
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:22,140
poke in uh Municipal Affairs or some

600
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,559
government proposal or the activities of

601
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,539
a large corporation just by having a

602
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:31,980
website so um creating a website is

603
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,980
super easy these days you buy domain for

604
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,780
one one dollar next year it's like 20

605
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,340
but first year you buy it for one dollar

606
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,200
and you have a website but creating a

607
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,840
functioning socially functioning website

608
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,159
um is basically impossible these days

609
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,140
even you have the social networks like

610
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,140
if you go way back to the 1990s or the

611
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,659
2000s early

612
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:53,220
the terms of service for one of the most

613
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,840
popular Platforms in Sweden was

614
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,419
literally six paragraphs now there is no

615
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:58,980
way that you will get on a website where

616
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,179
you can actually talk to another

617
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:03,059
physical human being in whatever form

618
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:06,240
without signing on to 10 pages of legal

619
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,799
documentation about how you were meant

620
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:10,320
to litigate in California right so it's

621
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,940
all super super serious there are

622
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,559
companies doing these things and and

623
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,559
they are kind of pushing out like if you

624
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,860
wanted to create let's say a social

625
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,740
network where people can post stories

626
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,500
that are limited in size say up to 140

627
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,840
or 280 characters you could you could do

628
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,600
that but will you get the user base and

629
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,679
that is something that we've been

630
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,000
thinking about not only preparing for

631
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,100
the presentation but but all the time

632
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,620
because we need to find solutions for

633
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,799
that

634
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,960
another part that I think really changed

635
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,940
how people were interacting

636
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,220
um and that we've been discussing a lot

637
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,039
back and forth is uh the major shift in

638
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,419
internet connectivity that happened

639
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,480
around 2012.

640
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,200
um so a large number of users that we

641
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,000
find today on the internet didn't

642
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,340
actually join connectivity until after

643
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,460
the LTE Revolution so this is when

644
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,260
people got smartphones and started being

645
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,179
able to send them take pictures with

646
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:10,500
their own photos

647
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,900
and I would argue and I hope kittens

648
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,760
agrees with me but otherwise we can

649
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,460
disagree here on stage that mobile

650
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,220
networks are historically just

651
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,200
architecturally very different from what

652
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,720
the internet

653
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,980
is or was

654
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,740
in the mobile networks assume Central

655
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,580
authorities they're designed for having

656
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,260
nation-state nation-state covering

657
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,539
networks with Central controlling points

658
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,460
which are base stations and then a

659
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,020
commercial entity which covers the

660
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,580
entire territory through a spectrum

661
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,159
license for providing connectivity on

662
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,679
that territory somehow forwarding and

663
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,000
acting as a middleman for anything

664
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,159
that's that is being said and done and

665
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,559
this is just a vastly different model of

666
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,820
connectivity

667
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,460
and how to build infrastructure from

668
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,020
what the internet was designed to be

669
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,940
which is having a large number of

670
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,059
smaller networks which are capable of

671
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:04,080
interoperating and peering with each

672
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,279
other

673
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,559
and so you can see this and what the

674
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,360
different feed functions are that are

675
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,580
meant to be supported by end user

676
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,320
equipment or network service providers

677
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,360
these are some illustrations that I made

678
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,240
for a framework on

679
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,700
human rights and internet

680
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,059
standardization but if so on the left

681
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:25,980
what you have is basically the internet

682
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,240
model for network service provision

683
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,260
um

684
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,900
you see

685
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,240
the end user equipment is the green sort

686
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,419
of column and the yellow column is the

687
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,520
service provider so among the service

688
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,500
providers you have basically three

689
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,880
different places where you can have

690
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,740
different commercial entities performing

691
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,320
completely different tasks and that can

692
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,159
all technologically by Design

693
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,120
interoperate and cooperate with each

694
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,500
other to provide something to the end

695
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,080
users also in the end user equipment you

696
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,460
have a lot of different entities that

697
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,200
need to get together and cooperate for

698
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,760
the end user to do something meaningful

699
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,640
the end user a consumer or a client or

700
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,559
somebody like kittens can choose to

701
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,659
intervene at any stage of that process

702
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,799
and do whatever they want

703
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,039
in the mobile network model on the

704
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,020
contrary they don't use the equipment

705
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,240
that column is on the right well it's

706
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,740
the third column from the left if that's

707
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,260
how you're reading it

708
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,580
has very little influence over what's

709
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,500
going on if you're just somebody who's

710
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,840
relying on the connectivity you need a

711
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,580
SIM card to get access to the network

712
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,980
and then that's basically it from a

713
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,200
connectivity point of view that's where

714
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,460
your interaction with the network

715
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,440
technology stops

716
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,659
it's a very centralized model it leaves

717
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,700
very little flexibility

718
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,100
the network service provider will

719
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,400
Supreme they control all parts of the

720
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,240
stack

721
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,279
and unless you're actually physically

722
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,140
working with somebody that is developing

723
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,140
Network

724
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,640
equipment you're just very unlikely to

725
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,039
have any influence over what the network

726
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,140
is capable of or what the services are

727
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,900
that you can run

728
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,460
and I think the fact that many of the

729
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,900
people who are now getting onto the

730
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,400
internet or that got onto the internet

731
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,520
after 2012 that they're in this mobile

732
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,279
network model that influence what kind

733
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,600
of freedoms that they perceive

734
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,000
themselves to have when interacting with

735
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,120
a smartphone or a computer or with any

736
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,700
type of connected gadgets maybe going

737
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,380
back to an earlier observation that we

738
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,120
make it's not so much that we're old in

739
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,539
the sense of being you know of age

740
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,340
um or that we're in our 30s or whatever

741
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,100
but me and kidils are actually reacting

742
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,600
to is the fact that we got on the

743
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,120
internet before the LTE Revolution we

744
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,640
wanted to be this internet model where

745
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,580
anyone can intervene at any level of the

746
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,860
value chain to do whatever they want

747
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,080
but we find ourselves increasingly

748
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,640
surrounded by these mobile network

749
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,299
people who are of any age really born in

750
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:00,360
any decade but that find themselves very

751
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,799
limited in terms of what they can

752
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,879
architecturally do

753
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:09,900
now back in the day as we discussed for

754
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,279
a lengthy period of time now free

755
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,260
services were actually a thing

756
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,480
as Emilia mentioned we had fewer

757
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,539
regulatory requirements uh in particular

758
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,279
we didn't have to have as many

759
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,620
certifications and permissions right it

760
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,480
came to setting a bank you need a bunch

761
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,179
of certificates and security uh stuff to

762
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,340
do that and for social networks it's

763
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,659
quite similar especially if you're in

764
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,539
the EU you have to abide by the gdpr you

765
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:34,980
have to you have the lawyers and all

766
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,159
that

767
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,720
outside I guess it's not entirely true

768
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,399
that um you need more lawyers now it's

769
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,260
always been possible to sue people on

770
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,760
the Internet or for stuff that was done

771
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,320
on the internet there was just less

772
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,360
jurisprudence in the past I'm not sure

773
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,740
if it was possible because that was a

774
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,419
turning point when was it in Sweden when

775
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,740
someone got sued for uh raping someone

776
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,419
virtually in the virtual Avatar they

777
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,679
actually they changed the law because

778
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,419
because of that it became possible

779
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,340
yeah but there's a bunch of other

780
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,580
regulatory influence as well

781
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,020
like one of the things that I have found

782
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,240
is that whenever we have a law which

783
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,179
somehow mysteriously centralizes the

784
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,539
power over internet architecture or how

785
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:27,120
we build them is that big telcos in

786
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,539
Europe that used to be government owned

787
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:31,919
typically well I will not mention any

788
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,480
names actually because I work in the

789
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,000
Telecommunications sector now

790
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,899
um

791
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:38,880
but uh there's just a bunch of them

792
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,380
there used to be government monopolies

793
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,500
and they have uh their um responsible

794
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,899
for paying out Pension funds to anyone

795
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,399
who's been employed there since the

796
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:49,320
1960s

797
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,659
um and those pension Pension funds needs

798
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:55,620
present day profits to exist so that

799
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,960
means that in order for uh when the

800
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,000
German politician is trying to make an

801
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,159
assessment of what to do politically

802
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,919
they have about 200 000 German old age

803
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,860
pensioners who if a large German

804
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,200
operator is not allowed to do rent

805
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,299
seeking on their consumers they will be

806
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:14,279
forced to eat cat food

807
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,679
and I can sort of see the moral dilemma

808
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,200
for the legislator in this case that

809
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,140
maybe I would also allow

810
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,980
anti-competitive behavior and

811
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,899
centralization of architecture if the

812
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:27,620
alternative was cat food to pensioners

813
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,480
I disagree with the effects though and I

814
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,799
think the pension fund problem should

815
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:33,899
maybe be solved differently if possible

816
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:35,640
but I think it's one of the driving

817
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,679
forces of centralization that we just

818
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,659
have all of these Legacy industries that

819
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:42,380
are consistently getting support by

820
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,700
legislators because they can't keep up

821
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,659
with what a decentralized architectural

822
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:49,620
infrastructure model would actually mean

823
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,039
for them

824
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:55,500
um another part which is now

825
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,360
increasingly driving centralization of

826
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,179
services is security but I don't mean

827
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:01,919
Security in the sense of hacking for

828
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,760
people's privacy more like nation-state

829
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,500
nation-state security that if we're

830
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,140
going to be protecting people from uh

831
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,000
somebody being nasty on Twitter it makes

832
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,880
sense to have more regulated services so

833
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,640
that Twitter can moderate or we're

834
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,679
imagining that a large entity like a big

835
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,779
bank can better put money into

836
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:23,220
developing security for payment

837
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,559
transactions this kind of thing although

838
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,120
that's being challenged a bit by the

839
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,100
fintech sector

840
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,380
um but so there's a bunch of security

841
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,500
related arguments which are used for

842
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,700
centralization now as well basically

843
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,659
it's

844
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:38,940
if it's uh if it's a big and old entity

845
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,100
you can better trust it somehow very

846
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,960
appealing especially in Continental

847
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,659
Europe and then we have copyright of

848
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:48,480
course or or the Mickey Mouse law

849
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,179
um basically I personally I don't know

850
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,380
how you feel about it but personally

851
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,919
feel that copyright is is just wrong

852
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,899
nothing not corporate in general I'm an

853
00:32:57,899 --> 00:32:59,580
author myself I sometimes write

854
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,000
something I I took I take photos but I

855
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,740
don't feel like I need to be able to

856
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,960
benefit from my from the article I wrote

857
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,440
70 years after I'm dead because I won't

858
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,720
care uh personally I don't know I don't

859
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,279
know about others but

860
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,380
the real problem

861
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,179
with copyright is basically this it's

862
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,159
it's it's way too long and so people on

863
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,539
the internet the netizens they try to

864
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:23,700
find ways ways around it and it's

865
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,919
getting uh harder and harder and not not

866
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,659
just not just talking about illegal

867
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:30,000
activities or or what is illegal on the

868
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,620
current law I'm also talking about

869
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,140
personal perfectly normal activities for

870
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,340
example

871
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,559
around

872
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,320
2006 or five I created a file sharing

873
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,659
platform it's it wasn't bit or

874
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:45,059
interesting like that no fancy protocols

875
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,640
it was a web page

876
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,679
um back then so basically these days we

877
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,380
have a mega I think mega.nz is one of

878
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,899
the one of the popular ones back in the

879
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,659
day the best thing you could ask for is

880
00:33:57,659 --> 00:33:59,700
you had like paste the bin kind of

881
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,260
platforms where you upload one file you

882
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,480
get one link so the problem I was

883
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,279
solving was what if I want to upload

884
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,860
like 20 related files I want them all to

885
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,780
be like in one virtual folder so I

886
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,580
created the platform for that and people

887
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,219
use it for personal file transfer it

888
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,899
hasn't taken off even though I was

889
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,239
surprised when I was in a European Union

890
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,699
building once I was using their computer

891
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,800
to browse stuff I tried to transfer a

892
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,980
file and their firewall forbid me it

893
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,418
said this is a file sharing service you

894
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:29,219
are not going to open it so apparently

895
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:31,139
some people are paid to look for stuff

896
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,520
like that on the internet and find it

897
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,599
but the problem for me this copyright

898
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,300
here is that European Union

899
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,060
decided that you know since I'm a

900
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,359
fostering platform I need to start

901
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:46,619
looking after what's being uploaded

902
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:49,440
right if I don't want to get sued and I

903
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,179
have

904
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,159
three users per month I'd say about 20

905
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,619
people per year to use the platform so I

906
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:58,260
cannot afford an AI I hate AIS that are

907
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,599
used for this oppressive purpose and I

908
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,300
cannot afford the 24 7 staff that will

909
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,280
reply to copyright inference requests

910
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,220
now all of that to me shows that we are

911
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,560
losing agency and interns really fast or

912
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,960
we have been for the past decade

913
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,400
these days

914
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,560
you have to have an account

915
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,960
on many pages just to open it

916
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,000
just to read the page I'm not even

917
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,339
talking about all the all the banners

918
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:30,839
you have to click on right I agree to

919
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,339
the cookies yes do you want to be

920
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,160
tracked no are you sure yes okay choose

921
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,180
the platforms you don't want to be

922
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,099
tracked on all that I'm not even talking

923
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,320
about all of that there are more and

924
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,940
more sites where you need to have an

925
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,859
account and then understand the need for

926
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:46,200
financing for good journalism for

927
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,480
example but there has to be

928
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,839
a solution this has to be solved I'm

929
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,220
okay you should have had a solution we

930
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,720
could have had citizen journalism but

931
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,060
then we decided we didn't like it yeah

932
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,119
so people don't know what they want but

933
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,160
I could make the account uh I mean I

934
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,599
could pay but I don't want to make 10

935
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,040
accounts right if there was just a

936
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,680
button that that can be pressed right

937
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,640
um

938
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,440
a phone number

939
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,380
famously on this stage I think also uh

940
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,180
I've given the presentation on on

941
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,359
privacy about three years ago those who

942
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:20,339
were here remember that I live without a

943
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:21,359
phone number

944
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,300
well not like uh not like one of the

945
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,320
audience members here who actually

946
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,320
doesn't have a phone number

947
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,180
but I do tell companies I don't have

948
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,920
phone number because it's way too hard

949
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,140
to explain that I don't want to give you

950
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,640
my phone number I don't I don't trust

951
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,920
you enough and it's just try it out it's

952
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,040
super hard and the same thing account uh

953
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,160
the phone the centralized band systems

954
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,599
the band Hammers If you do something bad

955
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,960
you're bad so I've had the same IP

956
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,060
address that I use for browsing the web

957
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,940
since the IP address was assigned to an

958
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,960
endpoint

959
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,960
no one else in the history of the

960
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,000
internet has ever used that IP address

961
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,560
I get Google captures all the time

962
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,900
because I don't use JavaScript and

963
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,940
anyway that's a different thing but it's

964
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,920
an example of how we are losing agency

965
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,900
because these big corporations they're

966
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,119
collude and and they do what's easier

967
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:13,320
for them

968
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,000
well they also act on a political

969
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,460
imperative as and we have

970
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,800
um we have people who get angry with

971
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,420
people who say nasty things on the

972
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,980
internet and they ask their legislators

973
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,839
to intervene and the legislators go to

974
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:26,940
the big companies and say look you need

975
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,560
to find a way of identifying these

976
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,480
people and the companies say oh the

977
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,579
phone number seems to be a very good way

978
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:34,140
of identifying people because remember

979
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,240
we're stuck in this mobile network

980
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,339
architecture where anyway the user SIM

981
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,200
card defines exactly who you are because

982
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,200
that's the architecture that we're in

983
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,020
um we're not at the end of the road yet

984
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,240
I just noticed this month that Reddit

985
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,339
the popular platform has changed age

986
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:51,920
verification rules

987
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,700
in August

988
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,180
if a post was marked uh NSFW you could

989
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,400
click yes I'm 18. now you have to log in

990
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,560
so we're not at the end of the road yet

991
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,400
it's going to get worse guys

992
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,400
I can see your gamers

993
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,920
so by the way the picture here is is uh

994
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,500
my personal take on on Google's don't be

995
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,119
evil that's that should be their new

996
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,480
slogan

997
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,780
so we are losing control

998
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,079
we had gtlds

999
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,660
right then we needed cctlds that's fine

1000
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,000
every country needs their their own

1001
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,099
Agency on the internet and the agency of

1002
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:34,140
of a country is protected of much more

1003
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,119
than agency of a individual on internet

1004
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:39,180
belief by that logic now

1005
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,040
the internet started with some neutral

1006
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,020
Cas okay to be fair it probably start

1007
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,760
with some governmental military CS in

1008
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,260
the US but it started with some

1009
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,820
relatively neutral CES certificate

1010
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,099
authorities but by that logic we

1011
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,900
therefore need also a national

1012
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,339
government Cas right let's say

1013
00:38:55,339 --> 00:38:59,099
Russia can't can't trust the cas of

1014
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:01,200
Mozilla Corporation because they are

1015
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,060
American companies so they need Russian

1016
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,119
government CA they're also corporate

1017
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,820
certificate stores now just recently I

1018
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,020
think it was um Chrome 105 when Google

1019
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,599
announced that for the benefit of the

1020
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,079
users as they always do why suspect us

1021
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,000
for the benefit of the users they will

1022
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,339
now run their own certificate store

1023
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:25,560
is their argument was simple so if a

1024
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,020
user is on an Android phone

1025
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,200
some websites work some hdps I can sort

1026
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,060
of see why it happens though that uh

1027
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,680
Google and Mozilla set up their own

1028
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,320
certificate Source

1029
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,760
because part of the discussion that at

1030
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,400
least I've been in for the past 10 years

1031
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,040
is whether on the internet we're finding

1032
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,960
increasing influence from say Bad

1033
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,380
nation-state actors and kills already

1034
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,420
mentioned a large country in the East

1035
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,160
that a lot of people at the present time

1036
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,500
take big issue with but we can imagine

1037
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,660
any number of nation states that have

1038
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,280
different political opinions from one

1039
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,160
another and this leading to

1040
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,540
diplomatic exchanges of less polite

1041
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,359
nature but so in the nature of being a

1042
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:08,760
nation state is also kind of the feeling

1043
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,060
of being in in and of yourself good

1044
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:16,200
you know and if you diverge from that uh

1045
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,800
if you diverge from that dichotomy you

1046
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,960
run into the problem of who decides what

1047
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,640
is the good policy for a particular

1048
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,579
territory at the particular time you

1049
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:28,079
know who is the arbitrator of what's

1050
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,599
good and bad

1051
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,640
Google and Mozilla they're both us-based

1052
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,560
organizations so we'd say that when they

1053
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,300
sell their certificate maybe they do it

1054
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,640
on their moral framework and a political

1055
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,460
imperative which is colored by the

1056
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,440
jurisdiction by their based

1057
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,480
is there something that in Europe we

1058
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,000
find uh acceptable A lot of the

1059
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,560
legislative initiatives that we've seen

1060
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,540
in the European Union for the past 10

1061
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,480
years are colored by the fact that some

1062
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,500
people

1063
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,200
in the EU some countries I will not

1064
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,820
mention any names but they're large and

1065
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:04,220
hexagonal uh feel that the U.S does not

1066
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,900
reflect the values that we want to

1067
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,720
necessarily embody in the internet

1068
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,640
architectures and services that we build

1069
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,020
in Europe right but the difference

1070
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,660
between let's say authoritarian regimes

1071
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,359
and and Democratic states is just the

1072
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:20,099
reason why they are doing it they're

1073
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:22,619
doing the same thing a couple couple

1074
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:24,119
days ago when I was trying to understand

1075
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,520
is Putin going to declare war on my

1076
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,240
country now and I try to open

1077
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,560
kremlin.through I couldn't because

1078
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,180
Latvian government decided it's bad for

1079
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,500
me to look at that site and it was

1080
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,880
blocked

1081
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,940
um so each of them have have their own

1082
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,980
agenda for for becoming CA or doing

1083
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:45,000
filtering or or blocking but research

1084
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,680
done

1085
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,900
um more than five years ago

1086
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,119
actually identified that even though

1087
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,960
certificate authorities in a system

1088
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,480
are quite Limited in number for example

1089
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,540
here we have Android it has

1090
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,640
around 200 certificate authorities and

1091
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,900
some of them are governmental directly

1092
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,980
but we have this cool thing in Cas as in

1093
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,060
in PKA as delegated trust so basically

1094
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,220
most Cas can actually say okay you're

1095
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,099
going to be USA as well and

1096
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,780
there is a cool research paper you

1097
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,920
should you should check this one out and

1098
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,140
some more on on the topic so it was

1099
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,599
found I believe that

1100
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,640
some really strange really really shady

1101
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,020
country

1102
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,599
um postal offices where Cas some some

1103
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:33,000
military agencies some universities were

1104
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,359
CA is like ca that could literally sign

1105
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:39,060
google.com at the time these days it's

1106
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,220
fixed in a way that you know there's a

1107
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,700
certificate transparency uh there's

1108
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,900
public keypinning if you believe in that

1109
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,380
so there are different things you can do

1110
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,480
so what careless actually means to say

1111
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,820
is that

1112
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:57,480
he agrees that nation states should not

1113
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,119
run their own Ci's

1114
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,880
yeah and I would argue that this is one

1115
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,500
of the beneficial parts of the internet

1116
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,599
the way that it used to be nation states

1117
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:08,280
simply had less influence and we had

1118
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,920
less territorial

1119
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,140
territorial marks on what moral values

1120
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,180
existed there

1121
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,859
um this is what I call my own

1122
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:20,280
post-modernist Paradigm of the internet

1123
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,260
rather than believing that the internet

1124
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,079
necessarily needs to embody any

1125
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,060
particular version of history that goes

1126
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,280
in a particular direction having an

1127
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,359
endpoint the moral values that are the

1128
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,220
best the internet used to be a place

1129
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,540
where you could have all sorts of people

1130
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,940
making all sorts of arguments and

1131
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,800
forming their own communities in the way

1132
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,400
that they saw the saw fit

1133
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,200
it's basically a large chaos leading to

1134
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,240
nowhere in particular and that was also

1135
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,880
the great thing the internet you could

1136
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,380
argue also the web

1137
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,440
actually wasn't ever really economically

1138
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,780
beneficial if you compare the impact of

1139
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,000
internet technology Technologies and

1140
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,319
computers to something like the

1141
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:03,480
pharmaceutical industry it's provided

1142
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,599
very little in terms of economic use you

1143
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,940
know okay we can argue logistic chains

1144
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:12,180
there we have really large benefits of

1145
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,060
information Technologies but but by and

1146
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,980
large it's like a self-orch

1147
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,980
orchestrating system and the absolutely

1148
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,140
largest impact that internet and web

1149
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,240
communities have had on people is that

1150
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,980
they are able to talk

1151
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,780
that they're able to communicate that

1152
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,460
they're able to share experiences build

1153
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,160
communities outside of their own own

1154
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,140
geographical boundaries

1155
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,319
the internet is essentially a

1156
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:39,240
post-modernist tool

1157
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,619
for peace

1158
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:42,900
which in the 1990s was also how the

1159
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,819
internet was largely sold

1160
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:47,160
there used to be these big European

1161
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,859
events and in Sweden also in the US

1162
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:51,300
where they would have small children

1163
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,339
come on stage get an ice cream talk

1164
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:55,440
about how in the future everyone was

1165
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,060
going to be friends we were at the end

1166
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,760
of history and it was just one big

1167
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,940
spiral down to Universal Harmony from

1168
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,119
here

1169
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:09,180
and we need to get back to that place

1170
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,359
and we have some challenges to the

1171
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:15,300
existing incumbents incumbents Bitcoin

1172
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,280
is challenging the banking system we can

1173
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,839
argue at what level of success they're

1174
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:22,940
doing so but they've tried

1175
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,660
Mastodon is a challenging Twitter

1176
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,000
by trying to provide a decentralized

1177
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,119
platform for short messages instead of

1178
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,800
having one centralized server

1179
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,260
we also have open source software

1180
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,540
Challengers to slack which was in itself

1181
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,960
a challenge to email

1182
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,940
and it's not only on technical level if

1183
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,680
we take a look at at the societal level

1184
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,920
you can see BitTorrent as a challenger

1185
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,480
to the incumbent in the media

1186
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,440
distribution industry

1187
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,480
now

1188
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,339
what's more important these days than

1189
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:04,859
social networks you wouldn't believe but

1190
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:07,859
it's actually email it's still by some

1191
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:10,140
metrics more popular than social

1192
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,740
networks

1193
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,400
and

1194
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,079
the problem

1195
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,940
with email

1196
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,640
is that it's getting killed and it's not

1197
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,140
it's not getting killed in a similar

1198
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,960
manner as as we've seen some other

1199
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,540
technology skills there is no uh well at

1200
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,980
least I'd like to believe that there is

1201
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,400
no grand scheme to to make email

1202
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,980
unworkable but work in a big company now

1203
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,660
and I would not say that email is dead

1204
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,880
but the big companies

1205
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,099
actually want the benefit from the email

1206
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,560
not being workable because they want it

1207
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,619
easier for themselves now back in the

1208
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:49,020
day when I started uh when I when I

1209
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,880
started with a server and a router that

1210
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,540
was

1211
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,880
routing my slash 29 Subnet in my bedroom

1212
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,579
uh that was when I started self-hosting

1213
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:59,339
my email server curls.com it's been 20

1214
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:02,640
years I've been I'm still hosting my

1215
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,400
email on a physical server I have

1216
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,920
self-host demo for 20 years but

1217
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,800
it was easy back then these days it's

1218
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,160
it's it's hard I I don't even subscribe

1219
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,960
personally to some of the

1220
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,720
new proper security technologies that

1221
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,680
have been applied to email which you

1222
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,119
should use like the main Keys is a good

1223
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,740
technology I just don't bother with it

1224
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,180
but

1225
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,940
I've read that some other people in my

1226
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,960
position

1227
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,880
that have been self-hosting email for 15

1228
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,160
20 years have given up

1229
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,020
because they do subscribe to everything

1230
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:37,740
they do domain keys they do SPF they do

1231
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,920
the reverse PTR records everything and

1232
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,680
if they just don't get delivered because

1233
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,599
it's easier for the big corporations

1234
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,240
just to filter out all the small

1235
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,640
unofficial email providers and and just

1236
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,760
deal with the big ones processing spam

1237
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,220
is expensive

1238
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,560
even though for example Google have

1239
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,780
gotten really good at filtering out

1240
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,619
email

1241
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:04,260
you can't imagine how many spam emails

1242
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,020
per second arrive at Google servers and

1243
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,760
most of those don't end up in your spam

1244
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,099
folder they just get Shadow band

1245
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:13,020
and maybe the even worse part is that

1246
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,640
the big companies get plus points from

1247
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,500
legislators doing this because they can

1248
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,180
then say oh we're benefiting user

1249
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,619
security

1250
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:21,900
and to prove that

1251
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,940
um here's a screenshot right this is the

1252
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,240
thing CSA so basically what they say is

1253
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:31,380
well uh you get our certification and uh

1254
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,180
you're gonna get deliverability

1255
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,500
advantages

1256
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,500
so what the hell is that we have a SMTP

1257
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,359
protocol it's been there for

1258
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,579
I think it was invented right after

1259
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:44,700
arpanet I believe uh and it works it's

1260
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,859
great it's like sending a postcard you

1261
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:48,780
can write whoever you want it came from

1262
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,660
you can see the content of it if even if

1263
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,220
it's not addressed to you I love SMTP

1264
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,660
it's such a great tool when I teach

1265
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,839
security courses uh but seriously though

1266
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,880
it's really sad and also fake headers

1267
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,460
yes you can of course fake headers right

1268
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,339
um seriously though I feel like it's

1269
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:06,839
through the email is dying luckily for

1270
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:09,060
me I'm I'm okay so far both my personal

1271
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,859
email and my company email which which

1272
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:13,079
we also self-host uh are getting

1273
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:14,640
delivered more or less the only problem

1274
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,099
is Gmail but we managed to migrate lots

1275
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:18,480
of customers away from Gmail by saying

1276
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,940
they don't know how to filter spam

1277
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,440
so

1278
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,319
that's one way to go at it

1279
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:26,700
now what

1280
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,598
yeah now what

1281
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,440
um well one of the drawbacks of the

1282
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,660
democratic system is that legislators

1283
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,819
aren't really appreciated for doing

1284
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:36,960
nothing

1285
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,140
so that's probably not going to be an

1286
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,379
option

1287
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,660
so what's the real thing what is the

1288
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,540
realistic Direction then

1289
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,000
well I think and this is partially based

1290
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,980
on my own personal experience from the

1291
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,200
lockdown periods which I spent uh

1292
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,300
finding this large demographic or

1293
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,040
actually interacting with a lot of these

1294
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,480
people that started using the internet

1295
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,900
after 2012. I think we need better media

1296
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,480
literacy I've discovered that there's an

1297
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,160
entire segment of the population that

1298
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,460
has smartphones with Android

1299
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,619
and an internet connection but they

1300
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:15,119
don't Google

1301
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,040
there's the search bar is right there at

1302
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,359
the bottom of their screen every day

1303
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:19,740
when they use the internet but the only

1304
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,359
thing they use the device for is taking

1305
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,280
pictures and sending it to their friends

1306
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,859
absolutely remarkable how can we get I

1307
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:28,200
mean I've spent what 10 years of my life

1308
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,819
trying to get people to use privacy

1309
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:32,520
preserving Google like alternatives to

1310
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,260
Google and then there's all of these

1311
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,900
people that they don't even

1312
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,119
use Google to begin with so media

1313
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,339
literacy for sure like

1314
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:43,859
that's something we need better

1315
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:45,359
regulation I think we need better

1316
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,579
regulation even though

1317
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:50,040
um I'm generally pessimistic about the

1318
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,839
direction that European legislators have

1319
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,420
set out I also don't think that it's

1320
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,319
feasible or uh even good not to have any

1321
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,359
regulation at all well I'm still an

1322
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,160
optimist and I think we can still try to

1323
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,740
self-regulate we don't want EU or the

1324
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,839
world World Trade Organization coming in

1325
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:09,839
and fixing our email for us

1326
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,119
no but they can regulate the behavior of

1327
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:13,980
large entities hopefully in the

1328
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,319
direction that smaller entities are

1329
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,059
giving a more fair chance at entering

1330
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:19,920
the market and staying there or

1331
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,200
providing non-commercial Services if

1332
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,359
that's their that's their desire you

1333
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:26,359
just need to have that public commitment

1334
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:28,980
and the social view about the internet

1335
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:31,079
could or should be I think that's a

1336
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:33,660
really important part we are lacking the

1337
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:36,240
majority not not in the government not

1338
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,579
in the corporations in the society

1339
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:40,680
lots of people really don't don't care

1340
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,740
about that that much so we can look at

1341
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,780
some Technical Solutions here

1342
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,839
um

1343
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:52,079
but that was only work if we do get the

1344
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,599
public commitment

1345
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:58,079
Federated social networks fediverse

1346
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,380
it's a really cool tool unfortunately

1347
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,079
it's not working too well because of the

1348
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,540
incumbent Advantage already held by

1349
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,760
large Commercial Services like Twitter

1350
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,619
and Facebook

1351
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:12,420
part of the reason for which I think is

1352
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,240
again that me and kids for instance we

1353
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,920
started using the internet when it was

1354
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,619
mostly text based and so with the

1355
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:21,240
Commercial Services we're really able to

1356
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,480
exploit uh was that people liked

1357
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,980
pictures

1358
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,140
and then Federated social networks they

1359
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,900
haven't been able to retake that I mean

1360
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,300
I feel it's a great concept actually and

1361
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,160
the real problem is right the existing

1362
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,540
networks are not Federated that's the

1363
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,000
only problem but Twitter has a separate

1364
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,640
uh just under sea level board that deals

1365
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,140
with Federation they actually are

1366
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,819
proactively looking into that nothing

1367
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:46,380
has happened yet but I'm keeping my

1368
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,920
fingers crossed

1369
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,319
ipfs interplanetary file system now this

1370
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,660
is a quite quite quite a small thing but

1371
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,640
it's a profound thing I believe it it

1372
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,579
changed the way we can actually store

1373
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:02,040
data and we can reference data so we

1374
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,020
don't need DNS we don't need third

1375
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,599
parties it's like uh Bitcoin for file

1376
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:08,220
storage

1377
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,380
or the good part of Bitcoin for file

1378
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,559
storage

1379
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,020
now then they're solid

1380
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,079
the interesting part about solid is that

1381
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:21,599
solid was created by Tim the same team

1382
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,000
that created the world wide web so it

1383
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,040
was created just a couple years ago we

1384
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,680
are still to see what solid will

1385
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,319
actually bring to the web and if it will

1386
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:34,460
be able to fix it

1387
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,040
so on a final note when we had fewer

1388
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,920
content and security laws

1389
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,300
and perhaps tragically if you were

1390
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,880
national interests defended we also had

1391
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,800
people choosing to use services that

1392
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,240
allowed them to contribute or make

1393
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,859
changes to all parts of the technical

1394
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,480
infrastructure

1395
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,880
there were two way streets not just

1396
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,220
influencers and pictures

1397
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,319
and now that we're in this new era of

1398
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,819
idols

1399
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:03,059
and centralization moving forward is not

1400
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:05,040
just this easy as developing a new

1401
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,380
technical protocol we have a few ideas

1402
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,859
in kiril's presented but it's not going

1403
00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:12,660
to be enough we need the social aspect

1404
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,460
and we need the media literacy part as

1405
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,800
well

1406
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,359
we need to build new social norms we

1407
00:54:18,359 --> 00:54:20,099
need to gather the masses behind us and

1408
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:21,440
we need to get

1409
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,300
politicians that buy into this vision of

1410
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,339
the internet as a bridge between

1411
00:54:26,339 --> 00:54:29,240
communities for people for them to make

1412
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,819
the organization and technologies that

1413
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:34,440
they want

1414
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,420
and part of that work must be a public

1415
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,640
commitment seeing the internet or the

1416
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,140
web for the social tool that it is

1417
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:55,140
[Applause]

1418
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,880
so I'm not sure if we have time for

1419
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,440
questions or if there's anything to ask

1420
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,300
five minutes great here's a question

1421
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,839
Mike then

1422
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,079
uh first of all thank you for your nice

1423
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,440
presentation and uh I wanted to ask you

1424
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,020
don't you maybe feel you mentioned how

1425
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,000
in the old days of the internet when we

1426
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,220
were all on in the ircs and stuff like

1427
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,500
that like communities were different

1428
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,079
than there globally now and totally

1429
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:32,940
agree but don't you think they're also

1430
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,059
now uh happening sub communities inside

1431
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:38,220
all of those places that are super

1432
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,260
popular like private Facebook groups

1433
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:43,859
like groups IO and I don't know Discord

1434
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:46,859
channels that actually have the same

1435
00:55:46,859 --> 00:55:50,520
like Community vibe that old groups had

1436
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,420
and they of course by definitions aren't

1437
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:56,520
uh Global and like approachable to

1438
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,680
everybody except for those people who

1439
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,020
actually want to be there and I don't

1440
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,900
feel they're also monitored or moderated

1441
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,119
more than the old groups were by the

1442
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:08,280
local admins or such so don't you think

1443
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,680
maybe the communities actually finding a

1444
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,460
way to to to to I don't know EX Express

1445
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:18,059
itself in some other ways

1446
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:19,800
I have a different answer each of us to

1447
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,319
to to every question here so my take on

1448
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,020
that is that first of all they are

1449
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,559
really heavily moderated uh Facebook

1450
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:30,480
records every message that you send

1451
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,160
before you send it even if you delete it

1452
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,500
before sending it also applies to to

1453
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,720
community groups and and they look at

1454
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,940
the content and they intervene uh when

1455
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:41,099
they feel necessary a second point that

1456
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:43,500
I'd like to make is Facebook is not for

1457
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,079
everybody I've tried

1458
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,180
when when connecting with new Social

1459
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,400
Circles I've tried to create a Facebook

1460
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,220
account with a fake name of course it

1461
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,859
gets deleted in one week

1462
00:56:54,859 --> 00:56:57,540
and for the group itself I feel

1463
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,859
personally for me that's the biggest

1464
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:02,099
risk uh I don't feel that I can trust

1465
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:03,780
Facebook or Google or any large

1466
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,839
corporation not to delete my stuff if

1467
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:08,640
something something happens we've had

1468
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,900
this case recently uh where um a couple

1469
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,540
um my man and wife I think

1470
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:19,280
um we are exchanging uh pictures of the

1471
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,599
genitals of their son because it was

1472
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,599
covered and they had to forward it to

1473
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:25,980
the doctor because there was an

1474
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,200
infection or something and the guys

1475
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,119
Google account got got locked and

1476
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:31,740
deleted

1477
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,440
so I think the uh yeah

1478
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,380
um my uh my take on that would be

1479
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,000
broadly similar the weakness of Facebook

1480
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,559
is that it's just the one entity and

1481
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:41,940
it's very difficult to make it more than

1482
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,220
one they're under one jurisdiction but

1483
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,720
they're also an easy target for anyone

1484
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,720
that wants to impose moderation

1485
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,960
um moderation requirements on them and

1486
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,640
so whenever you do anything that goes

1487
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,680
out of uh what is the moderated

1488
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,960
requirement you're basically vulnerable

1489
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,940
and it's true that you can find some

1490
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:03,119
examples of of uh when Facebook has been

1491
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,859
used for dissident activities you would

1492
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:07,260
say say the northern African political

1493
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,260
riots that happened back in 2010 2011.

1494
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:12,059
Facebook was an extremely important

1495
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:14,099
platform for people to get videos out of

1496
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:15,540
when they were getting beaten up by the

1497
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,319
police

1498
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,240
But ultimately that was also because

1499
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,400
somebody over the U.S decided that it

1500
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,079
was politically opportune for them at

1501
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,900
the time to have political unrest in

1502
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,960
that region of the world and so uh it's

1503
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,980
kind of

1504
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:31,859
double-edged sword Facebook I think we

1505
00:58:31,859 --> 00:58:34,619
are provided with greater flexibility to

1506
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:35,420
um

1507
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,099
to empower ourselves if we have a more

1508
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,200
decentralized way of building

1509
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,059
infrastructures that we communicate

1510
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:44,240
through

1511
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,940
thank you hi

1512
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,119
um I have a I had an issue with the

1513
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:54,420
Facebook which you mentioned uh it's a

1514
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:58,559
rather rare one I think uh once I I

1515
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,079
don't use it I just have an account to

1516
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:07,619
try Barely Used and once I try to log

1517
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:11,640
didn't insert a good password and then

1518
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:15,420
block me when I try to uh

1519
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:18,240
change my password they asked for a

1520
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,359
number ID number plus password number

1521
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,119
all kind of of numbers

1522
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:26,760
I refused of course because I don't need

1523
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,119
Facebook but

1524
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:33,540
if I entered my ID number how do they

1525
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,579
know if it is correct

1526
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:37,140
do they know

1527
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,460
do they have all my numbers already

1528
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,859
uh to cut a short uh

1529
00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:46,319
after by month

1530
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:51,180
when I tried to log in this

1531
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,920
input field

1532
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,020
changed and I could change my password

1533
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:59,760
without them asking for my ID numbers

1534
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,299
so it's to me it's rather rare

1535
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:06,119
yeah I I can only commend you or your

1536
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:08,520
committal to uh to keeping your privacy

1537
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:12,599
I had I had absolutely the uh same

1538
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:15,059
experience and personally I feel like at

1539
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:16,799
least in the EU and maybe even the whole

1540
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:18,900
world with time government will regulate

1541
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,660
this platforms enough that that they

1542
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,339
cannot just arbitrarily delete or block

1543
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:25,920
but I I'm afraid that the way they're

1544
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,359
gonna solve it is this they're going to

1545
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:28,920
ask for ID and I also don't feel

1546
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,280
comfortable with that uh at all not not

1547
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,200
at the slightest

1548
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,700
I mean there's also the separate

1549
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,500
separate thing that could happen which

1550
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,420
is that the cool kids nowadays don't use

1551
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,819
Facebook I don't think

1552
01:00:41,819 --> 01:00:43,440
like the youngsters they're on Snapchat

1553
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,859
I've seen it it's not better well same

1554
01:00:46,859 --> 01:00:49,700
problems huh

1555
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:54,540
also oh there's none at the back over

1556
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,779
there

1557
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,619
we're actually all the time yeah

1558
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:03,240
final question

1559
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,480
no problem so um to me what you've

1560
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,880
identified here is a problem of

1561
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,880
Economics of scale so uh decentralized

1562
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,359
Network as the interim that you know was

1563
01:01:14,359 --> 01:01:16,740
uh as it grows it becomes more

1564
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,140
centralized the duty economies of scale

1565
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,520
so

1566
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,460
to me to retake the internet you would

1567
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,299
either have to get rid of some of these

1568
01:01:26,299 --> 01:01:29,520
incentives that make it grow a certain

1569
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,859
way or you would have to

1570
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:34,680
as I believe has historically been done

1571
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,299
just build something new

1572
01:01:36,299 --> 01:01:41,160
so do you have any comments as to that

1573
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,440
I agree very many thanks for bringing

1574
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,200
that point it is definitely true that

1575
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,780
this is an economic problem and a social

1576
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,579
problem and that we currently have

1577
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:53,220
politicians and Regulatory Frameworks in

1578
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,380
the world not just locally but also

1579
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,240
regionally in Europe and globally

1580
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,220
through the World Trade Organization but

1581
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:01,799
also otherwise that benefits the

1582
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:03,540
centralized the rise of centralized

1583
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:04,920
Services more than they benefit the

1584
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,040
decentralized services and this is why I

1585
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,720
feel very strongly that we need this

1586
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,640
social and public commitment to having

1587
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,559
an economic model that works differently

1588
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:16,680
that allows us to benefit from these

1589
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,799
communication Technologies in a way that

1590
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:22,380
I think lies closer to what people's

1591
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,059
actual preferences for the use of the

1592
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:26,460
Technologies are but also in just the

1593
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,220
way that is better for mankind let's say

1594
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:34,619
to add to that so for me even if even if

1595
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:36,480
let's say Facebook is still the largest

1596
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,760
social network is being Federated means

1597
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,760
that I can connect to it from my own

1598
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,440
server and other people can do that and

1599
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,420
I I wouldn't mind in that case that it's

1600
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,160
it's where it's centralized and it's

1601
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,040
that's where the majority of users are

1602
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,960
so I think that way we could at least

1603
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,599
buy ourselves some time until the same

1604
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:56,819
thing that happened the email also

1605
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:58,559
happens to this system

1606
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,480
we could hope perhaps also that the

1607
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,819
advertisement Market crashes I've been

1608
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:04,440
secretly uh

1609
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,960
secretly waiting for this moment I think

1610
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,680
there's like yeah

1611
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,280
thank you so much for your questions and

1612
