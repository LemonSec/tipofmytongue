they're doing a lot of a lot of

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,899
interesting stuff

17
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,719
in that Hobby and today we are going to

18
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,280
try to make it a little bit closer to

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,100
you maybe some of you I know that we're

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,619
involved in a hobby maybe back in the

21
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,860
day 20 30 years ago or I don't know half

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,159
a Century Two centuries

23
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,740
but maybe there are some young people

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,500
who never actually heard about the hobby

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,259
who never actually thought what that is

26
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,780
and in in the you know

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,540
in this time of mass communication and

28
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,740
internet the usual thing is they ask why

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,780
why do you need you know radio station

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,420
when you have a mobile phone and except

31
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,759
you know when Godzilla Stars start to

32
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,460
you know run for you and he Stomps all

33
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,619
of the you know landlines what we're

34
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,380
going to use and who are going to call

35
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,240
I'm at the radio operators of course

36
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,299
welcome welcome young people

37
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,180
yeah yeah you're now like everybody just

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,220
look at them they're late

39
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,340
yeah and

40
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:06,299
um

41
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,660
the harmony radio hobby is not something

42
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,800
that utilizes or gives you any I mean

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,840
couple of superpowers yes but no not

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,120
nothing material or or something like

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,080
that and I I usually say like your

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,940
better positioned than you know

47
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,120
Freemasons Whenever Wherever I went

48
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
there is there is one you know radio

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,040
operator there he's devil series he's

50
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,580
his administrator or his ACO or that

51
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,400
startup and so on so yeah there are a

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,280
lot of us the hobby is not dead it is

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,599
transforming

54
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,200
so it is embracing uh new new

55
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,360
technologies it is actually leading a

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,379
couple of uh those because uh amateur

57
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,900
radio Enthusiast enthusiasts are

58
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,319
actually trying to experiment and

59
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:00,120
determine the limits of the wireless

60
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,760
technology mainly but also everything

61
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,000
connected to electronics and in general

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,819
everything that should interest

63
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:12,140
intelligent people but today's

64
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,300
I hate this like how do politicians do

65
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,599
this like you you go like 10 centimeters

66
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,140
do I have to look ominous all right um

67
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,238
so I'm staring

68
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,300
today uh the plan was to have a short

69
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,239
presentation just to let you know what

70
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,780
is fox hunting in context of amateur

71
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,920
radio

72
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
and then idea is uh

73
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,679
if somebody wants to is this raining

74
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,780
okay okay that's yeah that's that's much

75
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,900
better because the idea was to go after

76
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,040
this short intro to go into backyard

77
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,540
that we have we have a very nice

78
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,959
backyard it is really Spacey I I don't

79
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,680
suppose you you walked many of you uh

80
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,620
through there that in that direction in

81
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,959
previous Balkans but today there is a

82
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,379
reason to do so so we are going to plant

83
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,599
um hidden Fox and we're going to teach

84
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,320
you know anyone who wants to try to find

85
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,959
it without you know using their senses

86
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,639
other than ears

87
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,220
and um yeah that that would be a

88
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,320
practical thing one additional thing

89
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,540
that I

90
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,960
kind of prepared for today but you know

91
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,580
you're going to be a better testers with

92
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,860
me and the rest of the members of the

93
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,780
amateur radio club is actually Adventure

94
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,720
game connected to those

95
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,620
um hidden so to say artifacts or

96
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,900
stations and each of them unlocks a part

97
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,720
of the adventure story so that that's

98
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,840
the idea you know the realization

99
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,440
I mean I spent some time creating that

100
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,840
for balcon it is not fully finished but

101
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,440
you can get the idea how it looks like

102
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,000
um anyhow let's continue so hunting

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,520
electronic foxes I mean that that's a

104
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,020
general idea we're going to talk a

105
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,199
little bit about Theory not too much we

106
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,479
have a lot of like um we're doing this

107
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,300
with very young young children because

108
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,880
it's it's not that complicated to

109
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,639
explain the basics and to try out the

110
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,479
basics

111
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,560
it's actually fun we usually go with

112
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,820
them on a football field or something

113
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,639
like that and we tie their eyes and then

114
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,800
we teach them how to find without

115
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,860
looking that hidden station and that's

116
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,160
usually it goes well they they like it

117
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,300
and it is fun actually so I was thinking

118
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,240
about how can we make it maybe a step

119
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,860
further and

120
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,620
this is where this game actually comes

121
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,539
in but we're going to talk to the about

122
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,500
that in details later on

123
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,199
but what is you know electronic foxes

124
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,620
and fox Hunter how we call it

125
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,320
amateur radio goniometry it's like I

126
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,180
don't know if if this English term but

127
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,720
you know in Syrian it's called like that

128
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,020
um basically it it consists of trying to

129
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,020
find by different rules of course trying

130
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,180
to find hidden um

131
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,500
radio stations by just using a receiver

132
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,780
much like this

133
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,039
so

134
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,720
there are a couple models of course you

135
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,660
can build it yourself of course we have

136
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,180
this which is you know quite standard

137
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,020
looking you have a antenna up here uh

138
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,300
connector for headphones so you can hear

139
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,699
the signal from the healing station and

140
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,280
couple of potentiometers that you know

141
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,400
help you tune and and

142
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,180
um

143
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,720
set the volume of the headphones as well

144
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,479
so this one or it can look like

145
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,080
like this thing like post apocalyptic

146
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,060
gun for

147
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,759
really hunting the electronic foxes

148
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,060
so but but the basics are the same and

149
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,400
we're going to cover that later on in

150
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,380
details how how do you

151
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,740
actually go and how do you find it

152
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,520
um

153
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,720
let me just switch another so

154
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,460
um

155
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,000
you uh probably heard about

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,020
um volunteering that's a pretty not

157
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,539
pretty I'm old so it's it's relatively

158
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,340
new

159
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,240
um sport so to say or entering you get I

160
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,699
don't know if anybody of you tried that

161
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,300
I tried once and it's right somehow but

162
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,660
you receive a map of a certain area

163
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,660
it's a topographic map very little one

164
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,380
uh it's usually a large section so you

165
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,800
need to run you're timed and you have

166
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,680
your checkpoints you know drawn on the

167
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,940
map and just using the compass and your

168
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,580
knowledge of you know Maps you need to

169
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,500
run in as fast as possible you need to

170
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,599
find it looks something like this in the

171
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,479
end you know

172
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,360
when you find the location of the for

173
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,720
for your orienteering looks similar to

174
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,639
this this is for a fox hunt but for

175
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,020
volunteering you have the same thing

176
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,719
something like that and you have NFC

177
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,659
like ring or something like that and you

178
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,580
just checking that you that you find it

179
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,940
and they time your um your minutes spent

180
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,860
to find the station in another station

181
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,740
the location and they you know tag you

182
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,580
so this is actually a sport that was

183
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,640
um so to say created from fox hunting

184
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,620
because because amateur fox hunting is

185
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,580
older

186
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,019
so we were first yes no not those guys

187
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:04,459
uh so there are some things

188
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:08,220
that you can determine by using this uh

189
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,620
receiving station like you can determine

190
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,899
when when you turn left and right and

191
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,940
around you can determine where the

192
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,060
signal is the strongest so you know that

193
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,880
because those are a kind of directional

194
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,920
antennas they are not actually I mean

195
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,600
you can build a directional antenna and

196
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,279
the receiver is better if you have the

197
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,680
directional one and for Trans servers as

198
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,980
well but even if this dipole it is a

199
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,440
kind of like you have minimum a maximum

200
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,339
at certain point it really going to to

201
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,800
do boring stuff but you know the

202
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,580
um

203
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,680
diagram of

204
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,500
um what's called the radiation diagram

205
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,279
for that antenna is like drawing a kind

206
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,360
of that symbol of eight or you know

207
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,320
Infinity which is you know fitting so um

208
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,899
you have actually when you when you go

209
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,380
and scan manually the area you will hear

210
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,620
the signal the strongest at one

211
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,839
Direction but you don't know if the

212
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,660
station is in front of you or behind you

213
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,420
so you then have to do a couple of other

214
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,360
operations to determine if the station

215
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,120
is in front or behind you

216
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,720
and then excuse me

217
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,580
and then

218
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,959
when you have map and you you draw the

219
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,580
line you know where you are you know

220
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,779
where the

221
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,940
supposedly line of the transmission is

222
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,459
and then you go to another location you

223
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:45,480
move maybe 550 meters or 100 meters and

224
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,000
then you crisscross those lines that you

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,140
get and uh in ideal case you would get a

226
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,600
location of the station like that but in

227
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,820
reality you probably need couple of more

228
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,320
points to to get a better location

229
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,380
quality so this is how you do it in in

230
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,380
you know in short

231
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,779
steps

232
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:13,260
so uh yes as it's seen uh score is

233
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,579
calculated based on number of

234
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:18,720
transmitters that you found and also the

235
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,839
time that it took you to find it so the

236
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,279
faster you do it

237
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,459
the better it is uh I'm here talking

238
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,519
about the just there is competitions

239
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,100
there are competitions of course but it

240
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,860
it is also a fun activity and not

241
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,019
everybody should be competing anyhow

242
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,540
because that is not fun believe me

243
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,300
but you can organize the fun activity

244
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,839
and in North America they all they have

245
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,060
something which we don't have of course

246
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,060
it is connected to cars because you know

247
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,899
cars and they're trying to find

248
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,420
um hidden stations by using cars

249
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,320
probably jacks or what no but Ford or

250
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,040
some big ass pickup trucks and later on

251
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,380
they go and burn some tires of course in

252
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,279
the process but the the idea is the same

253
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,920
so there is a hidden station you need to

254
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,980
find it as quick as possible or to find

255
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,320
the quickest route to the station by

256
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,320
driving your car and then you win and

257
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,040
that can be fun really there is also a

258
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,660
couple of other options that you can do

259
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,380
the fox hunting and one of them is like

260
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,940
you're not actually moving but you're

261
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,160
having a team of your mates

262
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,260
um like similarly crazy to your you know

263
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,920
craziness and they all have stations and

264
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,300
they have their location and they listen

265
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,880
from their location where the station is

266
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,339
and they try to figure out where the

267
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,980
station is without going there without

268
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,800
actually going to verify the station is

269
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,600
there and they send the location to

270
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,060
organizers the closest one to predict

271
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,839
where the station is means so you can do

272
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,779
it by foot you can do it by car or you

273
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,300
know motor vehicle or whatever or you

274
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,600
can do it like this and but the

275
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,060
principle is similar so the the whole

276
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,620
point is to find something which is

277
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,380
hidden which cannot be seen by anything

278
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,339
else by but the radio receiver and to do

279
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,160
it as fast as you can so no need for

280
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,180
competition it's always fun to try and

281
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,200
we are going to try it later on so yeah

282
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,040
there's a you know a common brief

283
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,360
history of fox hunting soon we had like

284
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,680
goniometer first created in 1907.

285
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,860
so it had directional antenna bearing

286
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,040
and you know if you maybe I I know that

287
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,620
some of you created yeah yeah looking at

288
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,279
you so created the pirate radius so yeah

289
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,060
I I'm actually you know envious I wanted

290
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,260
to do that

291
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,480
so if they want to hunt you they're

292
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,500
going to use the same technique but just

293
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,720
probably a bit different

294
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,779
um

295
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,459
um equipment so maybe a little bit more

296
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,100
serious police or military equipment so

297
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,180
it is still used if you have some uh

298
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,639
station that you need to find and also I

299
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,760
don't know if you know there is um

300
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,279
obligatory in airplanes like you have uh

301
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,339
what is called non-directional beacons

302
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:37,980
which they listen and then if all other

303
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,300
sources of navigations fail uh your

304
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,760
trust tip pilot probably not of the

305
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,940
Boeing or some big passenger jet but you

306
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,300
know if you're in a small airplane that

307
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,760
you know have propeller or from the

308
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,820
second world war and you're lost in the

309
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,519
fog or whatever and your instrument is

310
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,620
not working correctly you can always

311
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,320
rely on those ndbs non-directional

312
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,639
beacons and this kind of thing to figure

313
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,160
out where the stations are you know

314
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,320
where the map where they should be you

315
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,079
have the map of them you have all of the

316
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,899
location you know what they type and

317
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,639
yeah that's another thing all of those

318
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,160
stations that are hidden uh actually are

319
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,079
transmitting something what do they

320
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,600
transmit well usually they transmit to

321
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,620
Morse code

322
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,920
because moscows is cool and it's simple

323
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,440
to implement because it's uh just a

324
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,940
binary there is a signal there is no

325
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,820
signal you can do more with whatever

326
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,180
continues uh signal that you just break

327
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,500
or specific intervals of Silence so that

328
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,600
is why it is called a continuous wave or

329
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,740
CW in amateur radio as well

330
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,079
so this technology is actually still

331
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,240
being used and it's going to be used in

332
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,860
a foreseeable future

333
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,699
so um this is just the intro so it can

334
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,820
be one of the ways into the Armature

335
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,579
radio hobby there are many other phase

336
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:12,000
facets of that hobby as well so you can

337
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,079
do uh you know standard operator uh work

338
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,720
which you can see I mean we're going to

339
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,480
do some qso some connections on the

340
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,079
station just next to that gaming machine

341
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:28,500
at the entry and or you can construct

342
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,139
things or you know there are a lot of

343
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,760
things we had a presentation yesterday

344
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,839
about the meteorological songs so guys

345
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,060
are hunting them as well so that's very

346
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,980
interesting and you know very fun

347
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,560
activity if you want to be you know

348
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,740
Frozen in the winter or if you if you

349
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,560
like being in a mud and you know not

350
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,420
finding the sound in the end but yeah

351
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,519
it's fun

352
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,920
or you can you can use satellites we

353
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,199
have colleagues which are specialized in

354
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,019
Satellite Satellite Communication for

355
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,839
amateur radio or all sorts of things you

356
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,000
know so it's it's not as simple like

357
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,459
yeah I just sit at the station and you

358
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,059
know do connections

359
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:14,939
so back to the to the history

360
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,839
oh 20 minutes already okay I thought it

361
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,059
it was nearing to end you know it's for

362
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:22,319
me it's like yeah

363
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,439
uh just kidding so

364
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,599
um in Europe they started as a school

365
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,020
activity 1950s uh back in the day

366
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,320
amateur radio was much more included in

367
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,980
um

368
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,380
so to say school activities is all

369
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,900
around the world it was also in Serbia

370
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,059
it was connected it was incorporated in

371
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:46,820
a defense department in a sense

372
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,380
so the first European championship in

373
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,240
rdf was held in 1961. and we have um

374
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,700
amateur radio Union that standardized

375
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,960
rules in 1993

376
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,700
we have a game set in 2004 competing 400

377
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,740
athletes from 29 countries and four

378
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,940
continents

379
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,460
so

380
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,020
there are a lot of activity there there

381
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,100
and it is also one of the few activities

382
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,140
of amateur radio that you actually have

383
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,020
to move your butt so yeah that's that's

384
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,720
a plus side obviously I'm not doing that

385
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,660
enough but I'm going to start from

386
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,539
Monday

387
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:33,179
so how does it work so the traditional

388
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:37,400
rdf is the oh sorry

389
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,900
if I die if I die just remember me

390
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,400
by this presentation or not okay so the

391
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,980
transmitters are set to transmit on one

392
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,820
minute each so if you have you typically

393
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,679
have a five transmitters transmitting

394
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,520
Morse code you see here something that

395
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,860
does not seem logical the first sight uh

396
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,600
m o e m o i m o s m o h and mo5 but why

397
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,919
is that because when it is typed in

398
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,600
Morse code the end letters e i s h and

399
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,280
five are actually sequence of

400
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,559
they call it the dits so it's like did

401
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,559
did it did

402
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,559
and so and so on so up to five so you

403
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,900
can actually count the dits and you know

404
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,280
what station are you hearing so uh of

405
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,340
course it's typing very slow so even if

406
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,740
you don't know the morse code you can

407
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,400
you know just by using your super

408
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,220
hearing and you can identify the the

409
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,640
letters and the foxes that we prepared

410
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,160
for today are just typing without ammo

411
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,320
just typing e i s h and five so just the

412
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,580
dots like one two five

413
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,220
so as we said we need to find the

414
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,840
transmitters by taking directional

415
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,320
bearings so we go and scan the area

416
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,500
and observe the signal strength so we

417
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,679
are searching for the flag as I said by

418
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,480
comparing all the directions that we get

419
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,280
uh

420
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,340
drawing them on the map and then trying

421
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,500
to actually find on the map what we

422
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,419
think the location of the station is

423
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:31,460
it's not that simple because as

424
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,520
my trusty fellow onto the radial

425
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,120
operators now there are different bands

426
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,460
that behave quite differently so if you

427
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,760
have two meters it's uh different from I

428
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,600
mean if you have 144 megahertz or 433

429
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,940
megahertz it behaves that the wave

430
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,820
behaves differently and why I said like

431
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,620
two meters because the length wavelength

432
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,100
of that frequencies to meters it really

433
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,960
behaves differently than

434
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,960
um for example 40 or 20 meters so

435
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,059
14 megahertz or 80 or 3 3 and a half

436
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,400
megahertz

437
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,980
that two meter wave is actually like

438
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,460
like a laser it really can bounce of

439
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,840
stuff and you can imagine like trying to

440
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,000
listen to the station and I think it is

441
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,500
you know this is the direction of the

442
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,140
station but actually not so actually it

443
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,740
can be uh bouncing out of rocks or the

444
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,240
hard surface out of water so this is all

445
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,980
um you know this is Advanced this is not

446
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,900
something that you're going to need at

447
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,419
the first step but what I'm trying to

448
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,640
say there is a gradation of the skill

449
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,159
that you can build I mean it's easy to

450
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,440
go to schools and to present some

451
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,020
something that you can enjoy in in you

452
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,659
know in the couple of times in in the

453
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,240
summer time but in serious competitions

454
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,940
there are some serious

455
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,020
knowledge that needs to be really

456
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,960
gathered and you need to do it fast so

457
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,659
yeah

458
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,620
yeah as as uh okay let's go back uh okay

459
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,340
yeah I I already said the flag that you

460
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,980
find it has a punch card or an

461
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,760
electronic leader reader leader like

462
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,159
yeah

463
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,039
okay so electronic reader here's the

464
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:29,340
mark your scorecard so you're scored by

465
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,900
based on that

466
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:36,360
so yeah and uh the okay so we did

467
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,460
yeah this is traditional we mentioned

468
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,880
two meters like two meter wavelength so

469
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,919
we have a propagation challenge that we

470
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,460
that we talked about uh terrain really

471
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,640
UPS uh can affect the propagation of the

472
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,220
waves and it can lead you to believe

473
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,960
that the station is somewhere where it

474
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,200
is not so there is one not so fun story

475
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,620
but life-saving story from one of our uh

476
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,659
amateur radio members who was in the war

477
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:07,320
actually and he um when there was this

478
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,860
bombing of Serbia in 1999 and he

479
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,220
communicated uh with his peers by

480
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,000
bouncing the the signal out of some

481
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,539
um Hill which he knowed it was Rocky and

482
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,179
that Hill got hit like 15 minutes after

483
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:27,539
the communication ended so you know the

484
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,480
even even the big armies have problems

485
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,820
in you know having those bounces of

486
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,039
signals to determine where the actual

487
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,799
and friend or four is so it's not that

488
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:41,220
easy so the same thing goes in C

489
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,700
civilian like recreational

490
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,919
application as the fox hunting is so

491
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,440
what is good for two meter fox hunting

492
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,980
it's easy to build antennas

493
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,960
you can basically make one from a tape

494
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,260
measure I think we have like this it

495
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,120
doesn't really show but it is a tape

496
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,600
measure actually so you can

497
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,980
easily build the uh receiver for 80

498
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,200
meter fox hunting it's a bit more

499
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,020
challenging to create a receiver but you

500
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,500
know a receiver is as as it is here

501
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,419
stated it is less bulky

502
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:24,600
uh it has a sharp now so when you go off

503
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,520
the track where the transmission line is

504
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,880
you really get a very crisp loss of

505
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,039
sound

506
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,380
we have a quite different propagation so

507
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,280
it doesn't quite behave as two meter

508
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,100
maybe it's easier maybe not so for

509
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,740
example this is one of the examples for

510
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,320
the receivers something like this but

511
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,200
this guy created another kind of antenna

512
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,860
you can have uh loop antennas for

513
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,260
example so some some kind of directional

514
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,799
ones so this is those are the rules so

515
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,400
um usually uh you do it in a public park

516
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,080
if you do it internationally it's

517
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,780
usually 10 by 10 kilometers for local

518
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,840
events two by two you get the maps

519
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,299
provided uh showing all of the major

520
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,700
topographic

521
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,080
um

522
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,419
um characteristic of the of the place

523
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:22,100
that you're counting foxes

524
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,740
and this is how it looks like so you

525
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,860
would receive something like this uh we

526
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,779
would prepare I mean hopefully we'll

527
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,179
have much more detailed uh story

528
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,299
regarding the game that we are doing in

529
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:39,600
connection to this rdf I mean to my

530
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,059
knowledge it's never been done this way

531
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:44,940
so it might be I mean but it doesn't

532
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,220
mean that it is good that it wasn't done

533
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,200
before it just might mean that it's

534
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,360
stupid idea but we will not know until

535
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,000
we try so you're probably going to

536
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,080
receive a map of interior uh backyard of

537
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
balcon

538
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,960
and then the the same rule applies that

539
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,480
we are going to show you when when we go

540
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,720
outside for example we have here yeah I

541
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,779
have to stay close to those mics really

542
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:16,500
annoying to to be so stationary so this

543
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,260
is actually the the uh one of the foxes

544
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,620
that we prepared what we have inside it

545
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,620
doesn't show really it's Arduino Pro

546
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,460
Mini it's connected to a specific let me

547
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,740
I think I have one with

548
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,960
yeah

549
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,159
no

550
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,980
but anyhow so it has Arduino Pro it has

551
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,260
a transmitter for uh two and a half

552
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,140
megahertz which is using just a crystal

553
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,159
so it's not anything complex like

554
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:51,720
oscillatory you know Electronics or

555
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,000
something simple Crystal on a specified

556
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,380
frequency

557
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,580
uh and it has the RTC module so to hold

558
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,820
the time so that you know when you start

559
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,039
the stations it knows like first station

560
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,419
is going to transmit for the first

561
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:07,919
minute the second one for the second

562
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,799
minute and so on and so on so it's it's

563
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,080
simple as that so we're probably going

564
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,720
to share the code once we are not too

565
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,279
embarrassed by it so we have uh like

566
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,980
yo7aop.com and that things really needs

567
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,460
a bit more you know long and tender

568
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,760
so but yeah a plan is to when we hone

569
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,919
all of the rough edges to to share

570
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,159
everything so anybody can try

571
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,360
um I think yeah I think we can finish

572
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,419
with the I mean the whole idea is not to

573
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:45,299
have too much of the you know blah blah

574
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:48,960
and and Theory but just to go outside

575
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,919
and try it out so and uh since the game

576
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:56,220
was planned we also had like uh you know

577
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,919
symbolic prices like we have a ham radio

578
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,260
moonshine that you know my mother-in-law

579
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,679
makes so it's it's a great rakia we call

580
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:06,960
it for this event we call it uh we have

581
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,380
two names actually for uh Odin even you

582
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,200
know years of the Balkan so the last

583
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,419
time it was radioactive bet

584
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:19,020
this year it's radioactive red so yeah

585
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,039
but it's it's a good one so uh please uh

586
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,559
just feel free to join us we are going

587
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:29,400
anyhow to try out all of those stuff and

588
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,799
the application and the foxes in the in

589
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,900
the backyard of the welcome we're going

590
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,840
to be here for maybe two hours something

591
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,980
like that

592
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,760
around that so everybody is is uh free

593
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,100
and welcome to join and we can discuss

594
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,340
and you can try out to find the the

595
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,340
foxes and try out in practice how this

596
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,400
really works because all of these things

597
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,640
is just words so you that the whole idea

598
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,720
is to move you to maybe spark some a

599
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,880
little spark of interest in the topic

600
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,880
and to go and try it out because if you

601
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,980
wait like yeah I'm going to do this in

602
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,900
like yeah sure it is interesting but

603
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,880
just after I learned how to play the

604
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,400
harp for whatever oboa or something like

605
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,440
that that's on my bucket list and then

606
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,340
after that I will try rdf no just new

607
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,380
things that you discover every day just

608
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,659
try to try it out because you know

609
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:30,899
you're not going to try it for sure if

610
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:33,360
you're not right soon

611
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,179
so uh thank you I don't know if there

612
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:37,919
are some thank you for having no

613
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:38,310
questions

614
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,779
[Laughter]

615
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,059
but no no seriously if you want to ask

616
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,000
something ask bodies

617
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,799
uh just kidding ask me and I will ask

618
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,039
him if I don't know which I want so yeah

619
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:53,399
Shoot Me Not

620
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:56,760
sorry any questions

621
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,140
all right

622
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,480
okay

623
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,880
sorry

624
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,520
three five eight what's the crystal

625
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,779
frequency board is

626
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,320
3.579

627
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,840
3.579 megahertz

628
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,299
if they're going to transmit

629
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,100
you're going to see we're going to see I

630
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,740
I spent all night assembling them

631
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,320
and I hope that some of them will work

632
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,860
but you know today is the you know

633
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,360
baptism of Fire

634
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,500
yeah uh all right all right I don't know

635
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,840
how to you know understand this like no

636
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,240
questions okay but it's even better even

637
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,520
better I hope that you will join us

638
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,039
really and uh thank you for for coming

639
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,080
thank you for listening and now it's

640
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,539
time for Action if you you're welcome

641
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:51,779
let's let's join and talk you can ask

642
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:54,360
whatever you know it is not going to be

643
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,700
connected only to fox hunting whatever

644
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,059
you you want to ask us metal satellites

645
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,460
sounds

646
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,480
calligraphy or whatever you know

647
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,940
whatever Sparks your interest we are

648
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,000
here thank you

649
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,150
[Applause]
