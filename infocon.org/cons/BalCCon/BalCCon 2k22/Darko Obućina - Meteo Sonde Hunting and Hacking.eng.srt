00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:12,710
[Music]

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,130
thank you

3
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,060
[Music]

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,939
all right sorry for the delay next up we

5
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,720
have Draco obuchino with meteor Sons on

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,160
packing and hunting thank you

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,320
hi everyone my name is

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,300
member of the radio clubs

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,120
next my name this is my personal call

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,340
who is familiar and uh

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,200
this

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,340
below is a call of the radio clubs

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,739
so this this is not like the main

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,840
stuff what we are doing hunting the

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,619
metal

16
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,780
song but in the a while when we have

17
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,220
time we

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,340
for kill some time we doing this and now

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,220
I will explain what is the metal sondar

20
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,900
and uh

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,080
how you can do this is very interesting

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,740
so the radio zones you know probably you

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,680
heard for metal Balloons with helium

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,000
going up here so what is a a radio sound

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,100
so radios on the

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,140
his uh

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,939
hey you can read the base instrument

28
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,560
platform with radio transmitting

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,600
compatibilities name is radio Sound

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,840
that's like usually it's on the radio

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,340
transmitter and so on the French

32
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,159
meanings online

33
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,220
and they have a instrument

34
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,640
to gathering information of the weather

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,340
from the every single height when they

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,299
go up about they go up 40 kilometers up

37
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,540
so when you start a weather application

38
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,180
on your phone and you have a

39
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,940
data on your phone you have data

40
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,860
probably for the local station when you

41
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,959
have prediction on your phone uh

42
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,840
prediction of uh weather for the

43
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,640
forecast you have

44
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,640
there's data from these songs and these

45
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,319
songs there are many many songs

46
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,080
alongside in the world and you will see

47
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,500
in the couple slides so to do make Acro

48
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,900
measurements atmospheric parameters

49
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,580
above the surface they send information

50
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,860
back to the real time as soon as

51
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,819
possible to get to get a

52
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,019
precise forecast

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,720
uh this some history of that phone they

54
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,739
like first first song they tried to to

55
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,239
get

56
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,300
of course of course military they're

57
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,739
like uh

58
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,379
need forecast for the

59
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,959
before and Second Battle to get the more

60
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,940
data they can to predict what we're

61
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,379
gonna happen

62
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,379
and they allowance they like you have a

63
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,819
couple

64
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,940
coupled out of here from the Benjamin

65
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,879
Franklin and

66
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:17,120
metal graphs here are the three balloons

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,080
and they released that balloons to the

68
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,300
app to get data and the first day was

69
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,060
like with the wires and they have like

70
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,819
Rudders and trying to get if you want to

71
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,260
go aha to walk and there is like also a

72
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,220
couple

73
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,879
during the time the like technology they

74
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,819
didn't get they uh they didn't have in

75
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,000
the beginning GPS and they uh put the

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,760
helium balloon and the position of the

77
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,519
sounds they track with the some system

78
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,980
and they rather they like to get height

79
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,319
and the precise position of that sound

80
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,080
and after that after that they like

81
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,019
calculate prediction of that sound now

82
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,799
like technology so there was like a lot

83
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,980
and Omega for wind and uh navite system

84
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,599
and very system they like complicated

85
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,019
now to to go deep of that

86
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,738
so uh now you can see the picture of the

87
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,738
every single launch site in the world

88
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,478
and uh

89
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,940
European Union United States and China

90
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,520
they have like very decent uh decent

91
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,919
network of Lifestyle site

92
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,400
uh every single site every single uh

93
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,620
point on the

94
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,040
world map are for

95
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,720
uh

96
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,000
for the song launching so

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,540
every single spot launched

98
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,320
two three four or six songs a day every

99
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,740
four or six hours and uh

100
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,740
we did that of course every single uh

101
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,780
every single spot needs more but it's

102
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,860
very expensive to launch zones

103
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,680
uh that often so for example uh here in

104
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,919
Novi Sad the nearest point to launch

105
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,740
sound is a Sega DIN and Belgrade second

106
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,900
they have like every

107
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,600
12 hours sound launching and the

108
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,800
Belgrade have every six hours

109
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,660
and they trying to put all that together

110
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,479
to get weather forecast

111
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,240
and this is like how a system should

112
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,080
work sound is in the area GPS data going

113
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,259
uh it's on the getting GPS data sending

114
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:39,419
signal on on uh frequencies uh uh you

115
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,259
AJF and the higher frequency above the

116
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,039
one gigahertz sending to the Earth and

117
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,220
there is like collecting data and all

118
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,259
that all day data according to the

119
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,320
European Center and they like U.S Center

120
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,780
European Center they change data and

121
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,580
making the forecast

122
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,500
this is like some

123
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,100
some of the songs how they look like

124
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,419
for history the Visalia is the biggest

125
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:12,419
company to company production of songs

126
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,120
and it's like first songs like was uh

127
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,600
first songs was glass then after that

128
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
like the sun

129
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,759
zero matters and that stuff and now

130
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,160
there's like very expensive very

131
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,500
expensive sensors in that sounds very

132
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,199
very expensive this is like that sounds

133
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,860
I have some of them this is like how uh

134
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,080
how they put the manually they like

135
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,539
put helium in the balloon and balloon in

136
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,759
the lunch site for in the beginning they

137
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,660
were like 100 you have you can see here

138
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,880
152 centimeters diameter of balloon and

139
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,199
becomes seven to ten meters before

140
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,699
bursting

141
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,340
and that's allows on to reach out to the

142
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,740
exists 40 kilometers high

143
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,819
the owner of the Honda is a

144
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,539
H is the owner of saundas every single

145
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,120
Sunday is for example in Serbia owner

146
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,020
are our metal metal government agency

147
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,180
and every every single country is dead

148
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,800
but they are owners until

149
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,840
balloon burst

150
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,199
and when balloon go up they collecting

151
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,660
that and their data are very relevant

152
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,160
when the balloon burst and sondak start

153
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,860
to falling down they don't need any of

154
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,900
their data and their

155
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,060
their don't need that sometime they are

156
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,340
not the owner of that so you can like

157
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,020
collect that sonda and use they measure

158
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,720
temperature humidity wind speed and

159
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,819
direction pressure and there's like I

160
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:57,599
put some uh put some data to see how

161
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,699
precise our instrument inside of the

162
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,240
cylinders and ranges of uh temperature

163
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,000
resolution accuracy and

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,780
accuracy in how fast they send the all

165
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,880
the data I collect temperature humidity

166
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,720
also resolution how fast they they can

167
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,360
get and collecting their data

168
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,240
and there is like wind of course then

169
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,819
not directly measured in between but the

170
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,720
GPS GPS signal is collected and sand the

171
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,720
metals this method meters laurency radio

172
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,520
navigation tracking will be rather there

173
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,860
was like all systems Now GPS is

174
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,979
absolutely absolutely all pressure also

175
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,440
they measure this is the range of the

176
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,299
measuring pressure resolution accuracy

177
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,360
and that this so there's like a very

178
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,940
precise and very expensive instrument in

179
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,040
every single Sons

180
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,580
and the consensus sensor linked to the

181
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,519
battery powered by radio transmitter

182
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,980
radio frequency typically ranging from

183
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,899
uh this is the frequency they transmit

184
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,600
from 1067

185
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,480
6 and to

186
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,700
1060

187
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,640
682 megahertz in United States and

188
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,240
around 440 megahertz in

189
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,620
in Europe

190
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,680
every single site has a different

191
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,700
frequency of launching One Main and one

192
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,100
backup frequency what does it mean for

193
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,100
example every of every song launched for

194
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,080
example 3 pm

195
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,800
by balloon this look like this going up

196
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,279
and the sanding on one frequency sending

197
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,080
all data they collect they have like

198
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,200
this is a this is antenna for

199
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,959
transmitting on this frequency here is

200
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,339
like a UHF frequency 400 or 3 megahertz

201
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,860
and around plus minus this is stroke

202
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,500
secondine and every single sun has like

203
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,080
uh temperature

204
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,899
this temperature pressure and inside

205
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,779
this GPS receiver and this is antenna

206
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,779
for transmitter and they transmit

207
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:08,459
transmit for the next eight hours all

208
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,860
data they collecting

209
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,800
after eight hours they automatically

210
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,380
turning off so next sound

211
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,959
Nexon can be launched for the same site

212
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,200
and they trying to avoid the two zones

213
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,660
in the same size same time in the same

214
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,120
frequency backup frequency feels like

215
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,100
sometimes this sound can be broken and

216
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,580
transmit uh transmit

217
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,959
two or three days and they like want to

218
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,399
they can uh

219
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,620
they they can

220
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,440
they can transmit two or four days and

221
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,200
uh other song can use that frequency if

222
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,740
he's this sound is broken

223
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:55,500
and this is a hunting uh song Hub is uh

224
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,040
one of the biggest biggest web site they

225
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,360
present uh that present all uh all song

226
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,360
radio Sound in the moment in the air

227
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,519
every single

228
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,440
Green Dot

229
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,779
are a receiver

230
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,440
for example radio clubs have also one of

231
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,180
that receiver

232
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,000
which is them back every single dot is

233
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,720
the server you can buy a receiver like

234
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,079
in uh Ali Express for like five or ten

235
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,019
bucks put that receiver online

236
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,200
and send data for this radio Zone you

237
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,660
can receive in your uh your neighborhood

238
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,240
for example you can receive Belgrade

239
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,200
uh Belgrade Croatia Sega din Budapest

240
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,320
something some from Romania and you will

241
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,320
fill out the all that server data like

242
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,240
all others uh receivers around the

243
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,120
Europe for example the Europe is a

244
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,800
interesting for us

245
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,060
so this sound is a

246
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,600
only radio song that we can catch here

247
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,180
in this in void in this part of Serbia

248
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,180
because uh is launched from segedim and

249
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,240
winds usually go south

250
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,320
uh

251
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,260
they I will show you just on the next

252
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,040
slide okay uh winds blowing South and

253
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,320
you can get that that sound here and

254
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,200
Define that sound around the novices

255
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,040
and around the segedin we can get

256
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,459
radio Zone from Belgrade because uh

257
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:40,019
winds are very rare blowing to the north

258
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,139
this song is launched from Belgrade

259
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,200
and this sound is a a little bit cheaper

260
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,899
than this from second for example this

261
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,500
uh sound is a made in France is like

262
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,100
50 euros is new one electronic and is

263
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,740
also precise but not that

264
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,519
precise like this one this is some that

265
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,399
used in whole Europe European Union

266
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,180
and this radio sound when the countries

267
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,360
buy from the

268
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,540
they paint this sound 200 Euros because

269
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,060
of instrument debt and they launch every

270
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,639
for example Budapest is and second in

271
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,339
their lunch every single uh 12 hours

272
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,800
they launch these songs for example

273
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,620
Germany alongside they launch this and

274
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,959
every single eight hours there is like

275
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,940
United States they launched these songs

276
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,360
every four hours to get as

277
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,680
they can get

278
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,320
it so uh

279
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,839
why you

280
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,720
why you would do that why you'd like go

281
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,660
to find this Honda in the field go

282
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,899
around and try to get this Sunday this

283
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:02,880
is the sonda inside and all this uh all

284
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,700
this data I'll collected from like this

285
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,000
this part is like these sensors sensor

286
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,940
and this is on the inside

287
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,959
uh with firmware flesh and you can reuse

288
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,100
this Honda

289
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,279
for what for example if you have this

290
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,720
Honda

291
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,320
you can use this on the like uh

292
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,420
Wireless weather station

293
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,820
for example if you flash this Honda and

294
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,040
put somewhere but wherever you want you

295
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,320
can get like pressure

296
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,260
temperature you can get

297
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,600
you can get pressure temperature and a

298
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,139
GPS location of that location where is

299
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,240
like this Honda you can receive

300
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,440
wirelessly this wirelessly all data

301
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,660
with this

302
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,820
some of this radio station this is like

303
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,339
about thing walkie-talkie

304
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,160
30 bucks on AliExpress

305
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,420
so

306
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,579
when you

307
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,680

this is like

311
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,860
original mud

312
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,720

you

314
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,579
turn off this Honda I will show you how

315
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,000
it's like

316
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:29,760
uh Sunday uh now this Sunday is on

317
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,120
and it takes like outside takes like a

318
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,399
couple minutes to get GPS signal and

319
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,180
every single second

320
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,440
send data about

321
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,260
everything around

[Applause]

323
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,220
this one is working

[Applause]

325
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,380
so when it's green everything is okay

when it's red something is wrong here

327
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,019
that there we don't have GPS signal

328
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:10,380
in this is error so now this song

329
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,959
transmitting all data around pressure

330
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,619
temperature and location uh with

331
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,959
[Applause]

332
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,320
this is like how hunting uh this is also

a sound Hub how hunting working so for

334
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,959
hunting equipment to get this Honda

335
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,100
you need the receiver Dakota map

336
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,699
receiver you can use this receiver there

337
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,860
is like many free softwares on internet

338
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,620
you can like uh only this out you put

339
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,160
inside uh inside laptop and get the code

340
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,139
data absolutely all data from this sound

341
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,399
uh

342
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,620
all data from this sound and what we

343
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,820
need is GPS location of dead zone but uh

344
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,620
this is like just a show this is like

345
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,980
the the beginning laptop has their uh

346
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,439
soft and The Fan radio and antenna the

347
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,959
beginning of that uh catching that sound

348
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,540
but now uh

349
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:16,439
all we use is Laura tetago Laura 32 this

350
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,059
this

351
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:22,099
piece of equipment this is likely the 3D

352
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:25,380
3D case

353
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,319
the white slot I don't know probably uh

354
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,720
many of you are familiar with this

355
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,000
device this device is like

356
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,940
intended to for a lower Network on

357
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,880
frequency 200

358
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,760
433 megahertz and this is like allowed

359
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,200
allowed frequency to work

360
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,660
but

361
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,480
this device also can be moved to the

362
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,679
frequency of this radio radius on so you

363
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,840
can like flash this

364
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,059
this device with the firmware

365
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,039
a flash device with the firmware and you

366
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,760
can find many many many many many

367
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,620
favorites fevers on the internet to

368
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,559
flash this uh category device

369
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,580
if you want to like get uh get better

370
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,740
get better reception

371
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,400
you need external antenna some of them

372
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,520
some antenna because this device I show

373
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,919
you the first one is a

374
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,120
is a made for the frequency of 433

375
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,640
megahertz and we are moving to the

376
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,860
frequency 403 402 404 the frequency of

377
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,059
the Saunders

378
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,480
and the reception is a little bad not

379
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,179
very good so you need to go

380
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:48,120
as close as possible like two hundreds

381
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,620
or 300 meters around the

382
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,400
prediction of a spot where the Suns goes

383
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,660
with this device

384
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,419
this walkie-talkie you can hear this

385
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,760
something like kilometers or two but is

386
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,559
like very hard too difficult directly

387
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,940
from this

388
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,900
is working but not always

389
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,280
but with this device

390
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,520
with Device category Laura 32 is always

391
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,919
working but you need to be close with

392
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,559
this antenna very close with this

393
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,600
antenna something like this you can find

394
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,660
on internet many uh many tutorials how

395
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,960
to made the antenna for this this Sunday

396
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,539
hunting and the measurement and the yagi

397
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,760
antenna logo there is like many types of

398
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,380
antenna called collaterals and

399
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,880
everything you can find on internet to

400
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,039
make make a

401
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,600
May container to get that Saunders

402
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:48,080
the best and yes this this device

403
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:54,539
very famous device so uh hell like Wi-Fi

404
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,460
and Bluetooth

405
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,620
so this guy

406
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,200
this guy Mirko Del Monte is Italian

407
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,919
guide also ham radio operator with uh

408
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,400
this calls I need to resolution Nancy

409
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,460
made application this is the name free

410
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,919
application my Sunday go and you can

411
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,580
install that application you can

412
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,600
programming to go frequency

413
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,160
with Bluetooth programming frequency and

414
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,400
waiting to get catch signal with device

415
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,919
application will get a application we

416
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,100
will get all data from the sonda the

417
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,620
code and show on the map where are you

418
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,900
and where are the where is the sonda in

419
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,360
that moment so it's like with this

420
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,220
application this part of the equipment

421
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,980
is very easy to find the to find the

422
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,220
Sunda for example this uh also live data

423
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,080
from from the Sunday live data Sunday

424
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,299
every one second this burst you can see

425
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:55,639
in uh every single

426
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,679
[Applause]

427
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,460
so in every single burst of of data you

428
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,660
inside this burst you can find uh

429
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,559
velocity you can attitude the

430
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,840
time whether you see coordinates battery

431
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,720
level humidity pressure all this how

432
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,419
many satellites satellites on the uh

433
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:21,059
getting in in this moment so you can in

434
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,740
temperature and everything so you can

435
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,740
you can all this data can see on your

436
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,780
phone live

437
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,299
when you you have that that part of the

438
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,720
equipment so it's like very easy to find

439
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,240
no it's not very easy to find it's very

440
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,559
easy to locate

441
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:41,280
where is the sonda but he's a very hard

442
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,260
to get Sandra through the

443
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,380
Madden

444
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,419
mud and uh

445
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,360
oh wait wait just a moment I wanna

446
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,380
I wanna play like I find one short video

447
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,980
on YouTube for with

448
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,220
with the

449
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,659
hunting the first one is the hunting

450
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,820
members of our

451
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,080
clubs just a moment

452
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,539
what's happening right now

453
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,360
wait wait wait

454
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,220
wait

455
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,000
it's already a club

456
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,380
so this is the our first

457
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,760
uh radios on so we came and also the the

458
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,140
video of this this video is uh recorded

459
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,080
and I cut a little a little bit not to

460
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,520
be too long

461
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,320
and uh

462
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,900
we start recording

463
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,700
two hours

464
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,580
after we came so you will see it's not

465
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,980
like completely dark in the beginning of

466
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,280
the video but just imagine like we start

467
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,960
to uh

468
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,780
find Sunda

469
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,740
Premiere

470
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,760
yeah this is the video nearby

471
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,980
all right

472
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,840
like there was like cold and we

473
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,179
we're trying to get something we

474
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,220
we was thinking oh yeah we will find the

475
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,600
sound of with all this equipment

476
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,480
last four hours

477
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,700
and it was like very cold you will see

478
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,600
them

479
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,860
and that's the reason because we don't

480
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,080
we didn't have external antenna we only

481
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,640
had this this uh

482
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,700
this uh walkie-talkie and this small

483
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,900
device look we are still still trying to

484
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,039
locate but they found it

485
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,860
yeah yeah there's like the same surge

486
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,719
the first surge the first surge yeah

487
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,280
is this one

488
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,780
so we

489
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,179
have this

490
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:40,080
and uh

491
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,159
with this device well like we we could

492
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,280
hurt the Sunday but did uh we didn't

493
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,000
table uh

494
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,480
coordinates but after

495
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,820
we approached the sonda

496
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,659
uh uh like 300 meters or less the small

497
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:01,940
device

498
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,919
Geo like start to look at the coding

499
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:09,480
signals on the screen on the phone and

500
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,840
after that was like easy wait just try

501
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,460
to to play

502
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,380
another one this is like from YouTube

503
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,440
wait also this is like radio amateur

504
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,520
stuff

505
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,159
in just the moment I found

506
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,460
also this is like but I didn't we didn't

507
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,200
record the

508
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,580
record the uh

561
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,590
[Applause]

562
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,539

[Music]

565
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:14,580
so it's not like it's evolving a lot of

566
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,280
time and

567
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,149
[Music]

568
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:22,610
uh

569
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,880

573
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,360
uh

574
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,820
it's so don't go after rain never

576
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:50,100
[Music]

577
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,399
you try because it's like you you need a

578
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:54,600
lot of time

579
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,380
and you need a lot of strength

580
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,720
and

581
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,279
I walk

582
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:05,399
for once under like 15 kilometers

583
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:06,740
One Direction

584
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,559
[Music]

585
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,620
pointless if you like it's not like just

586
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,740
to hunt uh Saunders and together Sanders

587
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,460
it's like uh if you can reuse and find

588
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,559
the I don't know

589
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,440
something new to do with this song that

590
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,220
is it's a

591
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,940
yeah yeah yes that's it also this this

592
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,820
you if you of course you need time for

593
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,520
this because you know alongside you know

594
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,080
like a weather prediction

595
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:45,299
look like the when you see in this like

596
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,539
long uh long wire to the balloon

597
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:51,659
I mean I think 50 meters or something

598
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,799
and they found this

599
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,000
it's like

600
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,559
is this one the same one

601
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,039
[Music]

602
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,940
so this is this one is in very very good

603
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,580
conditions and everything is like

604
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,860
in good condition so that's it

605
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,159
any questions

606
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,279
[Applause]

607
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,260
what is the feeling what is the feeling

608
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,980
of when you are uh speaking with your

609
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,200
radio station and uh

610
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,860
uh your friend is uh recording that

611
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,219
event

612
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,220
well the the first uh first radio Sound

613
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,740
was like

614
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,320
uh because there's the new event and

615
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,659
when you came uh came there uh when you

616
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:00,299
come there you can first you can you

617
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:02,100
can't hear

618
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,559
on this radio station and the first was

619
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,480
like you heard

620
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,620
with very low signal and after that

621
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,080
signal is stronger stronger and you know

622
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,480
you know you are closer and that's the

623
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,159
reason why the first one we like looking

624
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,500
for for the couple hours because we knew

625
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,799
it will is around and we passed by a

626
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,080
couple times around the Saunders around

627
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,000
the Saunders and when we found like he's

628
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,840
like

629
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,600
I was like adrenaline now so it's like

630
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,080
it's very nice to kill time to go out to

631
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,899
walk because I'm not the person to go

632
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:37,860
like

633
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,179
uh

634
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:42,059
uh without any transportation 100 meters

635
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,279
but for this I like I walked 15

636
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:46,260
kilometers One Direction to find one

637
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:50,000
Sunday so it's like very interesting

638
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,799
if I set up the laptop yeah

639
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,799
okay

640
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,700
this Honda has like transmitting power

641
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,299
200 milliwatts on 400 megahertz is like

642
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:18,960
a lot of power for example if you have

643
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,440
some of this external antenna and this

644
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,200
you will be able to receive this Sunday

645
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,380
10 or 15 kilometers but if it's on the

646
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,820
nail

647
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,740
and when the sun are going down down

648
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,080
down and on the Earth

649
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,860
under it you will be able to receive

650
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,320
son.2 or three kilometers depends

651
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,659
how flat is the surface around the

652
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:45,299
Sunder and how

653
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:48,179
this antenna is like stacked if it's

654
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:52,860
down you will need to be as as close as

655
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,019
possible like one kilometers if it's

656
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:57,299
antenna like this you will hear Santa

657
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:00,659
and all that uh five kilometers and when

658
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:03,240
you receive the first signal

659
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,440
if you like have a good antenna for the

660
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,520
small TTG Laura device you will be able

661
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,199
to decode when you decode the

662
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,739
coordination

663
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,099
you just need to walk that's all

664
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,899
you don't have

665
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:23,339
to basically you can do it with Android

666
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:26,159
phone you can do with the with the phone

667
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,040
you can do with like uh sdl software

668
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,899
defined radio and the laptop you can

669
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,839
like many ways but you need receiver

670
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,719
decoder and map

671
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:38,580
is just small that's white yeah that's

672
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,739
like practical you can like put the this

673
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,080
this one also have like a battery behind

674
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,699
you can put the battery and you can like

675
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:49,560
go is a uh for example you you

676
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,179
need only device to the code and get GPS

677
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:57,900
data after that you can like type that

678
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,780
up in any any other device you have GPS

679
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,240
you can find like paper map if you're

680
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,800
like

681
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,339
thanks

682
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,660
and how long the battery is lasting on

683
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,460
this how long it will transmit I know

684
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,140
that battery is some ecological thing

685
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,440
yes yes yes yes yes yes uh well uh good

686
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,660
question uh well uh song song

687
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,000
this program to

688
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
stop transmitting uh for example if if

689
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,660
uh segedin transmit a launch sound every

690
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:38,820
12 12 hours some yields program to stop

691
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,940
transmitting after eight hours but when

692
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,460
sound is broken also depends on the

693
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,680
temperature

694
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,660
if outside is the summer

695
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,599
this can last like three four five days

696
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,140
is the winter like couple days two days

697
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,140
and also it depends uh depends of the

698
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,720
whether you know like on the 10 10

699
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,540
kilometers like minus 60 so it's like

700
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,640
also this is the the reason why is like

701
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,480
and this battery we can catch this on

702
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,119
the like one years ago and the battery

703
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:15,060
is still uh still okay but

704
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,578
it was like in my uh living room

705
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,420
and I think that they used something

706
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,700
some like Echo battery because if it

707
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,380
falls into water or something yeah yeah

708
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,839
it was like uh this one no no it's not

709
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:33,839
lithium battery the battery is like I

710
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,640
know it was like you need to soak this

711
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,920
battery into the salt water and then it

712
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,500
gets like an hour for 10 hours no no but

713
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,740
like it's like you you this uh if

714
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,619
someone wanna see this also uh this

715
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:49,260
sensors and everything is very uh

716
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,839
expensive equipment but this like you

717
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,160
can many of these songs like uh in the

718
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,859
in the land somewhere and like people

719
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:02,160
just go by I I found one in a

720
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,400
in the middle between two Villages like

721
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,900
and uh it was like big mug tomorrow if I

722
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,540
laid there was like under the core or

723
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,450
also yeah buried down

724
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,500
[Music]

725
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,660
no we can open this one if you want okay

726
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,820
later later we will open this one it's

727
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,640
okay you can like find all data and what

728
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,180
uh one more thing uh

729
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,800
uh one more thing uh when uh when they

730
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,640
buy this Honda from the manufacturer

731
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,520
every single Sunder has like a serial

732
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,220
number and on this

733
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,980
sound Hub I'll show you now you can like

734
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,099
enter this number and find what happened

735
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:54,180
this Honda and when they get this Honda

736
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,599
uh all all uh

737
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,320
stuff programmed inside of the same

738
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,460
you'll own Europe except frequency

739
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,099
and except frequency and serial number

740
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,740
but serial number is like also

741
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,339
programmed inside and what they do then

742
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:18,060
before launch some uh some country they

743
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,140
have a

744
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,359
they have automatic launch site with

745
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,820
like big container and just they

746
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,720
balances go go up every single eight

747
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,200
hours they put this this Sunday on some

748
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,540
frequency program after the click the

749
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,820
frequency of that sonda

750
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,820
programmed and they send sound up that's

751
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,119
it so end and

752
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,300
if you want to like reuse this Sunday

753
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,300
you can program all data in Sunday and

754
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,079
change modulation frequency

755
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,440
time of descending power from 0 to 200

756
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,339
milliwatts everything what is the what

757
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:02,040
Factory put inside Factory you can

758
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,800
change frequency you can change but when

759
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,480
sonda get out

760
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,260
of a battery or like just without power

761
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,040
they will back on the programmed

762
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,839
settings just frequency all of the stuff

763
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,859
you can you can like program by by now

764
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:23,660
but we are working on that

765
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,599
oh

766
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,740
okay

767
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,919
thank you

768
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:40,119
[Applause]

769
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,720
I don't know maybe some of

770
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:47,579
you already

771
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:51,480
so this is the long side this is live uh

772
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,560
but our left side you use C or all

773
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,839
Saunders for example if you click just

774
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,020
this Sunday this on the for example look

775
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,540
this is the the for example where is the

776
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,680
Paris and launch uh West part of Paris

777
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,339
this is like uh wind and this is the

778
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:12,180
last

779
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,339
receiver

780
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:18,300
who received this let's see what is this

781
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:22,380
so this is the some french guy and he

782
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,480
has a Raspberry Pi

783
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,359
free with as their receiver and the

784
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,180
diamond Dix 50 very good antenna and he

785
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,000
did the last last received the location

786
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,260
of sonda and this is all all uh sonda

787
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,940
data received this is for example

788
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,160
frequency of the that launch site and

789
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,140
all the stuff radio clubs

790
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,720
we bought one of that Laura just to be

791
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,880
fixed in the radio club

792
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,480
this is uh this is uh live you know

793
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,460
live all Sunday for example this is

794
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,900
Belgrade

795
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,740
better lunch site look this is the how

796
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,700
weather

797
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,579
on a wind blowing

798
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:06,780
on

799
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,900
certain Heights but look this this is

800
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,460
interesting for example when you watch

801
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,800
Saunders look every Sundays go the same

802
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,320
direction because

803
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,839
wind winds are blowing from the same

804
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,940
direction and you can see product you

805
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,720
can see prediction of the Thunder path

806
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,500
and you can see for example

807
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,500
this is a receiver of the radio club

808
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,740
s

809
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,980
this Sunday's last from

810
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:51,260
and look don't go for this one

811
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:57,180
this one is like don't go so the

812
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:01,440
and you you would uh think because they

813
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,079
they launch every single 12 hours there

814
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,859
is a lot of saundas but yes and no some

815
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,480
uh

816
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,300
for example they launched from segedin I

817
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,500
live in Israel

818
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,760
and I would go 15 20 30 kilometers

819
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,160
around Australian but I would not go 100

820
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,920
kilometers to get this Honda and the

821
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,859
winds are going like uh there was like

822
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:29,040
time uh five days on the go to the

823
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,440
Belgrade from second in a five days ago

824
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,040
like to the I don't know like just to go

825
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,980
across the border so you need to wait

826
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,960
like couple days around the Australian

827
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,780
and this like wind change direction and

828
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,380
you have to follow every single day

829
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,180
this is Stereo stuff you know there was

830
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,640
like application you can put your

831
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,880
location and to draw the area when you

832
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,220
like uh going to catch the Sunday and

833
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,140
the sun when the prediction go in that

834
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,180
area you will get notification be ready

835
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,060
go for Sunday also and

836
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,400
so

837
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,180
just one more thing and we are done

838
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,540
for example this is last six hours to

839
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,079
see how

840
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:19,880
how let's go

841
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,520
look at this guy this guy took this guy

842
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:30,859
uh for example if you have like this

843
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:34,619
