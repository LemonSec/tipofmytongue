5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,900
welcome back everyone our next topic is

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,460
on Hardware hacking please welcome

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,539
vladani College

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,960
thank you hi everyone

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,579
so let us start so this is going to be a

10
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,800
talk about Hardware hacking some

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,660
interesting stuff I hope

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,480
so let me first start

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,039
a little bit about me so I'm not going

14
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,440
into details more about me but I just

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,399
want to say that that Balkan actually

16
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,739
ticks all the box of my interests

17
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,340
so it's perfect conference to be here so

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,199
and always glad to be in in beautiful

19
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,880
city of novice nuts I hope you are

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,640
enjoying your time here these days after

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,860
two years of being far far away from

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,880
here

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,799
so I hope this will be interesting so we

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,380
are going to discuss a little bit about

25
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,060
problems with current problems with the

26
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,119
Hardware security and how and what we

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,380
can do to address this situation and and

28
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,259
how to actually start doing Hardware

29
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,119
testing

30
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,820
so first thing that I want to make sure

31
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,680
that we all understand is difference

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,860
between hardware and software so I I

33
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,540
know we all know what are harder

34
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,579
Hardware

35
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:43,079
uh strong things made of stuff and

36
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,939
software is something imaginary that can

37
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,299
run or that stuff or in the cloud

38
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:50,820
recently but when we are discussing

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,399
harder here we are talking about devices

40
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,500
which do not run any explicit user code

41
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,100
so they come already with programs on

42
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,560
them if they need any programs so

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,360
everything is embedded in that package

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,179
and we can just use this device for

45
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,700
every any purpose that we might need to

46
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,160
use that device on the other side when

47
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,920
we speak about software we speak about

48
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,920
user space software so something that is

49
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,860
created or loaded onto device by the

50
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,200
user itself so something that is under

51
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
our control generally at least the hope

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,300
so it is under our control

53
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,220
uh and of course operating system itself

54
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,540
is is part of that problem right now is

55
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,180
that this distinguish between hardware

56
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,420
and software is getting a little bit

57
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,099
more hazy so it is no longer clearly

58
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,140
said because for example you have modern

59
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,660
TVs which would be embedded device by

60
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,700
definition but you still can run your

61
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,739
own code on it because you can download

62
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,640
stuff from Google market or any market

63
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,819
and run your user space software so this

64
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,920
is becoming more and more interesting

65
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,260
distinguished but it is not so easy

66
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,300
anymore but we for the purpose of this

67
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,060
talk we are going to keep this strict

68
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,800
separation between those and we are not

69
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,780
going to address that fun stuff

70
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,879
we will leave that for some other balcon

71
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,019
few years in the future I hope

72
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,140
so let me start first but we all work

73
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,780
with software daily and we accept the

74
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,340
software is not secure

75
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,220
because it is controlled by user itself

76
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,159
user can put any kind of software and

77
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,800
can modify this software and make it

78
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,800
make it unsafe but this is not something

79
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,560
new this is the situation that started

80
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,900
long long time ago since the first time

81
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,540
we had any software practically running

82
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,480
on anything so

83
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,519
as soon as we have connected computers

84
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,379
we had the first real malware it was

85
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,580
called creeper it was developed in 1971

86
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,940
and ran on arpanet which was like 30

87
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,760
computers connected around the world so

88
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,739
Within These 30 computers there was one

89
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,120
guy who decided oh I want to make

90
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,060
something fun and he created a creeper

91
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,739
software which was

92
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,099
simple so if idea is did this piece of

93
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,720
code will just move between different

94
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,079
PDP 10 computers and just print message

95
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,199
that I'm showing here

96
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,840
and after that he would migrate itself

97
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,600
to another node in the network

98
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,300
so and the time when we get first virus

99
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,400
we get first antivirus so another guy

100
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,040
who was sick of this game created two

101
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,660
called Reaper and that was first

102
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,100
antivirus

103
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,960
so we started implementing software

104
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,600
controls and the sole purpose of Reaper

105
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,479
is to search for creeper or nodes into

106
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,520
this extinguish it

107
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,100
uh that was a long time ago but we still

108
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,380
can see this code because

109
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,740
there is a game called core War so it is

110
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,080
no longer so important but when I was

111
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,360
young my sole dream was to participate

112
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,699
in Cold War games so core war is

113
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,060
practically a sandbox with some

114
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,639
imaginary Assembly Language and you have

115
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,740
two pieces of code which try to kill

116
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,100
each other

117
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,120
so there are a lot of algorithms that

118
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,860
they are using but the idea is one

119
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,500
program must kill all threads from

120
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,000
another program

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,120
so it is still available I believe so we

122
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,100
had one competition this year so if you

123
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,600
are interested in that you can search it

124
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,340
out

125
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,919
so we are aware that software is not

126
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,620
safe not secure but we usually assume

127
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,300
that our Hardware

128
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,940
might actually be secure

129
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,820
I'm not sure if that is true

130
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,759
but for the purpose of this call we will

131
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,600
consider that t t 800 is still far away

132
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,639
in the future and that he will not

133
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,979
attack us immediately

134
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,979
so I at least I hope so

135
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,020
so let us see actually what is the

136
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,820
current situation and do we have

137
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,039
something to fear

138
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,919
let's address simple Hardware tool and

139
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,199
let's try to analyze

140
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,419
threat model for for this Hardware tool

141
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,000
so it is very simple and very very old

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,220
piece of Hardware it fulfills definition

143
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,440
of how that cannot run any user software

144
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,440
on it and it was developed for one

145
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,820
single purpose

146
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,840
to paint male fingernails in Black

147
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,639
during the time we discovered that it

148
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,139
can be useful for other things so we

149
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,639
were hacking our tool already so we

150
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,259
discovered that we can hit things with

151
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,539
it either there are nails

152
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,580
and we started using it

153
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,680
but thread model on this device is

154
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,440
fairly simple so it can be misused by us

155
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,720
or somebody can steal it and try to

156
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,080
paint our toenails on black in black

157
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,900
so protection of such device is fairly

158
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,460
simple so you need just to rely on

159
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,900
physical security

160
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,600
so lock your tools

161
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,940
and you are safe to go

162
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,860
but this is really simple model let us

163
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,500
try something also old but a little bit

164
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
more complex than a simple Hammer so

165
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,120
let's speak about my one of my favorite

166
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,100
computers as I already mentioned I like

167
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,900
retro computers and to be honest I spend

168
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,660
too much time with jarco in in Retro

169
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,120
Room this year so don't don't hate me

170
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,419
for that

171
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,300
this is a bigger computer Amiga 500 and

172
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,000
it is not so old I think some of you

173
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,660
might be as old as I am and might have

174
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,120
opportunity to play with this computer

175
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,160
and security model of this computer is

176
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,319
actually also quite simple

177
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,440
this computer was rarely connected and

178
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,419
most of the problems that we had this

179
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:42,240
computer security related is when we

180
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,539
exchanged backups of versions of backup

181
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:46,979
versions of software in order to test

182
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,080
them for our friends

183
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,000
and that is the time when we could

184
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,780
caught some malicious virus which the

185
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,819
the worst one was actually destroying

186
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,800
floppy device so it would just start

187
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,740
hitting heads until they fall off

188
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,340
but still that is just vandalism there

189
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,199
is no real threat you can lose your

190
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,440
floppy drive and that's it so there was

191
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,020
no personal data there was nothing that

192
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,560
can endanger endanger you in in using

193
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,880
this computer

194
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,440
and hacking

195
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,900
with this platform it was usually meant

196
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,080
we are going to find a way to employ

197
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,300
so we have developed a lot of expansions

198
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,879
for this computer to make it work

199
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,199
something that it is not supposed to

200
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,299
work so now we have connectivity we can

201
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,640
connect Amigas to internet we can have

202
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,380
more powerful processor although it is

203
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,700
not supposed to have more powerful

204
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,580
processor so we have developed a lot of

205
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,000
harder hacks in order to enhance and

206
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,760
make this platform uh useful even to

207
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,180
this day

208
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,459
okay

209
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:57,180
so what actually went wrong since that

210
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,500
time

211
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,680
so first thing is future creep

212
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,019
so it is very common in harder forums if

213
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,760
you post something that you have done in

214
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,440
Hardware that you will get smashed

215
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,300
whatever you did if you could create

216
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,120
blinking lights by using nf555 there

217
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,680
will be somebody who asked oh but five

218
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,240
you use Danny 555 you can use

219
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,459
microcontroller it's much more versatile

220
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:20,240
that then you go and implement it in

221
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,200
microcontroller and still you have your

222
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,760
blinking lights

223
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,980
and you post again proud of yourself

224
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,980
that you upgraded put it and then why

225
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,140
did you spend so much time programming

226
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,519
microcontroller already can be done by

227
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,060
simple na55 which is I think 50 years

228
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,860
old already

229
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,200
so this uh

230
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,700
make a lot of problems because right now

231
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,980
microprocessors are really cheap so I

232
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,279
have here one example this is paduk PMS

233
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,980
150 it costs like three cents when

234
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,300
bought in China

235
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,120
and it is full featured microcontroller

236
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,399
so it is much cheaper than a formation

237
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,839
nf555 so when designers make decision

238
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,300
about which kind of Hardware they will

239
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,320
put

240
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,540
in their device that they are right now

241
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,700
developing they are no longer bound by

242
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,980
oh let's go with chip

243
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,839
because everything is cheap of course

244
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,339
when you find it right now we have

245
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:20,820
problem with a lot of harder devices but

246
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,459
generally microcontrollers become really

247
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,980
cheap and omnipresent so even in a

248
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,019
simple greeting card that you see the

249
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,300
thing you have small microprocessor

250
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,140
inside

251
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,180
so devices are becoming much more

252
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,040
powerful and much clever much more

253
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,320
functional than they were before so they

254
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,440
can run a lot of software and hardware

255
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,660
and sometimes we are not even aware of

256
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,640
what is possible to accomplish by using

257
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,260
simple device

258
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,560
of course then we came to another great

259
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,120
idea and that is let's connect those

260
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,000
dumb devices and create Internet of

261
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,200
Things

262
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,240
so we have decided to integrate our

263
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,880
smart devices because why not not

264
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,920
imprinting us so we have a lot more fun

265
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,060
we can control each other devices and

266
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,740
they can speak with themselves they can

267
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,620
serve and make our life better is it the

268
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,339
truth we'll see might be but as one of

269
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,920
the consequences of this is that they

270
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,040
are integrated in our daily life so we

271
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,040
have these devices everywhere everywhere

272
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,019
around us

273
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,420
and we sometimes are not even aware of

274
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,980
those and

275
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,560
if you recall few months ago there was a

276
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,740
big pile of news that some Google

277
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,260
programmers started by yelling oh we

278
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,180
have sent the entire AI

279
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,700
so is it true that I don't think so but

280
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,680
I that would be not not the first time

281
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,060
that I'm not right

282
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,740
so if I don't believe it it doesn't mean

283
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,440
it's not true so there is a big chance

284
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,420
that if you don't already have sentient

285
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,779
AI that soon we will help

286
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,880
and I think we had a many many many

287
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,200
movies

288
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,200
which told us that sentient I is not

289
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,839
really good idea

290
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,720
but that didn't prevent us

291
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,500
so we are pretty destructive species so

292
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,519
we have

293
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,680
one idea that drives our progress and

294
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,079
that is our

295
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,480
wish to destroy as much of our species

296
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,640
as possible in a very simple way so we

297
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,160
decided okay we have Smart devices we

298
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,140
have maybe Essentials so let's let's

299
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,040
give it the guns

300
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,399
again I cannot stop thinking about

301
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,800
Terminator films all the time whenever

302
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,140
I'm watching stuff like this

303
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,839
so what is going to control and and

304
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,779
prevent these devices to make their own

305
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:48,060
decisions which might not be aligned

306
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,880
with what we actually want

307
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,100
so right now we still believe that

308
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,700
humans are in control so the guy behind

309
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,160
I think this is remote control I really

310
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,300
hope so

311
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,500
or at least big powerful kill switch

312
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,839
because if this this

313
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:09,060
what is it like dogs start running at me

314
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,740
I'm

315
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,180
I don't know what they're going to do

316
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,880
but I will not run far away for sure

317
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,040
so there is nothing preventing this

318
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,519
device to be confused what is Real Enemy

319
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,660
and what is just bystander so

320
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,380
so I'm not sure how much of of of good

321
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,500
idea is to to to give guns to autonomous

322
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,660
machines but hey somebody thought it is

323
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,360
great idea so let's do it

324
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,260
uh but okay let's let's uh move from

325
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,660
those uh scary things let's

326
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,000
start analyzing something that is a

327
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,519
little bit more close to us so as I

328
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,760
mentioned uh these devices are

329
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,680
everywhere so first one that I actually

330
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,600
encountered many many years ago over

331
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,100
smart bulbs

332
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,040
I had friend who had great idea he

333
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,440
bought a bulb connected into his home

334
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
and connected it to his Facebook account

335
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,300
because why not it's feature that is

336
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,500
supported and in all its wisdom idea was

337
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,079
okay when somebody tagged you on a

338
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:17,220
picture your bulb will change a color to

339
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,720
the predominant color of the picture

340
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,000
so we have a lot of fun and we decided

341
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,500
okay we'll put

342
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,240
fully black pictures

343
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,320
and tag him

344
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,899
so okay this was just a joke on his side

345
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:36,660
but uh problem is if it can be also

346
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,779
dangerous because if somebody decides to

347
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,699
rob you it is nice to to leave you out

348
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,320
off site

349
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,079
so if you are in dark you cannot see

350
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,060
what is happening around you and you

351
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,760
might be in not so good position

352
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,579
so this this kind of Integrations are

353
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,560
everywhere and they are

354
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,500
uh pretty tricky because sometimes even

355
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,899
manufacturers are not aware of

356
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,300
consequences of such features even if

357
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,800
they know that they implemented these

358
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
features

359
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,320
so how my favorite topic so I had many

360
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,320
many presentations about this topic and

361
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,480
this is about connected cars and not

362
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,120
just connected cars so car should have

363
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,339
only one purpose to drive us from point

364
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:23,519
A to point B safely and securely

365
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,680
but again we decided we want to program

366
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,540
our cars

367
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,820
so like any computer so it becomes

368
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,040
practically robot on Wheel

369
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,320
so it can be autonomous so we see that

370
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,180
there are many Teslas with self

371
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,860
navigation features that will drive

372
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,279
drive themselves while you gently sleeps

373
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,699
and then we also have one question what

374
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,860
will happen when this car encounters our

375
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,899
Serbian roads

376
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,699
that would be real test to see what will

377
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,720
happen and what will happen if if

378
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,579
there must be decision by the car is it

379
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,980
going to kill one person that drives the

380
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,260
car or one person that is in front of

381
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,100
the car

382
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,620
so that is ethical dilemma that

383
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,800
computers are not good at solving

384
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,720
so people will try to find another

385
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,480
solution but computers are limited and

386
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,980
they do only what is programmed and

387
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,959
their ultimate programming is to prevent

388
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:20,279
uh driver to be harmed

389
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,860
and even if it is not self-driving or

390
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,220
autonomous autonomous car in in modern

391
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,760
carbs there is about 200 different

392
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,339
programmable pieces of hardware

393
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,120
so most of us think about there is one

394
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,000
big computer that that is in charge of

395
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,980
our car but that is far from the road so

396
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,199
if we first have one that controls our

397
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:43,980
comfort

398
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,959
so it is inside cabin and control stuff

399
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:49,079
like AC there is another one who

400
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,880
controls our airbags there is another

401
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,699
one who controls motor rail uh who

402
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,920
controls transmission units there is

403
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,839
this device which controls transmission

404
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,880
unit control device

405
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,940
so there are many many of them so uh

406
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,280
there is I think I'm not going to write

407
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,280
I think seven million lines of code goes

408
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,619
into programming a single car

409
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,980
it's huge amount of code and

410
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,319
car should not be able to do anything

411
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,299
else except drive you from 0.8 from

412
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,619
point B but

413
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,359
but right now you can connect your phone

414
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,140
to it you can connect to internet

415
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,079
your Telemetry your personal data is

416
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,679
regularly uploaded into the cloud

417
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,840
and now manufacturers are also switching

418
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,600
to one more step of control so we are

419
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,160
not going to buy our cars but we're

420
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,480
going to lease

421
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,880
and all features inside car will be

422
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,820
released so you buy a car okay excellent

423
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,500
so you pay like three or five hundred

424
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,260
bucks to play to start it then you pay

425
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,360
monthly subscription

426
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,220
and then this bundle this is extremely

427
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,440
cool oh do you want heated seats yes or

428
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,280
no

429
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,900
so you know you are no longer in control

430
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,700
of your own car

431
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,679
so it depends on Safety and Security

432
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,260
that is implemented in Cloud

433
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,660
and this cloud is not implemented by

434
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,820
some I.T expert but by Automotive

435
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,860
companies

436
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,480
not again

437
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,900
I said many many bad ideas are piling up

438
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,419
so far

439
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,539
so and we did a lot of testing of this

440
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,520
kind of devices and I can tell you my

441
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,740
car doesn't have buttons

442
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,220
my car has OBD Port clipped

443
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,480
and I suggest be careful with a lot of

444
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,640
buttons

445
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,700
and next and probably most important

446
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,799
topic that you already touch are Smart

447
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,240
Homes

448
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,580
so right now

449
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,160
it is possible to automate everything in

450
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,460
your home so when you go and buy a

451
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,419
heater for a water if you go to buy uh

452
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,059
AC device or you go to buy your

453
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,940
refrigerator there is a big chance that

454
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,039
there will be Wi-Fi connectivity

455
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,620
it will be connected to Cloud because

456
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,840
yeah we live in Iraq of connected

457
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,039
devices why so we can see and set up our

458
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,020
AC device when we are outside of home

459
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,000
using application around very secure

460
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,260
phone

461
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,860
to make it okay cool to 25 degrees

462
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,000
because it's so difficult when you are

463
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,700
in the house to click the button

464
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,059
and we allow our devices to speak to the

465
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:27,840
internet

466
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,020
and these devices can do interesting

467
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,580
stuff so there was

468
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,380
less than a year ago there was a big

469
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,400
problem because one of the manufacturer

470
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,380
manufacturers try to update the firmware

471
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,080
on microwave ovens and they all stopped

472
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,700
working

473
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,100
my first question why would microwave

474
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,860
ovens up be updating firmware so do they

475
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,360
have new develop new feature for it

476
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,299
because it's microwave oven

477
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,760
but they did it so it needed to be

478
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,000
connected to Internet obviously so your

479
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,860
microwave is connected to Internet for

480
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,660
one reason maybe it's tweeting right now

481
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,760
while you're sitting here

482
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,220
and it's updating its favor and by some

483
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,919
mistake of somebody we don't know who

484
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,960
was it it was it's just somebody who was

485
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,900
tired or it was sentient AI

486
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,080
so they applied wrong updates for

487
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,240
another device so our microwave started

488
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,660
having identity identity crisis and it's

489
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,299
not it's team oven

490
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,520
excellent

491
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,100
and this is just one example

492
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,760
so a lot of devices are connected and

493
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,440
smart so our TVs

494
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,940
also

495
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,160
and our TVs are really powerful devices

496
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,140
because they sometimes have even cameras

497
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,600
microphone and they can do a lot more

498
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,700
than just show you a picture of the

499
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,200
program that is currently being sent

500
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,660
also we had recently problem with garage

501
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,799
doors

502
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,200
so there was manufacturer who decided oh

503
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,760
we are no longer supporting our old

504
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,380
garage doors

505
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,020
and people lost all ability to open

506
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,280
their garage doors because everything

507
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,440
depends on cloud and this manufacturer

508
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,820
disabled cloud services

509
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,160
so I did also recently I have done some

510
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,440
research with my good friend who is very

511
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,600
commonly here with me but this year he

512
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,220
skipped and I was really hoping that he

513
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,980
will show that research also so we have

514
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,500
done some research on a baby camera he

515
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,679
got maybe a few months ago and he bought

516
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,260
some cameras to monitor his baby and we

517
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,679
did a lot of checking of these devices

518
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,480
and we found a real interesting thing

519
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,100
but I will keep that for our next

520
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,620
balcony so we'll go into more details

521
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,080
together

522
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,960
and the problem is who has control of

523
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,059
our device

524
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:50,580
it's not us it's cloud provider

525
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,100
it's whoever controls connectivity

526
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,140
services for our device being smart home

527
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,640
being cars ACS we are not solely in

528
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,659
control

529
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,480
so we we even have those smart

530
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,500
assistants Alexa or or

531
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,620
or Google or whatever

532
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,340
and we want to give them voice commands

533
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,500
and we allow these services to connect

534
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,299
to other services so they can control

535
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,400
them

536
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,400
so as I said a lot of fun and problems

537
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,460
are every everywhere and to be honest

538
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,760
it's not so easy to solve these problems

539
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,880
so what is the root cause of most

540
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,880
security issues in Hardware

541
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,400
it doesn't just impact these simple

542
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,799
devices but this spans over more

543
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,780
critical infrastructure so this funds

544
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,480
were energy manufacturing energy

545
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,659
distribution water treatment so

546
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,720
everything that lived in isolation for

547
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,400
so many years

548
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,880
we had I.T world and we had world of

549
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,380
devices and they were two separate roles

550
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,340
so to implement Security in devices it

551
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,260
was enough to make sure that nobody can

552
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,700
enter your building

553
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,480
but but lately as I showed we started to

554
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,700
implement connectivity and features and

555
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,580
we started to collide those two words

556
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,340
and all the worlds are colliding people

557
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,580
are not following so we still have it

558
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,659
experts who are not electrical engineers

559
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:30,419
so most of the Security Experts comes

560
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:31,980
from computer science

561
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,480
and in computer science you don't need

562
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,039
to have even basic of electoral

563
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,140
techniques

564
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,059
and on the other side you have engineers

565
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,120
and their manufacturing mindset which is

566
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,159
not always aligned with best security

567
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,900
practices

568
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,000
and it's very common that they do not

569
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,679
even speak the same language although

570
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,840
all technical features but they cannot

571
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,580
understand each other because they have

572
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,320
completely different View

573
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,059
in one engineer is focused on design on

574
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:02,460
operation not on security

575
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,620
while security doesn't concern always

576
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,140
about functionality but we need to have

577
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,340
controls

578
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,919
and those two rules are now colliding

579
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,559
and we need to start developing skills

580
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,740
in in both fields so it's not always

581
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,559
easy it but it's always fun

582
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,039
so

583
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,539
why it is fun

584
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:27,240
I always say to my guys you cannot learn

585
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,500
to hack

586
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,320
no way but you have to learn

587
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,960
so you will need to start doing stuff in

588
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,580
order to learn how they operate to

589
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,620
understand them we need to make mistakes

590
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,400
we need to destroy stuff in order to get

591
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,960
how they actually functioning and what

592
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,880
they actually can do

593
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,960
so I will show you a few things just to

594
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,000
entice your imagination and I hope this

595
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,700
will inspire you to actually try to get

596
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,980
your hands dirty and to start opening

597
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,780
your devices

598
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,360
and to see what you can do to make them

599
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,820
more secure and different so I will I

600
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,520
will show you uh this is ongoing project

601
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,740
that I'm doing right now so I started

602
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,020
recently so I didn't go very far with it

603
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,960
but I think it will be good as a

604
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,860
beginner

605
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,520
uh uh beginner demo so what you need to

606
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,380
do in order to start so

607
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,080
first thing that you need to start is to

608
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,000
open device

609
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,900
so and to do visual inspection of it

610
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,900
try to find easy targets are there any

611
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,559
flash cards SD cards inside it are there

612
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,600
memory chips which are isolated flash

613
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,080
chips something that you can connect and

614
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,740
maybe access the data

615
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,039
uh also try to find interesting points

616
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,919
on PCB that you can do something with

617
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,679
good source of information is FCC number

618
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,860
so if if device has any kind of Wireless

619
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,260
connectivity and if it is sold on U.S

620
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,900
market it must have FCC number and it is

621
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,580
already in database when you can search

622
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,799
it and discover a lot of design

623
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,980
information about device itself

624
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,900
so that's extremely good source of

625
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,400
information to start with and of course

626
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,100
your eyes so you open device you'll you

627
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,020
thoroughly look it so both sides of the

628
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,659
board and try to find interesting points

629
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:20,580
what are interesting point that you can

630
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:25,760
connect and extract data we need data

631
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,919
so here I have identified many many

632
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,460
ports which are not populated mostly

633
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,860
but when I check the traces I found that

634
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,500
this port these two rows are actually

635
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,200
connected to nearby components here and

636
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,020
I think here if I see correctly

637
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,020
and they are not dead

638
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,299
so of course I didn't check only those

639
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,520
two I have done a lot of tracks so it

640
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,440
sounded to be easy five minute draw but

641
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,659
it's not so you need to search every

642
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:57,360
single possible Trace to see every every

643
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,120
point and to try to identify what this

644
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,880
is connected to and how you can use it

645
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,700
or misuse it and good thing

646
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,820
he's a lot of stuff you can do without

647
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,860
powering on device but in the end you

648
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,539
need to power device on

649
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,120
so in order to power device you need

650
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,940
first to to have proper connectors so

651
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,260
you can connect

652
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,299
to device if you only don't have power

653
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,400
connector in the in this case I didn't

654
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,220
have it because it was not available on

655
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,559
this device but it was very helpful that

656
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,100
on the front bezel of device I had

657
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,039
that it is 12 volt DC so the only thing

658
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,020
remaining was to discover what is the

659
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,440
polarity of the power connector here and

660
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,240
it is simple just checking continuity

661
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,940
between pins and known ground you can

662
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,279
discover where is the ground pin and by

663
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,580
definition the other one is a plus so

664
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,220
that gives you ability to power a device

665
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,919
and actually I have succeeded so I get

666
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,980
green light and it was also red light

667
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,419
because device could not connect

668
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:04,140
whatever it was searching to connect

669
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,419
and after powering device we do

670
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,760
measurement so we need to do a lot of

671
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,520
measurements to to try to see if there

672
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,340
are any Live Connections so live traces

673
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,919
where something is happening and then we

674
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:18,900
need to analyze what is happening and if

675
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,120
that is of any use for us

676
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,580
so on that Port that I mentioned

677
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,740
originally I have identified the two

678
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,380
connections are ground but one of those

679
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,480
connections for showing interesting

680
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,240
signal and it was only when it was power

681
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,320
done

682
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,840
so not all the time but on power on I

683
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,260
would see activity on that PIN

684
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,620
and when I connected later to that pin I

685
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,600
I got this

686
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,220
login Pro

687
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,960
so this is excellent results so we

688
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
finally have a way to interact with

689
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,900
harder which is not available to normal

690
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,900
user but it requires login

691
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,700
and this is where I had to stop because

692
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,640
I had to come to Balkan

693
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,559
but it doesn't prevent people to tell

694
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,059
you what are my next steps for this

695
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:11,279
so first is I I want to tamper with boot

696
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,640
process so during the if I'm corrected

697
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,679
in time and I can see boot process I can

698
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:19,140
see that there is a loader which

699
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,299
actually do some stuff and in some cases

700
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,340
it's possible to interact with that you

701
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,080
can redirect it for example that not

702
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,960
load the image from the flash memory in

703
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,039
device but to use tftp or I can do if

704
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,320
there is a Linux I can put put it in in

705
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,960
it one maybe or some other way to gain

706
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,940
control of booting process because that

707
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,340
will give might give me access to

708
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,799
console which I can use to to go further

709
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,659
to the device another thing is to try

710
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,059
brute forcing root login so by using

711
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:51,960
device like this called TTL to USB so I

712
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,240
could it is serial port on your machine

713
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,919
when it's connected and you can use

714
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,840
Simple Python scripts in order to

715
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,779
automate brute forcing of logins

716
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:03,240
and the third thing that can be done in

717
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,460
this case is time analysis so whenever

718
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,720
you

719
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,340
put

720
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,279
strings in something and they are

721
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,020
verified there must be some mathematical

722
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,419
operations and if this process is not

723
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,340
done perfectly

724
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,580
it is possible that you can see timing

725
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,340
differences so if I start typing wrong

726
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,039
passwords and it matches only first for

727
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,799
example only lengths is checked first it

728
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,740
will exit much sooner if it is wrong

729
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,020
length of the string then it's right

730
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:38,700
then if I finally discovered what is the

731
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,320
right length and I put first letter

732
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,899
properly it will be

733
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:45,960
quicker or slower depending on the

734
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,539
situation so you can do a lot of time

735
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:52,799
analysis by putting uh new uh repeat

736
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,840
repeating the same inputs and then

737
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,539
Gathering like average of response and

738
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:58,980
then you will see okay when I put first

739
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,960
letter A I get response of 80

740
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,899
microseconds if I put letter Z it gives

741
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:07,140
me 200 microseconds and all of them are

742
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,899
under 100 so Z is something special so

743
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,059
it might be our first letter or not

744
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:14,940
why because when it compared string it

745
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,279
it used some more primitive process and

746
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,860
it compare one letter by one letter and

747
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,080
he decided the first letter then it is

748
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,700
matching and start processing another

749
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,640
letter so it took additional time

750
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,220
if it is wrong letter it discovers that

751
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,080
it is wrong on first letter and falls

752
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,700
through immediately

753
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,980
so timing attacks are also interesting

754
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,140
it's not always possible of course so it

755
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,480
depends on implementation but luckily

756
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,460
developers are really really really

757
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,620
smart richers and they want to invent

758
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,140
their own algorithms instead of using

759
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,580
what is industry standards and that

760
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,899
gives us opportunity for different

761
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:51,559
attacks

762
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,600
also there are other options so trying

763
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,740
to get to the firmware any other way by

764
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,679
finding update or by glitching so fault

765
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,700
injection

766
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,980
or something new who might know we might

767
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,840
invent something so I had a colleague of

768
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,779
mine who found a way in some specific

769
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,940
series of microcontrollers to dump the

770
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,260
firmware by misusing uh USB stack so by

771
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,559
just connecting to USB port of device he

772
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,659
was able to find a way

773
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:23,880
and to finish to to

774
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,779
dump the filter very soon and quickly

775
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,980
so

776
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,500
I think this is all that I wanted to

777
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,840
show

778
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,880
thank you all and if there are any

779
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,120
questions

780
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:43,200
wait please wait for

781
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,299
when you do timing attacks do you do

782
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,919
them on a computer or do you implement

783
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:48,659
them on embedded Hardware too just to

784
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:51,179
have more control over timings yes I use

785
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:57,679
fpga usually to create my own thing okay

786
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,960
what does the device do initially I mean

787
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,880
what the

788
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,860
what it should do Based On A lender I

789
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,539
cannot disclose that okay

790
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,740
foreign

791
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,820
so sometimes Communications within the

792
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,640
devices are usually the encrypted or

793
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,980
have some maybe some sort of encryption

794
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,440
usually sucks but sometimes it happens

795
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,120
not just like how would you deal like

796
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,740
when you have you either extract a

797
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,039
firmware that is encrypted or the data

798
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,600
in transit that you can capture is

799
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,600
encrypted how can you find out how is it

800
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,179
and how to break it yeah not so easy so

801
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:47,279
first we try to find unencrypted

802
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,200
Communications there are a lot of ports

803
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,240
that you can use like SPI which is

804
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,460
usually not encrypted so you try to find

805
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,260
something that is not encrypted other

806
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,419
options try to attack memories itself

807
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,340
because in memory it is usually not

808
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,500
encrypted but if everything else fails

809
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,140
and you need to deal with cryptography

810
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,159
you have few ways one is to do uh

811
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,639
the power analysis to try to guess what

812
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,560
device is doing but that's really not

813
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,780
easy other ways to try what we call

814
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,260
unknown protocol analysis so and also

815
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,359
that FCC documentation that I mentioned

816
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,460
can be really useful into deducing what

817
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,440
device actually use for encryption if it

818
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,679
is communication Channel and that can

819
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,639
help

820
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,179
now

821
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,339
here

822
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,560
hi I have a more philosophical question

823
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,480
in the first half you said that cloud

824
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,339
providers or cloud is controlling our

825
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:48,859
devices

826
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:51,179
since we all know that human are the

827
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,300
weakest link do we and we are rapidly

828
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,060
going towards the idiocracy style of

829
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,380
gamification of everything

830
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,140
can we expect from a common ordinary Joe

831
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,400
to know how to control its own device

832
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,599
that's never happened they're going to

833
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,640
happen so when you know there was a long

834
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,820
process of creating idiot-proof devices

835
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,099
and whenever they manage to do it

836
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:20,460
somebody else managed to enhance idiot

837
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,280
so it's not joke so like 50 years ago

838
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,099
your car came with manual would say how

839
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,859
to tune your vowels exactly now it's

840
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:30,480
written to not drink your acid from

841
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,859
bakuma later

842
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:34,619
so we are not getting smarter for sure

843
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:36,900
and as soon as we have that AI gain

844
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,240
control of those guns that we saw you

845
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,300
will be removed as we are we're told

846
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,880
sister we are toasted we are worthless

847
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,800
part we just consume energy and we

848
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,560
contribute nothing just stupidity

849
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,940
maybe we should provide it

850
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,160
yeah thanks for the talk it was

851
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,500
interesting uh I wanted to ask have you

852
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,260
ever tried uh reversing uh some

853
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,960
extracted firmware and have you ever

854
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,380
tried replacing uh firmware on a device

855
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,599
many times

856
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:17,540
yeah uh cool and uh

857
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,619
how complicated was that I mean

858
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:25,579
was it something like uh replacing a

859
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:29,520
firmware like on a router or it was less

860
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,520
complicated it depends so it depends of

861
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,800
the device sometimes you have om version

862
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,079
of device so there are many of the same

863
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,420
they just have some specifics for

864
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,640
specific manufacturer in that case we

865
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,680
might be able to use pyramid from

866
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,619
another manufacturer which might not

867
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:48,180
have all the Safety and Security

868
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,520
implemented so it will give us something

869
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,500
or we can use older version of firmware

870
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,859
which have known issues and that will

871
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:59,760
give us access uh for some devices if

872
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,220
they're running something like Android

873
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,680
we might be even try to compile Android

874
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,140
open source project in order to make

875
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,720
device work but that of course is not so

876
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,160
simple because sometimes you need to

877
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,220
bypass a bootloader signatures and stuff

878
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,140
like that so there are some features

879
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,760
that we need to bypass but it is not

880
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,920
impossible

881
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,640
thank you

882
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,520
thank you thank you for the talk

883
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,460
interesting topic really and it reminded

884
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,300
me uh some some time ago that I heard

885
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,380
another talk at the topic of

886
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,240
undocumented Hardware

887
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,020
um

888
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,780
uh harder commands regarding CPUs and

889
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,640
that that may be used for back during

890
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,520
the the device that software doesn't

891
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,880
recognize uh were you in your career

892
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,000
being able to find such undocumented

893
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,440
commands that were not in the

894
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,320
specification many times so that is not

895
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,599
so uncommon this is why we actually do

896
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,460
if you recall that I mentioned that we

897
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,619
need to read

898
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:15,960
manufacturer documentation about actual

899
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,359
chips implemented because when they are

900
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,760
implemented you will get just user

901
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,280
manual for it but manufacturer will give

902
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,859
much more detailed description of the

903
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:29,040
chip itself and then you can discover a

904
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,920
lot about keeper actual capabilities not

905
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,839
what is advertised but what is actually

906
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,359
under the hood and also it is always

907
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:39,060
good to to perform these checks of the

908
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,339
PCB because you can discover stuff like

909
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:43,680
this uart which was not mentioned

910
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,420
anywhere in user documentation it should

911
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,420
not be a this thing and also we saw that

912
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,119
manufacturers do really bad things when

913
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,300
such vulnerabilities are reported so we

914
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,000
were once doing some some engagement and

915
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,160
we reported that we have found debug

916
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,980
port on the board did you say yes sure

917
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,480
no problem we will sell it out and what

918
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,920
they did they just removed the port the

919
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,079
soldered it but they still had PCB

920
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,180
traces for the love of God

921
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,920
it's just three minutes to get back to

922
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,720
it

923
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,400
what are your thoughts about open

924
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,020
sourcing Hardware

925
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,480
uh that is actually really good because

926
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,300
uh hope you know we are all open for

927
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,400
open source so it gives much more

928
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,640
chances for everybody else to contribute

929
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,640
and to check security of devices they

930
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,800
are using are everybody able to do that

931
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,020
I'm not I would not bet on it but at

932
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,280
least there will be much more people

933
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,260
than now so who is now checking source

934
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,619
code of manufacturers

935
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:42,240
nobody so at least you will have chance

936
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,700
to to do something on under your own

937
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,339
terms are you good or not good that is

938
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:49,440
to be seen but you will have a chance

939
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,960
now you don't have any chance

940
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,220
yeah thank you

941
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:06,060
hi uh so you mentioned uh bypassing uh a

942
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,700
bootloader's signature protection uh

943
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,900
could you go into a bit more detail

944
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,260
about that

945
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,859
how do you I'm assuming it has a hash

946
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:19,140
that is calculated uh the image that it

947
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,720
loads so you need to match that hash

948
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,599
right okay so what you use like nice

949
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,119
cache or some other service that then

950
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,460
how do you add what is net necessary to

951
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,040
produce such cache yeah so it's really

952
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,720
complicated matter and it would take at

953
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,260
least two terms of of presentation like

954
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,740
this but in in a nutshell uh we in

955
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,780
theory it works perfectly in practice

956
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,400
there is always something that is not

957
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,440
implemented as it should

958
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,920
so something is missing somewhere

959
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,079
so you you need to have trusted bootload

960
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,240
it must start from the first

961
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,220
step so you need to have some secure

962
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,300
element inside your uh CPU in order to

963
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,820
be able to pull initial secret that you

964
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,040
will use for the later steps and that is

965
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,720
something that is sometimes not

966
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,060
implemented properly or not implemented

967
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,220
at all so they just trust one of the

968
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,619
steps blindly and then continue so we

969
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:15,720
attack weakest link so to be honest I

970
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,480
will not attack cryptography by default

971
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,880
it's waste of time usually if it's done

972
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,760
properly but I said developers are

973
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,680
really smart people and like challenge

974
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,920
to develop something new and better and

975
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,040
they fail 100 of the time

976
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,900
so

977
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,320
uh so this is all the time we have for

978
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,500
questions uh we need to get moving so if

979
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,760
anyone has any more questions please

980
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,800
feel welcome to approach uh well then

981
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,330
after the presentation thank you

982
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:51,970
[Applause]

983
00:41:51,970 --> 00:42:05,078
[Music]

984
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:13,500
[Music]

985
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,220
thank you
