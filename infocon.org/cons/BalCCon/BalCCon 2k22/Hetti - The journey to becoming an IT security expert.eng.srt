so welcome to my talk the journey to

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,460
becoming a tea security expert

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,340
um first who am I so I have a Swiss

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,899
admin background I'm doing it already

17
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,640
for several years since I've been in

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,579
various companies and in the metal

19
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,780
Rackspace I have 10 years of Academia in

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,479
Academia I studied for already for 10

21
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:10,560
years

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,780
um I wouldn't wouldn't really recommend

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,540
it that you started so long for bachelor

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,840
and master together but while happened

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,759
I'm already also doing capture the flags

26

questions in the end please also wait

38
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,399
for the microphone that to get it before

39
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,360
asking a question and these slides will

40
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,119
also be uploaded online to the pre-talk

41
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,040
system so you can just download the

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,600
slides and with all the links inside you

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,280
don't you don't need to to make pictures

44
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,899
you can download just the slides later

45
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,579
with all the links inside

46
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,520
so the first thing is a disclaimer uh

47
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,560
this talk represents my own experience

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,680
uh it's their personal recommendations

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,160
paths can be different you can come you

50
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,780
can join this field in different ways

51
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,720
with different paths and later some

52
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,120
parts we have a bigger focus on

53
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,680
offensive security because that's my

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,000
background

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,220
so first of all why this talk

56
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,220
um it security is very popular and there

57
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,940
are also a lot of different

58
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,879
specializations and challenges and

59
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,440
especially as a beginner it's really

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,260
hard to choose where to start what

61
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,180
should I do what I should pursue what

62
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,519
what it is to study or whatever

63
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,379
and it's also hard to distinguish what

64
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:47,819
are good options because there's so much

65
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,800
possibilities there are like tutorials

66
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,680
there are studies there are job

67
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,099
opportunities like where should I start

68
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,920
um therefore I would first show my own

69
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,519
path what I did where what to do and

70
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,280
what you could do in your future to get

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,540
into this field

72
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,879
so as I said I have Academia background

73
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,360
I started 2012 on the technical computer

74
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,099
science study at Technical University of

75
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,459
Vienna and uh I started like for seven

76
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,040
years uh my bachelor and there were like

77
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,540
two hard courses on the electric

78
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,940
engineering faculty and I already tried

79
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,980
it one or two times and failed and then

80
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,260
I had this genius idea there is uh there

81
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,300
is the University law that you can have

82
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,580
your own study like you put yourself

83
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,620
your own courses you make a

84
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,659
qualification profile and you hand it in

85
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,640
if it gets authorized you can have this

86
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,760
individual study so I I I made this

87
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,159
individual study I kicked out those two

88
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,159
courses and I named it computer security

89
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,959
engineering so I put a lot of activity

90
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,360
security into my courses and it got it

91
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,599
got approved and I finished this this

92
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,840
bachelor in 2020

93
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,340
so that was my life hack for my

94
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,819
University this this this this year and

95
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,640
then uh I said well I have now eight

96
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,819
years of of University in Vienna and I

97
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,040
would like to start to work and because

98
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,680
the master is uh

99
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
is a full-time master so I said okay

100
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,358
let's go to the effort technical it's

101
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,399
like a more applied University and now

102
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,199
they offered a

103
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,380
that you can study part-time so I worked

104
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,440
for 30 30 hours per per week and

105
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,000
starting the evening like I had like

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,160
Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday in the

107
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,560
evening I had my my study there and

108
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,240
studied that in the evening

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,120
and I did it for I finished really fast

110
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,220
like in two years I did my master after

111
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,720
eight years of Bachelor and

112
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,660
and uh also my my master thesis was

113
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,520
automated deployment fishing

114
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,500
infrastructures like just roll out

115
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,600
fishing instruction 15 minutes and then

116
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,300
make your fishing campaigns

117
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,500
so during I mean I of besides going to

118
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,300
conferences during my bachelor I also

119
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,520
worked a little bit so first I started

120
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,560
so I T all rounder for one and a half

121
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,419
years like doing all that tea stuff just

122
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,820

consulting company

124

and afterwards it was for three and a

125
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,400
half year uh Swiss admin at the

126

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,020
Institute I also was lecturer for us

128
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,880
University course where I in the end

129
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,039
teached about ransomware maybe you

130
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,139
remember my ransomware talk and then I

131
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,060
did this talk as a course for for

132
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,639
interested people I had some internships

133
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,400
at some companies and had there's some

134
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,800
experience and I've also since over five

135
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,139
years of volunteering since I'm in meta

136
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,400
lab and doing the whole infrastructure

137
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,100
with a colleague there

138
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,380
um after this it work uh and when I

139
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,780
finished my my bachelor I got the

140
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,060
opportunity to start sit security

141
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,800
professional

142
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,539
um so I worked for two years as a

143
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,520
teacher expert and I did mainly

144
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,699
penetration testing uh web apps networks

145
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,340
apps iOS Android I also did some light

146
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,520
red teaming assessment very like had a

147
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,800

153
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,940
some security Consulting like they need

154
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,860

help them

156
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,160
so that was like my entry into the I.T

157
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,460

party Vienna where I like teach people

162
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,979
basic I.T security stuff uh in my free

00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,960
time there is privacy week or also

164

helping out and also you get so if you

170
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,380
volunteer we get known to speakers and

171
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,660
we have a network and can can get known

172
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,639
to nice people and I also do customer

173
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,280
it's a really nice project from Germany

174
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,919
which always in Austria too so we go to

175
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,680
schools voluntarily and we teach the

176
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,080
children media competence like we tell

177
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,560
them why are social medias free and why

178
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,960
are probably dangerous or not as free as

179
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,880
you think and otherwise you'd have

180
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,039
proper passwords so and whatever and we

181
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,660
always discussed with the people like

182
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,419
what are secure Messengers why is

183
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,220
Snapchat not really the best thing and

184
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,080
that they don't don't really delete your

185
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,039
messages

186
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,520
and so we try to to teach the children

187
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,280
some basic media competence that they

188
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,680
can in the future watch watch out for

189
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,919
for their digital usage

190
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,060
so first of all that was like my path in

191
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,780
in this field so let's start with I.T

192
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,180
Security in general like it's a super

193
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,740
broad field you have a lot of

194
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,020
specializations you can you can do a fan

195
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,580
of security like I did like penetration

196
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,860
testing red teaming you can go to the

197
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,380
defensive field like you can do system

198
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,620
hardening monitoring sock is system

199
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,599
um secure Operation Center where you

200
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,940
like analyze incidents you can do blue

201
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,280
teaming and and what and defend the

202
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,259
network you can do incident response

203
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,880
like when hits the fan maybe you

204
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,800
heard yesterday the talk from the Greek

205
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,000
guy and from from Sandra and of course

206
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,560
there is also this field of information

207
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,440
security management system it's not my I

208
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,599
don't really like it but it's like more

209
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,339
theoretical and setting up the system

210
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,380
but in the end you need also Management

211
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,860
Systems to manage the the dangers of of

212
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,440
incidents and of I.T problems and you

213
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,539
can also do it security architecture and

214
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,880
many many more fields so it's it's

215
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,320
really interesting and you can really

216
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,019
choose what you're interested in

217
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,040
and let's start first with like maybe

218
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,080
you know what's what's happening I.T

219
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,720
security but I would like to have a

220
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,160
small

221
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,740
small

222
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,899
guide like how I see the I.T security

223
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,480
daily life or how I how I how it

224
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,339
happened so the first thing is you

225
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,200
probably know this is fine you're

226
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,640
working there and everything's burning

227
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,160
and you need to fix it somehow

228
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,399
um that's often the case and I mean you

229
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,320
sometimes get used to it but it's still

230
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,279
like

231
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,200
it shouldn't be like that

232
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,220
and of course you also know when it's

233
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,300
like that then the next slide is also of

234
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,640
course the follow-up like it's not

235
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,140
stressful at all

236
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,019
but you get quite old if you're like

237
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,260
really stressed all the time

238
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,440
and if you're stressed and you have a

239
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,019
lot of stuff to do then also this can

240
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,200
happen like you did what like I don't

241
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,940
know you're doing some stuff and it was

242
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,519
you you turned off the server while the

243
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,320
incident was there like all the memories

244
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,740
away man you did what or what

245
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,640
um

246
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,640
you deleted this file share whatever so

247
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,620
there you can make you can make mistakes

248
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,560
and then sometimes it's you're not it's

249
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,240
not possible to recover from this those

250
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,580
mistakes I mean you learn for the future

251
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,580
but yes that's also one thing like

252
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,440
stuff can happen

253
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,140
another thing is

254
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,240
that's you're probably gonna gonna gonna

255
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,880
know that situation like if if you need

256
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,420
to do something and then every points to

257
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,980
the other person and you're like running

258
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,380
around and don't know who is now the

259
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,820
responsible person and they are going to

260
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,440
the other one go to City owner the

261
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,320
internet is the Seesaw so this is like

262
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,959
you need to go around and find the right

263
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,880
person that you can discuss stuff

264
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,459
um and it's sometimes tedious and it's

265
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,800
sometimes hard and it shouldn't be like

266
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,899
that but it's often the case that you

267
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,180
really need to a long time until you get

268
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,880
the stuff you need for your work and so

269
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,740
sometimes just people quit because of

270
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,940
this because it's I don't want to to do

271
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,899
that

272
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,760
and

273
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,440
um another problem or solution it's how

274
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,060
you see it like

275
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,820
you have a problem there is a proper

276
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,980
solution but the people just do a quick

277
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,320
fix like it should work for some time

278
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,040
and then the Quick Fix Works forever or

279
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,820
like at some point just breaks

280
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,040
and this happens a lot and also happened

281
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,519
in my in my career also sometimes that

282
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,980
we had just

283
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,300
deployed a quick fix because we didn't

284
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,740
have some time and

285
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,959
some quick fixes at the metal are still

286
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,480
existing and we still want to replace

287
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,399
them by proper Solutions but currently

288
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,420
no time but we're gonna gonna come there

289
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,079
um

290
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,920
and for this for this problem there is a

291
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,440
specific root cause and that's like

292
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,959
often you're not have a proper time

293
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,660
frame for projects so you have you don't

294
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,820
get enough times to solve this you don't

295
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,560
get enough time to solve the problem

296
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,720
there like if only a project for one

297
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,420
week but realistically with like two or

298
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,640
three weeks and it's a big problem that

299
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,339
I often encounter that you get less to

300
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,800
wait time to solve the problems and then

301
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,100
you make some quick fixes whatever and

302
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,560
often you're like not not satisfied with

303
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,779
the outcome but you need to go on to the

304
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,120
next project and that's also a problem

305
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,160
often that you don't get just enough

306
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,040
time to do it properly

307
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,880
um

308
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,100
another another

309
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,079
challenge is that in it security

310
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,920
especially in a t-security you're

311
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,420
competing with the whole world like

312
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,040
there are a lot of people you can work

313
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,339
online or you can work remotely and

314
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,440
there are a lot of talented people out

315
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,079
there that are also want to be the best

316
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:58,320
and want to offer a service or uh or

317
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,000
want a job in a t security field so

318
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,560
you're competing with the whole world so

319
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,240
you need to be on track and also life

320
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,180
lifelong learning and keep updated all

321
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,339
the time because its security is a

322
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,200
really fast changing world and you

323
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,880
really need to be up to be updating your

324
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,279
knowledge all the time and as I already

325
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,740
said upting the knowledge regularly

326
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,260
you need to learn you need to to write

327
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,560
maybe some exams you need to set up some

328
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,480
Labs you need to watch some tutorials

329
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,139
read some books so it's really

330
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,480
um you need it's it's a quite a lot of

331
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,740
effort to to be up to date and

332
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,260
but in the end it's quite a reward if

333
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,240
you like get some new news and you can

334
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,279
maybe test some proof of concept code

335
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,740
set up our lab and and Tinker around so

336
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,620
it's also quite a cool thing to

337
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,800
and one important thing maybe you saw

338
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,680
the the talk yesterday from Nicos about

339
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,160
insulin response like it can happen that

340
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,680
it's like Friday and a client calls it

341
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,720
hey we just have an incident Karen

342
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,519
please come and fix the stuff and make

343
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,579
instant response so your whole weekend

344
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:11,579
plans to change and this is I mean it

345
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,380
depends on the artistic job you do but

346
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,180
they are quite some where you say okay I

347
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,680
need to pack my stuff I need to go into

348
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,779
the into the plane and fly to some

349
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,320
customer and fix the stuff so this other

350
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,959
thing that can happen that you have no

351
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,760
proper weekend plans because it can

352
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,459
change just in a second

353
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:32,399
and of course

354
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,579
um after such weekend you look like this

355
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:38,399
and you like or like yes like I did

356
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,079
today in the morning of the karaoke

357
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,459
party

358
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:42,899
and

359
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,360
um so it can also be really really hard

360
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,880
like working all weekend and doing an

361
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,440
incident and then like just come home

362
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,959
and just sleep for for one day

363
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,920
but better like the the hard or bad

364
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,800
things about active security but the

365
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,920
thing is I don't want only tell you bad

366
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,480
things about the secret is this it

367
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,940
security I also want to tell at least

368
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,160
three good things I think are in I.T

369
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,620
security important so the the first

370
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,820
thing is

371
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,660
um

372
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,360
so with it security you can have a

373
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,699
really positive impact in the in the I.T

374
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,339
world in the world in general you can

375
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:23,160
you can defend companies you can defend

376
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,320
your the private data of a lot of people

377
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,639
you can

378
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,459
you can Implement proper systems

379
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,399
um so you you can improve

380
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,060
accessibility to Services you can teach

381
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,160
people how to watch out awareness

382
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,680
trainings so you can have really proper

383
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,320
impact and help the whole society with

384
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,660
your work and I I think that's a really

385
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,760
nice thing that you can do with your

386
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,160
time and your effort

387
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,940
another thing is during this this whole

388
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,800
point of impact thing you have also a

389
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,579
lot of

390
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,320
challenges awaiting you there are a lot

391
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,180
of interesting challenges out there that

392
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,620
you can

393
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,899
um start and work on like there are a

394
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,880
lot of different fields as already said

395
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,980
and they have all different challenges

396
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,160
and so it's interesting and you can have

397
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,720
a lot of fun there I mean sometimes

398
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,860
you're going to sit there for five hours

399
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,839
and debugging some stuff but if you

400
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,220
imagine you're super happy and it's

401
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,959
super nice and you say yeah I did the

402
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,639
cool stuff and it's working now

403
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,579
and this was one motivation of me that's

404
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,380
quite challenging and I like this

405
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,639
challenge

406
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,279
and I mean and the last and the last

407
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,880
motivation I can tell you is like uh

408
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,120
I mean you earn quite good in it

409
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,100
security and

410
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,120
um

411
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,860
I mean I said you have some some some

412
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,079
some

413
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,019
bad things but you get properly paid in

414
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,420
this field and uh that's quite some

415
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,060
positive thing good thing

416
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,720
so I I made a list for like what I think

417
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,779
are prerequisites for I.T security

418
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,880
so the first thing is you should have

419
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,800
some curiosity for problem solving like

420
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,600
you want to tackle problems and solve

421
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,819
them that's like one really important

422
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,699
prerequisite on my in my opinion

423
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,760
also you need a broad foundational I.T

424
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,179
knowledge uh because it Securities in my

425
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,299
opinion is not an entry job you should

426
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,540
already need some knowledge in the I.T

427
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,400
field like knowing how systems work

428
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,140
knowing some Concepts

429
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,480
having technical hands-on experience

430
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,179
also having the programming skills

431
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,580
of course as already said you you need

432
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,780
you're competing with the whole world

433
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,600
and everything is changing fast so you

434
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,100
also need a motivation for lifelong

435
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,020
learning

436
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,059
um and also one important skills that

437
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:45,240
often people maybe don't see is you also

438
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,799
need some soft skills because you're

439
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,260
you're you're talking with your

440
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,820
colleagues you're talking with customers

441
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,900
you maybe do awareness uh awareness

442
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,700
campaigns so you need also

443
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,240
you should manage to to to to to talk to

444
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,120
the people and and uh sell them the good

445
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,100
stuff of it security like you shouldn't

446
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,080
click every every application you

447
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,520
download from the Internet or you should

448
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,260
watch out for emails there's fishing

449
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,820
males and you should have these soft

450
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,340
skills how to to tell that the people

451
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,020
um so that's like for me they're like

452
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,940
six points that you should have as a

453
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,660
prerequisite so the question is how how

454
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,080
you can get those like some of them are

455
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,299
like okay you you have it by yourself

456
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:33,240
and somebody need to like to to get to

457
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,580
to this to this knowledge level so I

458
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,020
have like

459
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,460
um

460
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,600
five five paths I I want to show you how

461
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,000
you can uh that you can explore and can

462
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,760
get into it to get like the

463
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,220
the Baseline for the knowledge you need

464
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,720
for it security

465
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,480
so the first apprenticeship

466
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,080
um like I will go for everyone in detail

467
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,020
of course Academia as I did also I.T

468
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,260
jobs and also self-learning and ctfs and

469
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,760
yeah conference like this here like

470
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,799
coming here and talking with people and

471
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,600
listening to awesome talks and

472
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,220
discussions

473
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,900
so the first thing is

474
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,640
apprenticeship

475
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,360
um

476
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,280
like you start a job from the beginning

477
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,799
you normally have a mentor you're like

478
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,140
working for three years

479
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,059
often you don't have a good pay for

480
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,460
these three years but after the three

481
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,100
years you get quite a proper pay

482
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,919
afterwards and you have a really solid

483
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,440
I.T knowledge for that for the for the

484
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,440
I.T security start and so I think this

485
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,539
is quite a nice thing to to start with

486
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:42,299
if you like quite young and say okay I'm

487
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,760
interested in I.T security but I need

488
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,460
the I.T knowledge in the beginning so

489
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,820
start apprenticeship and wreck the three

490
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,400
years learn a lot have a mentor and then

491
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,780
then start to step into it security

492
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,280
another

493
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,120
um yeah Academia I did Academia there's

494
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,740
a lot of theory that you learn in

495
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,940
Academia that's sometimes hard but it

496
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,860
pays off because

497
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,260
um for example you learn a programming

498
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,360
language but you know the content behind

499
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,919
it so if you if you want to learn

500
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,419
another program language you already

501
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,640
know the concept so it's easier for you

502
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,880
to to use the language and also can just

503
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,940
apply the concepts and just start start

504
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,740
directly coding in the new language

505
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,179
um you get the proper good foundation

506
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,160
after your study

507
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,080
the one thing is you need minimum three

508
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,480
to five years until you're done with

509
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,340
your study and it's like minimum because

510
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,919
often you you start to work beside

511
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,600
University and you

512
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,100
take longer and often Universe like full

513
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,900
time so you don't have a lot much time

514
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,960
to work afterwards or you just like work

515
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,700
and need like the double the time or

516
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,880
depends on your on your situation

517
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,280
uh one one really good thing about

518
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,559
Academia is in my opinion you're

519
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,799
independent so you can choose yourself

520
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,240
which courses you want to do when you

521
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,740
want to do it when you want to do the

522
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,960
exam and you also learn some

523
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,780
self-management like when do I want to

524
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,640
to

525
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,340
to make this course

526
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,380
um check out what I'm what I'm planning

527
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,539
to do so you in the in the end you're

528
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:27,120
improving your management and it's quite

529
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,640
a nice soft skill to have later for life

530
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,640
and of course friends for life I have I

531
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,260
have still friends that I at a meeting

532
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,299
with I'm I was traveling with them

533
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,000
around I of course learned with them

534
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,280
together but I'm also going with them

535
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,960
and partying and it's really really

536
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,280
great friends that I learned in

537
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,799
University get known to them

538
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,280
I also have one Academia bonus slide

539
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,799
it's a really important recommendation

540
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,400
by from myself so do not postpone your

541
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,679
math exam after you did the exercise

542
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,080
course until the end of their study

543
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,659
because being there done that it's pain

544
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:06,900
in the ass please I don't recommend that

545
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,200
and another another information I will

546
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,419
recommend you if you go to university

547
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:14,039
find some people some groups some

548
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,960
friends and study with them together

549
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,059
because if you're on your own as like a

550
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:19,080
lone wolf

551
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,840
you will probably stop because like you

552
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,640
don't have energy anymore or you're

553
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,320
getting troubles but with a group you

554
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,179
can sit down you can learn together you

555
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,799
can go and drinking something party

556
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,200
afterwards and it's much much easier to

557
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,380
to study with a group of people

558
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,520
so some recommendations for jobs for to

559
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,380
to gain the basic knowledge

560
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,620
so one is like it help desk

561
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,140
um because it's also a good thing to

562
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,179
improve your soft skills because you're

563
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:49,860
interacting with people

564
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,740
on the help desk

565
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,600
and you'll learn quite a lot how how

566
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,600
users behave and how you should

567
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,340
communicate with them and how you should

568
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,380
not communicate with them so it's a

569
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,419
quite nice intro job to get into it

570
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:04,860
security later

571
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,580
then of course system administration uh

572
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,100
managing servers and getting all the the

573
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,620
idea how servers interact or servers

574
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,600
work what software exists there how to

575
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,760
configure it because if you know how to

576
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,880
configure software on a server you also

577
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,140
know what are the tricks what are the

578
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,000
configurations where it could be some

579
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,140
pitfalls where you can make

580
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,880
configuration errors so that could be

581
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,799
beneficial for like some red teaming

582
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,460
offensive offensive ins attacks or even

583
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,020
for the blue team to know okay very

584
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,299
configure stuff

585
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:37,919
then of course of course I teach

586
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,900
technician like if they have some

587
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,419
incident to go there and fix stuff like

588
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:46,200
the the mobile help desk in the end

589
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,000
um also a good foundation because you

590
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,679
also interact with people you fix

591
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,900
problems problem solving

592
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,240
and of course all software testing like

593
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,280
do you have a software that's and you

594
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,320
need to test it to see if all the cases

595
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,179
work how they should work if the

596
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:03,240
interface is okay to to use

597
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,679
and of course if you're a software

598
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,340
developer then you also know what first

599
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,240
of all that you can you can program that

600
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,440
you can

601
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,200
um what bugs you have prop often in

602
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,919
software how to maybe set up a devops

603
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,940
pipe a CI CD pipeline think about

604
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,980
security and software and so you get

605
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,860
some idea if you like change to it

606
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,679
security what you can test what I like

607
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,600
classical errors like SQL injections or

608
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,400
escaping whatever so there's some some

609
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,700
quite good ideas where to start with a

610
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,740
job for for getting the the basic

611
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,480
knowledge

612
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,860
then

613
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,620
um self learning

614
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,539
um there are really a lot of online

615
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:54,780
resources out there there are books

616
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,100
their online courses and one really good

617
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,720
um recommendation I can give you is like

618
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,960
work on your own project get some get

619
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,880
some interesting project and implement

620
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,640
it set up a lab or

621
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,140
and the first thing you have a

622
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,120
motivation and when you're done with it

623
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,100
you have you have managed to achieve

624
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,659
something and you can play around with

625
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:18,299
it and you you'll gain a lot of

626
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,240
knowledge by working on your own project

627
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,580
and I did also sometimes like I have

628
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,779
some idea I will just implement it and

629
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:30,659
figure around how how to do it uh how

630
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,580
can I improve the security of it for

631
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,419
example or so that's that's my biggest

632
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:37,640
biggest

633
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,500
recommendations get some project and

634
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,480
work on it on yourself or even with

635
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,760
colleagues together and you're gonna

636
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,840
have fun

637
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,700
and of course there's so much online

638
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,460
resources there's the YouTube tutorials

639
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,860
there are books still really good online

640
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,120
courses even by by universities like

641
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,919
universities offer free online courses

642
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,260
so you even get the certificate so I

643
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,659
first have some links later that I can

644
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:04,980
really recommend you and they're like

645
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,880
really courses from MIT from some UK

646
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,279
universities since it's for free so you

647
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,200
can really just go there and you have

648
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,260
like regular University online for for

649
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,880
four or eight weeks and you learn

650
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,559
something there and have like exercises

651
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:23,400
and exams and it's completely free you

652
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,659
just need to take your time and do that

653
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:30,000
then other one part of self-learning is

654
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,539
like doing capture the flags as as like

655
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,480
as a one thing to learn stuff because

656
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,120
you're competing at the fixed time frame

657
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,740
by the way there's also a capture of

658
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,600
flag here at balcon thanks to the to the

659
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,340
Slovenian people

660
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,840
um so if you if you want to check out

661
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,020
check it out it's super nice again and

662
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,640
the thing is you have various challenge

663
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,620
categories so you can choose what you're

664
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,779
interested in like you want to check to

665
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,940
test or to Panthers web apps or choose

666
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,400
the web category you will maybe to to

667
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,260
solve some programming problems so you

668
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,120
just use them the programming category

669
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,220
or you may be interested in forensics so

670
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,200
there's often a forensic I will need to

671
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,799
find some flag in a forensic image

672
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,320
um while doing capture Flex you're going

673
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,700
to improve your programming skills

674
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,260
because sometimes you just need like a

675
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,140
quick fix script to exploit some some

676
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,900
some some challenge with with so often

677
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,240
you just get Python and make some some

678
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,159
quick programming and then you can

679
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,200
exploit the challenge

680
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,600
but it's it's it's helping you to to

681
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,360
improve the program skills maybe find

682
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,840
some new libraries to use for for coding

683
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,120
and it's it's quite handy to to have

684
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,520
really solid programming skills that you

685
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,740
can like if you need it for just make a

686
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,960
quick script to test something

687
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,419
and they're often very technical

688
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,840
challenges so you can get the deeper

689
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,539
technical knowledge by by analyzing the

690
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,120
challenges and solving it like if you're

691
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,059
up for reverse engineering or to to

692
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,760
decode a protocol so it's a really good

693
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,580
idea to to look into that

694
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,700
and also one thing soft skills again

695
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,620
normally you do see devs in a team

696
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,720
so you need to communicate with the team

697
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,380
like what is your status or like

698
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,880
brainstorming them how to solve how to

699
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,220
solve a challenge so let's also think

700
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,720
that you that to learn with them like

701
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,360
working in a team how to communicate how

702
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,820
to how to exchange so that's also a good

703
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,320
thing you can learn by by playing

704
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,700
capture Flags

705
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,140
uh one important thing is that Capture

706
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,120
the Flag challenges often artificial

707
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,539
scenarios and so

708
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:42,419
it's often like some some self-made

709
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:45,480
challenge that often do not reflect real

710
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,659
world real world like you have some

711
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:49,919
Challenge and you're like just hunting

712
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,720
for this for this flag like just a

713
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,120
string but in the real world you are not

714
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,039
hunting for a string you're hunting for

715
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,860
for boxing software and you're not and

716
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,320
you need to test everything and you

717
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,020
don't know where the bug might be and

718
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,419
that's like the big difference between

719
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:08,100
capture the flags and the real world

720
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,380
when you do like pen testing

721
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,320
but I can at least say one time I had

722
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,360
some assessment and I was a capture the

723
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,220
flag challenge which was that was quite

724
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,640
real live so I could like with the CTF

725
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,440
challenge write up I could exploit the

726
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,899
service so it was like incident that I

727
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:26,880
checked out this write-up and it was

728
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,860
like handy that I had like the same

729
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,440
service so I could like abuse it it was

730
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,840
super cool that it what paid off to read

731
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,460
the write-ups

732
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,039
and also you can earn prices if you're

733
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,659
quite good with your team you can like

734
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,520
earn here do you like tickets for next

735
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,460
balcon or you get some money prices or

736
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,980
some vouchers or whatever so you can

737
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,659
also get some cool stuff while while

738
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:51,659
hacking and learning stuff

739
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:52,620
um

740
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,360
that's about capture the flags can

741
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,460
really recommend it it's fun especially

742
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,559
for a group of people and you learn a

743
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,678
lot

744
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,840
um another big thing is

745
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,580
conferences

746
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,880
plus volunteering so for conferences

747
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,820
you're here at balcon because it's an

748
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,140
awesome conference and you have really

749
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,299
cool dogs you have people to discuss and

750
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:18,000
and uh meet them so the first thing is

751
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,200
when you come come to a conference

752
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,779
you're getting to know people you can

753
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,760
create a network for a future like

754
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,860
discuss with them or maybe maybe there's

755
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,480
a work opportunity where you can like

756
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,940
give you like hey we hire new people

757
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,460
maybe you want to join us

758
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,960
um of course there are super awesome

759
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,179
talks most of the time and discussions

760
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,039
where you can participate

761
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:41,220
and also conferences are opportunity to

762
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,919
speak yourself there maybe have some

763
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,679
favorite topic you want to speak about

764
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,559
so come to a conference hand into a cfp

765
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,140
or even just use the lightning talks you

766
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,580
can use the lightning talks in five

767
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,620
minutes and show your favorite project

768
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,360
maybe the product you did to learn

769
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,279
something you can show it off say hey I

770
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,960
did this project and I learned this and

771
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,059
this and if you're interested come later

772
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:05,220
to me and we'll discuss this together so

773
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,140
it's a super opportunity to to speak

774
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,960
about your favorite topic and maybe get

775
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,179
some new inputs for your problems

776
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:14,640
like speak about current problems and

777
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,380
maybe people can give you some insights

778
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,659
like how they solved it or give you some

779
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:21,299
tips how how you could improve it

780
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:23,279
and also one thing about conference is

781
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,880
about volunteering there

782
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,799
you can when you volunteered conference

783
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,960
there are quite some benefits that you

784
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,659
can have like of course free entry at a

785
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:36,480
conference also quite nice often if you

786
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,360
can join a speaker's dinner and also one

787
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,460
thing is here it's not a problem because

788
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,260
all the speakers are going around you

789
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,240
can talk with them and everything but

790
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,580
they're like bigger conferences where

791
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,440
there is no real speaker interaction

792
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,299
it's like the speaker on the on the

793
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,940
stage and then it's like the Q and A

794
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,740
and afterwards the speaker just

795
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,539
disappears so it's just going for the

796
00:31:57,539 --> 00:31:59,880
conference or isn't really available to

797
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,340
discuss stuff afterwards but if you're

798
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,980
like a volunteer and you're like helping

799
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,020
the speaker on the stage whatever so you

800
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,460
have quite the possibility to interact

801
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,899
with them and ask them some questions

802
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,940
and get known to them that's quite a

803
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,980
nice cool thing

804
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,399
about knowledge there is even even even

805
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,980
more knowledge like as I said there are

806
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,960
online courses there's of course try

807
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,460
hacking you baby no it's a super cool

808
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,940
platform to to learn like the also I.T

809
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,279
security and I.T Basics there and it's

810
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,140
it's a free platform with some premium

811
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,940
stuff but even the free con is super

812
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,100
nice there is of course hack the box

813
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,620
which is more CTF like but also now have

814
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,860
more so try Hackney style Labs too and

815
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,840
also as always said online university

816
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,419
courses

817
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,399
um yeah there's of course videos

818
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,260
tutorials online

819
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,360
first of all thanks to all content

820
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,159
creators out there that do a really nice

821
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:55,620
job and help us really especially guys

822
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,659
who are doing uh lecturing math on

823
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,559
YouTube they helped me a lot in my study

824
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,260
and but all there's a thing often it's

825
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,419
hard to distinguish quality content on

826
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,460
YouTube but sometimes people also

827
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,020
telling the wrong stuff on videos and

828
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,059
tutorials so it's sometimes hard to

829
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,760
distinguish which Youtuber or which

830
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,340
person have good content I mean

831
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,899
sometimes people can tell yeah I know

832
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:21,240
this guy makes good stuff but uh

833
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,399
sometimes it's hard so the best is ask

834
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:25,140
maybe your colleagues your friends maybe

835
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,000
they have some recommendations which

836
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,799
tutorials or videos are good on YouTube

837
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,960
or which which people

838
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,620
and

839
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,360
there is a lot of platforms out there

840
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,220
out there people join and discuss

841
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,200
together stuff I mean there's there's

842
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,360
Discord days there are online forums

843
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,159
except online like dying more or less

844
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,320
but there are a lot of new platforms out

845
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,760
there where you can connect with people

846
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,000
like-minded people and discuss with them

847
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,700
solve problems meet meet in real world

848
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,460
go go on a club map and discuss system

849
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,019
stuff and

850
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:01,620
and especially in in covet times it got

851
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,539
bigger and bigger and it's a super good

852
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:06,659
opportunity to exchange with people

853
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:08,219
online they're quite some cool

854
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,320
communities out there

855
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,839
so I told you a lot of stuff about how

856
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,520
to get knowledge and everything and then

857
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,379
people say okay I got the knowledge but

858
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:19,800
I want more I want certifications

859
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,159
so the thing is about certifications yes

860
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,560
there exists and okay you want to do a

861
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,760
certification

862
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,159
choose please

863
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,260
so there is this uh really awesome

864
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,359
certification roadmap it's open source

865
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:38,879
there is the link also there I as I said

866
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,280
I will upload the flights and if really

867
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,879
a lot of certifications they cost uh

868
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,500
they have different costs and everything

869
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,060
and different

870
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,820
um they cover different topics so the

871
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,800
first thing is uh

872
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,780
for certifications

873
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,960
they normally cost money they may expire

874
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,060
like after three years they're expired

875
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,619
and need to renew it or make another

876
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:03,180
exam

877
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,000
sometimes certifications only teach

878
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,160
Theory and therefore for example and

879
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,560
they have no practical labs and they're

880
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,359
also like various exam formats like

881
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:15,180
often often certifications are like

882
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,660
multiple choice exams so you just are on

883
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,400
a computer and just do multiple choicing

884
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,579
and then you're done sometimes it's not

885
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,640
that it's I would say it's uh it's so

886
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,740
that the multiple choice stuff is more

887
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,079
the classic exam format but sometimes

888
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,700
there are certifications where you can

889
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,780
do

890
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,280
um

891
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,680
uh have also a practical part we'll need

892
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,960
to exploit something maybe to configure

893
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,359
something in a virtual lab and that's

894
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:44,099
that's also quite the more interesting

895
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:47,040
exam in my opinion and one very

896
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,660
important thing

897
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,220
just because a person has a

898
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,740
certification it does not mean that the

899
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,260
person really knows the stuff or does

900
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,480
the person that the certificate reflects

901
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,400
the real skills of the of the people of

902
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,500
the person because sometimes if it's a

903
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,720
multiple choice exam you just like can

904
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,180
check out maybe the question from like

905
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,099
Sam and just learn it and afterwards you

906
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,260
just pass somehow but it didn't really

907
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,119
really learn the stuff

908
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:15,119
and one really important thing is also

909
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,359
Knowledge and Skills are much more worth

910
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:20,460
than certifications if you have

911
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,079
Knowledge and Skills and if for example

912
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,300
if a super nice GitHub profile with your

913
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,900
projects up there and maybe doing some

914
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,599
capture flags and or super motivated and

915
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,220
you also put this in your CV like I'm

916
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,020
doing capture Flex here's my GitHub

917
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,119
profile I did this project

918
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:38,099
uh this is normally more often

919
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:40,560
certifications so if I am if a future

920
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,619
employee sees few future employers sees

921
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,300
that you're super active have projects

922
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,640
on GitHub you're doing capture flag work

923
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,820
maybe it's volunteering some somewhere I

924
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,500
think that's more worth than a person

925
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,599
has like two or three certifications but

926
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,099
no stuff outside of that

927
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,440
um I've I've covered I said I'm I'm

928
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,480
focusing on Friends of security for for

929
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,300
a certification part so I have like some

930
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,880
entry level recommendations as said

931
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,079
before

932
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,480
um I would rather recommend to have your

933
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,000
projects on GitHub volunteer somewhere

934
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,220
do CTS but if you say okay I have some

935
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,240
money left I want to do some

936
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,520
certification because maybe I want to

937
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,260
challenge myself I have at least some

938
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,079
set of one certificate for my CV I have

939
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:27,119
some at least three recommendations for

940
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,300
you for for this thing so those I have

941
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,099
three of them they're suitable for

942
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:34,440
beginners and intermediate and they're

943
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,680
quite cheap or affordable

944
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,380
um the first thing I I can recommend is

945
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,260
the EOP PT it's the e-learn security

946
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,680
Junior penetration tester certificate

947
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,079
um it's from the inner organization and

948
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,400
the cool thing is

949
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,280
basic labs and the the learning material

950
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,560
is free so there is a starter pass you

951
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,180
can register and you get these courses

952
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,700
for free but you only pay for a

953
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,760
certification for the exam and it's uh

954
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,060
200 for the exam and they're currently

955
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,240
and it's also a practical exam like you

956
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,220
have some labs to to pen test something

957
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,380
and some multiple choice questions so

958
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,940
it's a combination of practical and

959
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,140
multiple choice and also one thing is uh

960
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,800
now version two is incoming from agpt

961
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,859
um it's causing a better status but if

962
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:26,940
you're interested in this one I would

963
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,680
recommend to wait some some more weeks

964
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,680
or months for the for a version two they

965
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,660
improve some stuff

966
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,240
and it's that's still the same price for

967
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,460
200 dollars

968
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,619
so if you're interested in penetration

969
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,060
testing and want to get into this

970
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,440
feeling okay I have some money left I

971
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,240
want to do a certification then this

972
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,160
would be a good good starting point it's

973
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,859
quite affordable over 200 dollars

974
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:52,980
then another recommendation for

975
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,220
beginners are the offensive security

976
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,920
learn fundamentals so thank you there's

977
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,660
quite a lot of certification like the

978
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,500
well-known oscp but this one is so they

979
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,359
this they change it this one is quite

980
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:10,680
new that's a really fundamental basic

981
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,820
course

982
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,460
um do you have five courses to learn the

983
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,040
fundamentals you don't have really exams

984
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,200
that reflect some small assessments and

985
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,880
you just get like a certificate that you

986
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,619
that you finish the course and it's

987
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,180
really good because you learn all the

988
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,859
fundamentals for web security Cloud

989
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:29,880
Windows exploitation stock cryptography

990
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,020
um and you have 365 days for labs and

991
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,300
learning like you don't need to stress

992
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,820
yourself while doing this this learning

993
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,099
stuff so that's that's quite nice and

994
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:42,599
you have all the two certifications

995
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:45,839
included for as exam attempt for there's

996
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,900
some Khalid Linux Basics to sxam and

997
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,640
this is a wireless attack certification

998
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,800
how to how to do wireless attacks you

999
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,320
can also do that exam there it's it's

1000
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,099
more expensive it's like 800 but often

1001
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,200
if you have like some working somewhere

1002
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,820
and say hey I would like to work to

1003
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,339
start an I.T security probably your your

1004
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:07,980
employer gonna pay this and you can you

1005
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,540
can learn on it and especially if you

1006
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,920
like working somewhere and you have like

1007
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,640
36 365 days for that so it's easier like

1008
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,579
to do it like once one one day per week

1009
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:19,619
or in the evening whatever and you don't

1010
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:21,540
have the stress trading like one one

1011
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,220
month

1012
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,579
another certification which is quite new

1013
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:29,460
in the market is the pnpt it's the

1014
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,140
Professional Network penetration tester

1015
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,480
it's from TCM SEC maybe you know the guy

1016
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,980
from dcm's also makes really cool

1017
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,500
YouTube videos and

1018
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,500
um it's for for intermediate level if

1019
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,200
you've ordered some experience

1020
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,680
um you have it's quite cheap it costs

1021
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,720
like three to four hundred dollars so

1022
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,280
for three hundred dollars you only get

1023
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,760
the exam for 400 you get the exam and

1024
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,920
you get five courses to prepare for a

1025
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,720
whole for a whole exam

1026
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,480
it's quite new uh like it started I

1027
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,119
think last year or one and a half years

1028
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,940
ago with the whole course and what they

1029
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,560
really like is

1030
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,460
it has a really realistic exam scenario

1031
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,619
uh because if you know the oscp the oscp

1032
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:16,020
is is also a little bit higher from the

1033
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,619
knowledge but you have only 24 hours to

1034
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:22,140
pound five machines and you have 24

1035
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,200
hours to write a report at the oscp exam

1036
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,420
this exam is much better and much much

1037
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,940
more realistic because you have five

1038
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,119
days to pen test a Virtual Lab then you

1039
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,520
have two days to write a report and then

1040
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,099
you for the you need to do a debriefing

1041
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,980
in front of a jury or 15 minutes so it's

1042
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,599
a really realistic scenario like you

1043
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,000
would to have in a real world

1044
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,220
and as I said it's it's super cheap I

1045
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,380
bought it myself

1046
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,440
and I I'm currently on interrail I first

1047
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,240
thought I was learning in the train but

1048
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,040
not gonna happen

1049
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,440
but I'm gonna do that in when I'm back

1050
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,480
in Vienna again I want to want this

1051
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,099
certification because it's super cheap

1052
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,740
comparison table

1053
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,540
um I say the first two are beginner

1054
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,900
level and the PMP is intermediate

1055
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,920
um the exam format is for the aopt and

1056
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,420
for the PMP it is both like a practical

1057
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,440
exam

1058
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,260
and at the area PT is always like some

1059
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,480
some multiple choice part included

1060
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,599
for the offsec fundamentals is there is

1061
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,460
no real exam for the learning basic

1062
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,800
courses but if you want to do the Kali

1063
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,260
and the wireless course if you have a

1064
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,500
UFO Hands-On exam for the certification

1065
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,980
for the prices as you see they are they

1066
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,440
they're quite cheap and also sometimes

1067
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,000
also you can afford it yourself for

1068
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,579
example the aopt for 200 and the pmpt

1069
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:50,880
and for the optic fundamentals probably

1070
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,740
it's better if like the company pays it

1071
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,060
for you if you're like interested into

1072
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,320
the field and the company wants to

1073
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,640
support you

1074
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,400
one thing about ss8 for exploration

1075
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,740
before there are different things about

1076
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,040
expiration for example the aopt in the

1077
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,680
first version now has no expiration but

1078
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,720
in a version two it have expiration of

1079
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,339
three years so it's three years valid

1080
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,800
your your certificate for the optic

1081
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,960
fundamentals you have no certification

1082
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,640
because you did like just the intro

1083
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,680
course and for the two certifications

1084
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,720
there's also no expiration if you do it

1085
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,819
you're done and you have to certificate

1086
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:26,460
for a pmpt they changed it in the

1087
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,900
beginning they had like no expiration

1088
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,760
now they changed they have like it's

1089
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,460
called continuous education CE so you

1090
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,500
need to gather some CE points I think

1091
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,380
you need to gather 30 points in three

1092
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,440
years and and you can do it by like

1093
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,260
going to conferences having talks making

1094
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,900
doing another certification and it's

1095
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,180
quite doable and the other one thing is

1096
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,720
about I forgot to mention often

1097
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,099
certificate authorities that give you

1098
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:55,920
certificates out also want want money

1099
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,440
from you to renew the certificate or you

1100
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,000
need to be member of the certificate

1101
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,640
Authority and they're like want my

1102
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,680
yearly money from you

1103
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,400
but the pmpt people are not they don't

1104
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,920
want your money they say we want we they

1105
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,359
introduce the contingency to education

1106
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,160
because they want to go in more

1107
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,680
Industries and they they are then they

1108
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,300
want that the certificate has some kind

1109
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,079
of renewable stuff so they say if you

1110
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,520
meet the criteria we'll get the

1111
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,800
certificate renewed but we don't we

1112
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,380
don't want extra money from you for that

1113
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,540
so it's quite okay that they said okay

1114
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,940
you need to to to asset lifelong

1115
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,560
learning you need to to gather this

1116
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,660
education point but you don't need to

1117
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,399
pay to renew the certificate

1118
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,940
um

1119
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,720
so for the like more or less last slide

1120
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,619
is like reality and future I.T secret is

1121
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:52,500
growing really fast and uh

1122
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,359
people are needed people are sitting

1123
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,819
here please come and join us in this in

1124
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,619
this interesting

1125
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:01,500
cluster I really say because it's

1126
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,839
really a lot of stuff is broken and a

1127
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,720
lot of stuff needs to be fixed and a lot

1128
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,839
of challenges out there and we need

1129
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,819
curious people that want to want to

1130
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:15,420
tackle this uh a special systems are

1131
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,119
really complex so you're gonna have fun

1132
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:20,880
debugging the stuff or fixing it

1133
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,640
but it's a nice challenge I think you're

1134
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,920
you have quite some interesting topics

1135
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,780
and some interesting scenarios you're

1136
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,859
dealing with

1137
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:32,819
and also another problem is of course

1138
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:36,000
um criminals like apts are very

1139
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,400
professional groups that sometimes even

1140
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,260
company structure like they're getting

1141
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,300
paid and have holidays whatever it's

1142
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,880
like reality

1143
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,880
and they're they're so competitive

1144
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,160
really hard time by getting attacked by

1145
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,780
these apts and it's our goal first to to

1146
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,839
to get these criminals to to jail and

1147
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,400
the first another thing is that we

1148
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,040
should uh defend the companies that get

1149
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,560
attacked by them so help them improve

1150
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,380
their CIT security posture

1151
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,359
um have awareness trainings for the for

1152
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,760
the people in the companies Harden the

1153
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,140
system

1154
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,900
um test the system for bugs so I think

1155
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,359
that's that's our our thing we should we

1156
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,520
should we should do good as artistically

1157
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,079

then additional resources part two

1196
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:56,359

1206
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,260

out and just subscribe there then

1209
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,099
there's another Twitter Thread about uh

1210
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:28,079
also another another 10 free I.T

1211
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,540
security university courses

1212
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,140
um

1213
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,940
Irene to check it out it sounds quite

1214
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,260
interesting gonna maybe do another

1215
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,119
course in my free time because if it's

1216
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:39,240
free and you can learn something why not

1217
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,280
um then capture flag something it's

1218
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,700
quite hard to get into this because uh

1219
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,800
sometimes chances are super hard and you

1220
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,060
don't know how to start or don't have

1221
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,520
the knowledge and there's Pico CTF it's

1222
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,040
a it's a it's a beginner friendly CTF

1223
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,020
platform and you can really

1224
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,780
uh do beginner challenges and get like

1225
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,420
known to CTF format and it's super nice

1226
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,760
so if you if you want to get into

1227
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,339
capture the flags check out Pico CTF

1228
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:07,440
it's super cool to as for a beginning

1229
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,579
point

1230
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,260
another cool platform is over the wire

1231
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,420
they have all like war games like

1232
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,040
capture flag Channels with different

1233
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,200
levels and it's a super awesome super

1234
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,940
beginner thing because you have like for

1235
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,319
example you have a challenge where you

1236
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:21,960
start with SSH and you learn some basic

1237
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,119
Linux commands and need to find some

1238
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,700
files or some sizes that you can get to

1239
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,380
the next level and it's super

1240
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,880
interesting and you can learn a lot of

1241
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,859
stuff there too

1242
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:34,859
then uh the last thing or this the third

1243
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:36,599
last thing is the Twitter Thread about

1244
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,900
various capture flag platforms like try

1245
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,540
hack me Hector box other other CTF

1246
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,240
platforms uh check it out it's super

1247
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,920
nice you have quite a lot of there are a

1248
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,020
lot of a lot of platforms out there for

1249
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:53,160
for this kind of um hacking stuff

1250
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,740
um two last things uh

1251
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:59,160
ask your favorite search engine

1252
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,020
I don't recommend really Google they're

1253
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,660
like Dr go and other things but yeah if

1254
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,819
you use Google use Google but you can

1255
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:08,339
find a lot of stuff on internet too and

1256
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,099
the most important thing is ask your

1257
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:12,839
friends and colleagues they can give you

1258
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:14,640

okay I we can discuss it afterwards like

1286
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,980
it's a quite specific topic it's like

1287
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,480
out of scope of this talk but let's

1288
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,160
let's speak later together and we can

1289
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,819
discuss this

1290
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,640
um yeah I just had a question did you

1291
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,700
ever have an instance where you talked

1292
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,800
with a client and found out they didn't

1293
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,380
update their system in years and how did

1294
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,420
you deal with it

1295
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,280
the thing is

1296
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,400
on a professional level

1297
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,559
you must say you just say the customer

1298
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,900
hey you have an unpatched system that is

1299
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,819
not patched it's like already three

1300
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,619
years old no patches and you need to

1301
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:06,900
tell him you write the report and you

1302
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,240
write it's maybe critical or high

1303
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,160
vulnerability and say you need to patch

1304
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,440
it but

1305
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,119
it's it's a responsibility of the

1306
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,859
customer as a penetration test when I do

1307
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:18,540
a report when I do a pen test I give the

1308
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:21,000
custom report and the customer it's it's

1309
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,420
his or her like uh responsibility to

1310
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,800
patch the stuff we can give them

1311
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,240
recommendations but it's not our

1312
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,520
business we can tell him you could do it

1313
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,020
like this you can patch this you can

1314
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,460
implement this but that's the

1315
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,160
responsibility of the customer so in the

1316
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,040
end on a professional level

1317
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,480
it's not really your business in the end

1318
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,160
you can say hey we really recommend you

1319
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,400
to patch your systems but their their

1320
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,380
responsibility and they have to they

1321
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,000
have your report they have the papers

1322
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,240
and if some incident happens it's it's

1323
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,300
their problem in the end and you can't

1324
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,160
do more than telling them hey your

1325
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,520
systems are like unpatched it's I mean

1326
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,099
personally I'm feeling really bad and it

1327
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:03,359
hurts when I see some really broken

1328
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,460
system and people are not patching it

1329
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,579
but in the other hand it's their fault

1330
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:10,440
we give them help and and

1331
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,540
recommendations but if they don't do it

1332
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,119
it's like what you can do it's like it's

1333
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,839
out of your scope

1334
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,339
what about if you discover uh

1335
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,880
vulnerability in for example a national

1336
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,800
health system or something which impacts

1337
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,619
everything is it your responsibility to

1338
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:38,880
disclose that to the entire world or do

1339
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,760
you still go through the channels

1340
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,160
that's a really good question in my

1341
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,280
opinion if you have really big uh like I

1342
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,839
don't know Health Organization with all

1343
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:51,300
Health public data like if you have some

1344
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,559
bug where you can get all the Health

1345
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,240
Data of the people

1346
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,579
of course first it's of course your

1347
00:53:56,579 --> 00:53:58,740
responsibility that you disclose this

1348
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:01,559
but I think it's not the way to disclose

1349
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:03,660
it publicly but like

1350
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,780
for example you can write the third

1351
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:10,020
computer emergency response team that

1352
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:13,079
can forward the the back to the to the

1353
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:16,920
authority and help them fix it but in my

1354
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,020
opinion it's it's a big move to make a

1355
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,520
public announcement that people probably

1356
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,920
abuse your bug and and and steal the

1357
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,380
data of course you should do good as a

1358
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,300
testicular professional or as a t person

1359
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,000
and you should also use appropriate

1360
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,220
channels to get this information to the

1361
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:35,480
right person personal

1362
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,020
well then thank you very much and see

1363
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,940
