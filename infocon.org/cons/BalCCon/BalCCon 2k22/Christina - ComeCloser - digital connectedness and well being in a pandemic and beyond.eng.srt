[Music]

2
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,130
thank you

3
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,660
[Music]

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,820
thank you all

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,220
um I'm so happy to be at biocon again

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,000
after a very long time and as you will

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,700
see my talk is somehow related to the

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,219
fact that we couldn't have a rear biocon

9
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,399
for quite some time

10
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,500
um because today I would like to speak

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,079
about human Connections in a time of

12
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,579
physical distancing

13
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,739
and of course when I say physical

14
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,079
distancing the first thing that comes to

15
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:55,879
mind

16
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:59,039
are the conditions in a pandemic

17
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,920
but we know that the trends

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,319
um that originated even before the

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,140
pandemic are here and will possibly

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,720
continue even after covert has become

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,979
less of a problem

22
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,960
so obviously this is not a tutorial and

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,939
it's not a how to lecture

24
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,619
um or even a presentation of original

25
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,479
research

26
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,420
um I would cite research by others um

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,460
but my main intention is to start a

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,400
discussion among ourselves

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,380
um I'm sure that every one of you has

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,900
their own experiences with regards to

31
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,320
this matter

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,960
so I think the main problem or issue

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,939
that I want to present here can be

34
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,619
summed up very concisely in this

35
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,079
question why are we here

36
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,399
and to be more specific why are we here

37
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,619
and not at home streaming this event

38
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:57,119
we all know that virtual events are

39
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,299
cheaper they are more convenient and you

40
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,040
could also say they are more inclusive

41
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,860
for people who are not able to travel

42
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,619
for some kind of reason

43
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:09,720
so why are there still real life events

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,459
even though we have the technological

45
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,660
means

46
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,160
um to do everything online only

47
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,500
so to answer this question I will start

48
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,959
with some research

49
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,540
the U.S firm pure research has published

50
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,239
statistics that show that indeed virtual

51
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,580
meetings in chat and video calls have

52
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,739
been extremely important for people

53
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,080
during the pandemic

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,780
this has been true for 90 percent of U.S

55
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,040
adults

56
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,720
um and I think in other countries the

57
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,360
numbers will be quite similar

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,239
at the same time as you see here 40

59
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,819
percent of U.S adults were complaining

60
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:52,640
of the phenomenon known as Zoom fatigue

61
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,420
and here's another study with German

62
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,239
adults in which the numbers were even

63
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,239
higher almost 60 percent had experienced

64
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,760
Zoom fatigue and these numbers are only

65
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,640
from 2020 so I would assume that after

66
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,920
more than two years of pandemic the

67
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,119
numbers are even higher

68
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,500
so

69
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,440
what is zoom fatigue

70
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,940
it's the generic term for the side

71
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,739
effects of spending too much time in

72
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,200
video calls so it doesn't only refer to

73
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,840
zoom but to any kind of video chat

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,920
platform

75
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,800
and mainly it is a feeling of exhaustion

76
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,959
and stress

77
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,659
and Studies have shown that there are

78
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,239
many many causal factors for Zoom

79
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:40,560
fatigue

80
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,640
um

81
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,400
okay I'm sorry you probably can't read

82
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,959
any of them and they're in German anyway

83
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,560
so I will tell you um the most important

84
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,500
factors that lead to zoom fatigue

85
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,659
um is the fact that you lose all the

86
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,080
non-verbal cues that um you have in a

87
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,239
physical interaction

88
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,519
um that means um you learn more about

89
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,280
the other person's intentions and moods

90
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,459
by watching them and um watching the

91
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,879
small movement of their faces and um the

92
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,060
exact tilt of their voices and um in a

93
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,680
zoom meeting you only have an

94
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,478
approximation of that and a lot of

95
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,560
information gets lost

96
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,940
um and another problem that's related

97
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,699
are bad audio quality and audio and

98
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,199
video delays

99
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,180
um you know this phenomenon when

100
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,340
everyone talks at once and then they

101
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,740
notice and then everyone stops talking

102
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,720
that's one example

103
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,639
so in summary you have to concentrate

104
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,419
more and listen harder in video meetings

105
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,460
but because you don't have to travel

106
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,580
physically from one meeting place to

107
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,620
another they are often scheduled back to

108
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,320
back which means that you also have less

109
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,300
time for small talk for breaks for

110
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,320
recreation for anything

111
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,460
so as a result and I'm going back to the

112
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,699
Pew study here again said only 17 of the

113
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,400
US adults say that

114
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,000
um

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,880
uh digital meetings for them are as good

116
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,259
as in-person meetings

117
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,139
but still we need some kind of solution

118
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,320
for situations in which we can't meet in

119
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,699
person

120
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,100
um otherwise there are not only problems

121
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,440
for businesses but also in an increase

122
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,160
in what is known as Lockdown loneliness

123
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,820
um this uh here I'm citing a study that

124
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,220
has looked as at groups that are most at

125
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,580
risk for lockdown loneliness and it was

126
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,740
specifically about conditions in the

127
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,000
pandemic

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,100
but I would assume that these

129
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,520
populations here adults who are who are

130
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,100
living on their own or who have had

131
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,280
problems and um kind of surprisingly

132
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,560
also young people and of course old

133
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,080
people and minorities

134
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,240
um all those populations I would think

135
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,400
that they are at increased risk for

136
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,800
loneliness also outside of the pandemic

137
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,800
conditions

138
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,900
um and there are even pre-pandemic

139
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,520
Trends

140
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,940
um for example this one shown here

141
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,979
um that lead to an increased risk for

142
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:26,520
example in many countries the number of

143
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,220
single person households is increasing

144
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,220
and there are other trends like

145
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,360
demographic change meaning that there's

146
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,780
a higher proportion of all people in a

147
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,440
country that contribute to the fact that

148
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,160
there are large proportions

149
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,620
of of the population who are at higher

150
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,419
risk of being alone

151
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,860
so for a time

152
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,539
um I think people believe that social

153
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,479
media could be the answer

154
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:02,400
there are a lot of studies

155
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,620
um on on this matter

156
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,520
um there are some varying results here's

157
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,160
one example of a study that shows that

158
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,199
real-life friends

159
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,340
um

160
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,520
make people happier that's a fact and

161
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,620
social media friends in this study have

162
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,620
no certain effect on happiness or

163
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,500
neither negative nor positive but

164
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,759
interestingly

165
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,699
um frequent logging on to social media

166
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,039
correlates with unhappiness

167
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,020
um but we don't know cause and effect

168
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,479
here so it could be that frequent logons

169
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,020
to social media make a person unhappy or

170
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,880
the other way around that an unhappy

171
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,240
person is more likely to often log on to

172
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,020
social media

173
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,539
so of course Facebook is kind of

174
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,340
outdated anyway

175
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,020
um there are always new social media and

176
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,080
new ways of um of trying to create a

177
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,199
feeling of digital connectedness

178
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,120
this example

179
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,580
um is mukbang is a Korean Trend meaning

180
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,800
that people meet on streaming channels

181
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,039
to watch each other eat

182
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,360
the technical term is digital

183
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,759
commensality

184
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,160
and this may be a kind of very specific

185
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,460
example but it shows that people

186
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,400
um have a kind of deep-seated Desire not

187
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,740
to be alone especially when doing

188
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,360
something as important as eating

189
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,279
so all those different kinds of digital

190
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,740
being together they have one thing in

191
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,880
common people can't touch each other

192
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,220
and this may be important because social

193
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,040
touch meaning the kind of touch that you

194
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,260
give each other during

195
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,560
um normal things in in daily life

196
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,940
um this kind of social touch it

197
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,160
influences the hormone levels in humans

198
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,920
for example oxytocin

199
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,720
and these in turn have an influence on

200
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,080
other physical processes for example if

201
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,339
you have a lot of

202
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,380
um or just a regular amount of social

203
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,220
touch this reduces the severity of pain

204
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,040
and not only of physical pain but also

205
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,080
of the pain that we feel when we are

206
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,700
socially excluded

207
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,820
on a neuronal level these two are quite

208
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,300
similar

209
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,959
so in my opinion this lack of social

210
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,660
touch during the pandemic may be one

211
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,459
factor in explaining why some people

212
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,620
were increasingly frightened and angry

213
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,320
during the course of the pandemic and

214
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,240
this is of course a political and a

215
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,459
social problem but it may also be a

216
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,899
neuronal and a physical problem

217
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,500
once again leads to the question whether

218
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,959
it is possible for people to touch each

219
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,740
other physically in a digital world

220
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,120
um and at the present time physical

221
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,360
touch cannot be realistically recreated

222
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,680
in virtual reality

223
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,260
but people are already working on it and

224
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,060
there have been experiments in which

225
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,600
people were touched touched by tactile

226
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,300
devices in VR and they actually

227
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,580
experienced this like the presence of

228
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,680
another human being it's um what they

229
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,779
call in technical terms the feeling of

230
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,779
cold presence that someone is there with

231
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,959
you

232
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,920
but physical touch is not the only

233
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,620
Factor important for our well-being

234
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,519
when you hear the word intimacy

235
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,959
maybe you automatically think of

236
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,940
physical intimacy

237
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,600
but even years before the pandemic it

238
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,700
has been shown that meaningful intimacy

239
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,100
can be can be created online even

240
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,279
without physical touch or VR touch

241
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,440
and with meaningful I mean that it

242
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,440
improves the mood and the well-being and

243
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,160
therefore health of a person

244
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,260
um and it has been shown for example in

245
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,600
this study that there are two elements

246
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,760
that are necessary for this kind of

247
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,140
online intimacy the first is

248
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,459
self-disclosure and the other one is

249
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,440
social support

250
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,800
um in other words you share something

251
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,079
about yourself and in return you receive

252
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,740
positive feedback and social support

253
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,579
from the other person

254
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,300
so actually when you think about it

255
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,339
there were ways to do that even before

256
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,560
we were digitally connected

257
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,660
and I will show you two examples that

258
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,839
are having kind of a comeback in recent

259
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,920
years

260
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,040
the first is writing real physical

261
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,100
letters and I'm sharing some of my own

262
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,920
experiences here and I'm showing you a

263
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,700
few

264
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,279
um real intangible things that people

265
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,540
send to me

266
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,560
um starting maybe 20 years ago and that

267
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,200
I kept all this time and um that have

268
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
those connections have also led to

269
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,320
in-person meetings that I think created

270
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,560
um lasting memories for all of us

271
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,180
and the other thing

272
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,760
another good example of going out and

273
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,040
sharing something about yourself and the

274
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,560
things that interest you with the world

275
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,620
um are zines and they are also having a

276
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,740
kind of comeback in in recent years

277
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,440
and they are self-made magazines that

278
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,720
have been around since I think at least

279
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,300
the 1980s when photocopying became

280
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,959
affordable for everyone

281
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:43,680
um

282
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,100
so I have put here a link on YouTube for

283
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,500
any of you who are interested to watch

284
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,160
the short introductions introduction

285
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,620
um but there are also problems of course

286
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,740
with these ways of interacting with a

287
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,139
distant world

288
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,700
um one is you may simply not be

289
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,040
interested in any of these things

290
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,720
um so if your favorite mode of

291
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,860
interaction

292
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,620
um with the world is to play sports with

293
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,980
a large group of people then these

294
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,440
suggestions will not help you in any way

295
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,120
but another important problem is that

296
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,420
this kind of interaction is kind of hard

297
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,399
it is slow you have to wait for feedback

298
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,440
from others and not all of the materials

299
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,220
may be readily available to you

300
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,920
so what do you do when you wake up at

301
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,139
night at 3am and you want to be

302
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,899
entertained um probably you will turn on

303
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,120
any of the social media that are

304
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,500
available to you

305
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,240
maybe you would rather read a physical

306
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,120
design but um they cannot be obtained

307
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,579
with the same immediency as anything

308
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,120
digital

309
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,620
and the German sociologist had mood Rosa

310
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,300
called this the problem of

311
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,519
uncontrollability

312
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,980
in simple words he says that we have

313
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,860
lost the will to wait for something that

314
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,019
is slow or inconvenient and not

315
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,360
available at the click of a button

316
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,579
even if the actual experience would be

317
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,620
better than anything that is available

318
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,680
on on digital media right now

319
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,920
in other words we want to control what

320
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,500
is available to us at any point in time

321
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,720
and I think in particular this is a

322
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
mindset of Silicon Valley

323
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,160
they even want life itself to be

324
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,560
available at their demand as this quote

325
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,620
from Peter Thiel shows

326
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,620
and I think um this is an illusion we

327
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,720
also have to accept that the desire for

328
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,180
human company sometimes cannot be

329
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,439
satisfied immediately

330
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,940
but fortunately now we are here at

331
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,600
biocon again after a long time and where

332
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,000
many New Impressions and experiences are

333
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,860
available to us that are not available

334
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,480
at home

335
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,320
um so I will end my short talk here

336
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,420
um and invite you to discuss really

337
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,579
after this talk or maybe in the evening

338
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:18,180
or during the other days about what you

339
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,820
think about this whole set of problems

340
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,220
that we are faced with

341
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,339
um

342
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,500
so here are the scientific papers that

343
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,180
are used and if you want to do any

344
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,899
further reading on this meta then you

345
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,180
can download the slides and look up the

346
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,560
papers

347
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,220
um

348
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,820
thank you

349
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:47,128
[Applause]

350
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:53,359
are there any questions

351
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,240
um hello have you been reading maybe the

352
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,019
Brave New World from the

353
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:05,220
oldest Huxley

354
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,260
I'm a bit embarrassed to say that I know

355
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,420
it only from quotations and references

356
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,579
and I have never read it no

357
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,980
well I would like to to really recommend

358
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,100
you to to to try to find it it is the

359
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,040
book that is written before the 1984.

360
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,639
and after the the other book that is

361
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,019
called the we by a Russian author uh

362
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,060
unblock my mind now but that's that's

363
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,279
not the point the main thing about the

364
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:35,820
Brave New World is the separation from

365
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,779
the human individuals uh where uh

366
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,959
children are actually conceived outside

367
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,800
of the human bodies they are raised I

368
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,019
mean not not raised they're from embryo

369
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:53,060
phase until the born they are fed in in

370
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,279
for instance some sort of a jar it's not

371
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:00,120
relevant for for the thing and just not

372
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,880
to make them all perfect they are

373
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,260
poisoned so their Alphas batters gamas

374
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,980
Delta and Epsilon so Alphas are are not

375
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,540
poison at all they are targeted for the

376
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,240
governing government and and high

377
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,839
positions betas are regular working

378
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,760
people gamers are low working people

379
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,559
Deltas are people working the things

380
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,100
that are bad and

381
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,440
gamas are working in mines and and the

382
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,059
things that that no one would actually

383
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:39,539
normally work uh there are very

384
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,000
interesting things about the the culture

385
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,059
being projected on them but the the main

386
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,820
problem is that actually people are so

387
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,660
separated that they they don't have any

388
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,720
uh not physical interaction but they

389
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,760
don't they also don't have a sexual

390
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,799
intercourse and they are consuming it in

391
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,840
a way that they use some kind of a

392
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,880
virtual reality to to to to to have some

393
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,419
sort of and the idea of having a

394
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:16,080
physical touch is is quite repulsive in

395
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,679
the in the in that society and the thing

396
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,780
is uh and and it's not concerned with

397
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,900
the covet actually I think that the

398
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,200
thing is that in our society

399
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,500
although we all strive to have a

400
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,860
physical contact to have a recognition

401
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,460
from the real people not some virtual

402
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,280
friends from some Facebook or or any

403
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,520
other media but at the same time people

404
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,120
are getting more and more afraid of the

405
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,020
of the actual physical contact

406
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,720
for instance in conferences like this

407
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,340
they're usually just islands of the

408
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,520
people that already know each other and

409
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,539
rarely and and and I I see that as a

410
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,580
progression that even less and even less

411
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,280
people are trying to communicate with

412
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,360
the different people uh usually being

413
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,660
frightened by the different cultures

414
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,120
different

415
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,780
ways of life ideas and in in this

416
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,200
unfortunate modern worlds and you may

417
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,679
correct me if I'm wrong we are we are

418
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,860
kind of a rising in that fear from the

419
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,320
different people like immigrants like

420
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,860
different religion or things and and we

421
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,340
are actually drawing ourselves more uh

422
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,640
into the to some of the safe circles and

423
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,160
even in those safe circles uh people are

424
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,919
falling apart because you know when when

425
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,460
you hang out with someone for 20 years

426
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,740
you get some problems and then then your

427
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,620
your circle of friends is getting even

428
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,120
even uh smaller and smaller so I would

429
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,940
like just to suggest those ideas as

430
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,780
opposing I I do understand and and we

431
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,660
all actually either living alone or

432
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,120
living in some kind of a community we

433
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,780
all really strive to be uh recognized as

434
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,780
a friends as a humans as a potential

435
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,240
Partners but at the same time I think

436
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,039
that this uh virtual thing of social

437
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:31,320
media networks which basically didn't

438
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,240
start with the internet but that started

439
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,120
with the television when we substituted

440
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,000
the the the hanging out with friends we

441
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,640
substituted for the sitcoms and and and

442
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,760
movies you know when I don't know uh for

443
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,000
for Germany but in in Serbia like in in

444
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,419
in in in 70s or or in 80s there were

445
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,880
like one channel or two channels and and

446
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,160
uh after midnight there were no

447
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,880
television at all until the 7 00 uh a.m

448
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,820
or or something so so I would like if

449
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,179
you can comment on on this uh this

450
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:09,000
opposite things that is that we as a

451
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,660
humans we don't evolve that fast as we

452
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,660
involve uh intellectually so

453
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,900
intellectually we are growing fears uh

454
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,240
from others we are growing fears from

455
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,820
touch and and even with this covet thing

456
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,799
the touch is even more prohibited like

457
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:30,600
not only social distance but but the

458
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,640
physical distance we have the social

459
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,159
distance long time ago but we have now

460
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:38,520
physical distance which is uh almost

461
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,520
like uh desirable kind of kind of a

462
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,940
thing or or behavior and at the same

463
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,120
time while it is really happening we are

464
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,000
all feeling the the pain because we are

465
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,140
kind of a social beings I mean our

466
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,539
closest relatives like primates or

467
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,900
monkeys that they they they do live

468
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,960
still the way that we don't and the the

469
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,780
the graph that you you showed about the

470
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,200
people who are living solitary and we do

471
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,960
have solitary animals like cats cats are

472
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,780
solitary they're not living in in a in

473
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,500
chunks like like dogs and we are also

474
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,539
closer to the dogs because we do live in

475
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:25,260
a in a kind of tribes so when I look at

476
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,620
that graph I saw that that mostly

477
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,059
Northern people

478
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:33,539
are mostly living solitary and when you

479
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,340
look at at the bottom like Portugal

480
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,020
Spain Croatia Greece we are mostly

481
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,120
living together with with strong family

482
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,120
ties so I would just like if you can

483
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,480
comment a bit about this uh thing that

484
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,840
that we are inside emotionally we are

485
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,539
striving to to be uh in a company

486
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,780
because we just feel that from our guts

487
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,260
we we feel that and at the same time uh

488
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,500
culture and and things around us are

489
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,100
driving us apart and the thing that you

490
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,159
said that it is really a question if you

491
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:14,100
look at the Facebook are lonely people

492
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,280
more on the Facebook or being on a

493
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,679
Facebook makes them more lonelier

494
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,780
because they kind of a

495
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,700
substitute their real need for the for

496
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,620
the real touch they said okay I have

497
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,900
friends I have a social interaction and

498
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,840
and that's good yeah

499
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,500
um that's a trend that I recognize very

500
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,559
much and I think maybe this fear of

501
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,020
company I haven't really included in the

502
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,240
talk but

503
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,179
um yes you are absolutely right that um

504
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,280
that's why I liked

505
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,940
um to read about controllability by hard

506
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,559
mode Rosa because

507
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,280
um

508
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,020
I think

509
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,419
um you mentioned that this process

510
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,580
started with the TV

511
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,580
um and then later there was the internet

512
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,919
and social media and

513
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,080
um what all of them have in common is

514
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,179
that they provide the illusion of having

515
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,299
company but in a safe way in a way that

516
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:18,240
you can just decide to switch off

517
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,080
which you can't do with real company

518
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,539
and real human company has a lot of

519
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:27,900
advantages but also disadvantages and

520
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,020
risks and once I think you stop dealing

521
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,600
with those disadvantages you

522
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,539
um you you start

523
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,400
um you are not used to them anymore and

524
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,380
this is a process that gets worse and

525
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,059
worse

526
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,260
um

527
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,860
uh like when you have a little fear of

528
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,539
something and you start avoiding it the

529
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,000
fear becomes bigger and bigger

530
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,059
um and I think to stay healthy not only

531
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:00,539
in body but in mind also you have to

532
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,760
allow for un

533
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,860
um uncontrolled experiences for

534
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,080
surprises and for things that you have

535
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,179
not

536
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:11,880
expected because otherwise your bubble

537
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,440
will become smaller and smaller and I

538
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,179
think that's not healthy in any way

539
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:17,640
because as organisms

540
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,360
um we need to be challenged all the time

541
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,000
if you if you avoid

542
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,659
all kinds of surprises then it will be

543
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,840
for your mind like staying in bed all

544
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,779
day is for your body in my opinion

545
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:34,620
um

546
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,419
so

547
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:41,539
that's a trend that you see in in

548
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,820
other parts of the human experience as

549
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,799
well for example when we travel we want

550
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,840
everything to be controlled and when a

551
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,460
surprise happens it's not a surprise

552
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,880
it's um it means that the the whole

553
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,100
journey is a bad one

554
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,320
um but I think with regard to human

555
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,440
interaction it's um this problem of

556
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,140
wanting controllability

557
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,880
um is the worst at the moment yes

558
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,779
and um I think you could have a whole

559
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,919
new

560
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,220
talk about that so maybe I'll take it as

561
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,860
a suggestion for next year

562
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,220
it's very interesting and you could say

563
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,279
and study a lot about it and

564
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,620
um especially it's very important for

565
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,459
all of us yeah

566
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,059
um hello I have a small question for you

567
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:39,240
I'm here I'm here hello hi

568
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,520
um thank you for presentation I I had a

569
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,400
small question because many many think

570
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,159
changed during the kovids and the

571
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,860
physical isolation that we were forced

572
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,919
I'm from France so we had a few um how

573
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:55,679
to say a few quarantines the lockdowns

574
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,419
that happened yeah I'm looking for my

575
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:00,360
words thank you and I was wondering

576
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,799
about uh adults and children going

577
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,360
through training sessions or curses uh

578
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,320
on on Zoom or whatever video calling

579
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,240
you're you're using and I'm always

580
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,760
wondering I was thinking about two

581
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,700
questions the first one is is there any

582
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,380
study that

583
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,159
um

584
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,120
that shows if it's as efficient as

585
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,940
physical physical teaching in a school

586
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,900
or in in class and the second one is

587
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,059
attention span let us say the the time

588
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,460
that you have to focus and the time

589
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,340
after what you need the break to be able

590
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,279
to learn again uh in schools you have

591
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,559
five to ten minutes break sometimes and

592
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,480
I was wondering if you have any insights

593
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,740
on how to do our best because it still

594
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,600
still happens today that we have remote

595
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,460
remote training sessions or remote

596
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,799
courses do you have any any insight on

597
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,539
this thank you

598
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,580
um I'd start with the second question

599
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,120
um uh I will just talk about the

600
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,500
question of children and teenagers maybe

601
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,779
um there are two aspects um the first is

602
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,880
that children

603
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,640
um mostly learn by doing and not by

604
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,020
watching

605
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,000
um so this is obviously a problem but

606
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,120
the other problem that um comes when

607
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,900
when you have teenagers or children at

608
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,539
the verge of of teenagers

609
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:33,360
um it has also been shown that zoom and

610
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,580
other platforms they negatively affect

611
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,080
their self-image because they are

612
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,440
looking at themselves for hours

613
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,539
and they will notice

614
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:45,059
not their flaws but what they think are

615
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,400
their own flaws and then maybe they will

616
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,279
compare themselves to Instagram photos

617
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:53,400
or something so that's also a problem

618
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,419
um

619
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:56,279
can you just repeat the first question

620
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,620
very shortly we don't have a lot of time

621
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,860
left I'm sorry but what thank you the

622
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,400
first question was is uh are courses

623
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,820
done remotely with video conferences uh

624
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,480
tools are there as efficient as but I

625
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,279
think you've already a bit answered

626
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,919
about this yeah is is are there as

627
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,260
efficient as physical uh with the

628
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,659
teacher inside the same room physically

629
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,779
or remotely is

630
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:25,980
you mean

631
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,120
well again that as a that that question

632
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,000
um it depends on what um parameters

633
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,980
you're looking for so what what is

634
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,320
efficient anyway and what population are

635
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,360
you looking at so I haven't read all the

636
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,360
studies about um this question but

637
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,000
um I would imagine that um depending on

638
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,940
the research question you would get very

639
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,179
different results for example if you

640
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:53,520
look at the problem of accessibility and

641
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,279
inclusion then I think you would see

642
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,559
that people access online courses who

643
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,240
are not able to access physical courses

644
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,880
so that's a plus for online obviously

645
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,980
um but um the other thing is if um

646
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,380
there's anything that has to do with

647
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,020
physical skills

648
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,659
um it will not be as efficient and then

649
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:15,200
again there comes this thing about um

650
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,899
Zoom fatigue and also the factor that

651
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:20,640
sometimes even if you don't learn

652
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,179
anything physical it helps to walk

653
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:27,720
around while learning which is why some

654
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,419
professors already suggest suggested

655
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,820
that it makes more sense to take a video

656
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,940
call or a video course on your

657
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,740
smartphone or tablet so that you can

658
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,600
actually walk around by taking the

659
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,700
course because that helps um the

660
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,919
learning process as well yeah

661
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,260
thank you

662
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,660
[Applause]

663
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:18,899
[Music]

664
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,559
thank you
