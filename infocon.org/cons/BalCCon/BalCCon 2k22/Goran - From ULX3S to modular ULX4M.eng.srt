00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,680
[Music]

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,520
thank you

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,939
[Music]

5
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,960
okay next up we are gonna hear something

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,520
about open source options for fpga so in

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,180
the presentation from ulx 3S to modular

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,040
UL x4m from Karen

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,420
so hi to all today I will present

10
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,200
when I get the picture

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,970
[Laughter]

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,899
so I am Goran from Zagreb and today I

13
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,879
will present some stuff we are doing in

14
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,719
Zagreb mostly related to open source

15
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,939
fpga stuff but there are some things

16
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,680
that we are doing like

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,360
out of those

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,380
so I'm uh I spent like 15 years in as a

19
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,260
repair technician and that actually that

20
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,740
experience helped me helps me now a lot

21
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,380
when I'm like designing hardware and

22
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,119
doing software I am a co-founder of

23
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,080
Intergalactic the company that is

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,680
selling these those open source boards

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,920
and the company was founded actually

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,140
from the radiona my Makerspace I am in

27
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,060
the maker space for

28
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,020
about 10 years or so so we are doing

29
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,600
lots of different stuff in the Radeon

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,759
I'll show that later

31
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,000
so radiona is a non-profit also it's NGO

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,119
it's a

33
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,159
we do lots of different stuff so it's

34
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,560
like a combination of Makerspace

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,600
hackerspace so we hang around there

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,299
doing like lots of art stuff lots of

37
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,240
electronics lots of exhibitions for the

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,979
museums and having lots of workshops and

39
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,720
and many different things and like

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,599
radiona is really

41
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,819
the place where all different like

42
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,780
people gather so we have lots of people

43
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,420
from like doing Electronics some people

44
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,819
are like from the art sector or some are

45
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,360
from like designers and so and then when

46
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,720
we do some work we usually combine like

47
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,920
uh

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,140
things from from

49
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,940
that

50
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,459
so we have lots of different types of

51
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,860
workshops this is from one Workshop that

52
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,400
we are doing like uh robot fights and we

53
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,700
are using like old trash something like

54
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,000
Wacom cleaner and like something to to

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,340
get the robots

56
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,019
and uh

57
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,180
yeah people like to hang around in

58
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,819
Radion and we have like more around

59
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,420
maybe two two workshops per month

60
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,680
uh

61
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,080
uh most of them are

62
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,700
like from external external

63
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,159
lecturers or teachers and some are like

64
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,940
internals and once a month we are doing

65
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,480
like repair Cafe because lots of us is

66
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,640
also related in this

67
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,280
repair stuff like Mario is here as

68
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,739
wanted they are also repair technicians

69
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,379
so we are doing it like and we are not

70
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,379
doing it like that we are preparing we

71
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,120
are just people bring their own

72
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,400
electronics and they just say this is

73
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,920
not working for me we just check like

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,260
what would be the next step and give

75
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,599
them the tools and explain what this

76
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,459
device is doing and how it is working

77
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,920
and they they actually they repair the

78
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,200
device themselves so that's the idea not

79
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,360
that I'm working there like like a

80
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,640
technician repairing stuff but to

81
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,840
actually show what devices are doing and

82
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,560
show how to repair them to others

83
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,739
and yeah most of my talk will be related

84
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,480
with the fpgas and like fpgas have some

85
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,260
like complex

86
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,800
complex

87
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,139
explanation but

88
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,460
if you if we want it like oversimplify

89
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,800
the this explanation so fpga would be

90
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,860
like to having a enormous amount of like

91
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,400
switches inside of some chip and you can

92
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,300
like put that switch on or off and get

93
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,699
some like some this electronic design

94
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,240
inside of this uh inside of this fpga so

95
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,940
you will have the inputs and outputs and

96
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,180
we all signals will pass through through

97
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,759
this logic and you will have the end

98
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,240
logic at the at the end so and you can

99
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,620
do more any digital logic inside of the

100
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,600
fpgs fpgas are

101
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,240
consists of like many things and some

102
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,639
have like you probably know that some

103
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,919
have already have like microcontrollers

104
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,560
but the one we are using it doesn't have

105
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,080
microcontroller but it has some memories

106
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,400
and some other stuff in inside

107
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,740
so when you're doing like fpga's design

108
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,080
you are not writing code you are

109
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,060
actually doing it like on the breadboard

110
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,639
so you are like having modules like the

111
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,500
chips and you are describing those

112
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,400
modules and when you get the finished

113
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,080
like on the microcontroller you will get

114
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,900
the you you have like firmware but here

115
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,360
you you actually have the bit stream

116
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,460
that is like describing what the

117
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,919
hardware is looking like so

118
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,280
actually bitstream is description of uh

119
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,800
of the modules inside and description of

120
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,960
the hardware so you are not writing like

121
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,600
it's not a sequential code it's just

122
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,880
everything is happening in parallel like

123
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,000
on this breadboard so you have just USB

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,060
input and lots of modules or here are

125
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,460
the chips

126
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,919
and and also uh

127
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,400
the language all languages that are

128
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,860
describing the hardware are called like

129
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,340
HDL so Hardware description language

130
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,000
and there are many languages most used

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,759
is like verilog or vhdl and now days

132
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,340
there are like lots of more things like

133
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,759
now we can also do things in python or

134
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,460
something but in any any language like

135
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,560
we are doing it describing the hardware

136
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,639
not doing like programming on usual so

137
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,160
this is just a little bit of the history

138
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,759
of the UL x3s so this is the board like

139
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,400
here so you can see the size of the

140
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,180
board uh it's like done in collaboration

141
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,699
with faculty of electronics in the

142
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:06,960
Zagreb

143
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,479
so at one point we had like some

144
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,740
workshop with Arduino and that's

145
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,979
marcosets arrived at our workshops and

146
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,720
do some like simple things like

147
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,539
controlling all at this place and some

148
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:24,479
button switches and he already designed

149
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,319
the ulx 2s for the University to teach

150
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,560
students about the

151
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,319
digital logic and when he saw like Sim

152
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,759
how simple how simple Arduino is he

153
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,380
talked with the tower is this probably

154
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,020
is this maybe possible with the with the

155
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,300
fpga so they they actually started to

156
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,080
work first on the fpj Arduino so it was

157
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,520
like the

158
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,479
some core like Risk and MIP score inside

159
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,419
of the natural soft core inside of the

160
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:02,400
fpga and it was just controlled from the

161
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,220
Arduino so we could like put some

162
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,099
Arduino programming inside of this core

163
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:12,000
and it will it it will it runs and after

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,580
some time they started to talk about how

165
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,780
this

166
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,960
UL x2s board is like it is it was old it

167
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,319
used a smaller fpga so they started to

168
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,680
develop the new one like ul x3s and

169
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,979
adding more things to it so because the

170
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,060
old one

171
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,299
old one like was like here and it didn't

172
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,799
it didn't have like not VGA not many

173
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,200
things that I will show later it only

174
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,380
had like a video output like on one pin

175
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,060
for the like BNC and it had audio output

176
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,360
SD card USB few buttons

177
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,440
and a few LED switches and that version

178
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,959
was

179
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,800
with the SRAM so SRAM is quite easily

180
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,380
controllable with the fpga because it

181
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,779
doesn't lose the state so you can like

182
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,820
program you can put something in the

183
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,800
memory and it doesn't lose the memory

184
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,080
sdram is a bit different because the

185
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,959
memory is lost so you need to actually

186
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,000
refresh it constantly

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,959
and so hammer started to work on this

188
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,380
and uh after a few years it was all like

189
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,899
uh more like hobby project than

190
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,540
university project so it was like we are

191
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,720
helping from all the side sizes sites

192
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,660
and we have like we suggested something

193
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,540
he moved something and we we started

194
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,060
after a few years when it was like

195
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,680
completely done we started to do a crowd

196
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,459
Supply campaign and after that

197
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,180
campaign we we actually sold a lots of

198
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,180
boards and lots of community started to

199
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,459
work on on different types of projects

200
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,160
on the on the board

201
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,760
so the ulix 3s the main chip main chip

202
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,899
on the board is lattice ecp5

203
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,420
and so there are different types of

204
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,180
those chip and

205
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,339
UL x3s is supporting

206
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:20,399
almost all uh three eight five I think

207
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,420
it's three three something so around

208
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,760
three three eight one

209
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,779
pins and it is supporting all of those

210
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,200
381 because some pins are like or in

211
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,940
data sheet there is one thing like do

212
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,700
not use this pin break it to ground or

213
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,640
something but Emma discovered that he

214
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,220
can use pins and he can use just like

215
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,800
common pins and get those pin out pins

216
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,920
out so we can use like any any type of

217
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,959
of those we have like

218
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,640
it has lower uh like fpgas are all about

219
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,220
like memory and how my how many gates

220
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,160
they have so we have like version with

221
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,040
uh 12K of gates to the version of 85 ft

222
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,079
84 uh uh Gates and actually most of the

223
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,899
designs we are doing can be fitted in

224
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,560
those 12K but the most sellable board is

225
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,500
84k for some reason because people

226
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,660
always want like

227
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,140
quite a big board and biggest biggest is

228
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,220
better for themselves and this board can

229
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,079
only go with its Big B it's up to 64

230
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,300
megabytes

231
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,120
uh uh we can place different types of

232
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,880
sdrams we have checked with the lower

233
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,220
versions and different uh different

234
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,459
manufacturers it all works so it has the

235
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:55,100
sdram controller

236
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,920
sdram.chip and it has two micro USB

237
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,720
connectors

238
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,120
so the first connector is connected to

239
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,779
the ftdi chip and then ftdi chip is

240
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,459
connected to the lattice so we can

241
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:12,380
actually program the the fpga over the

242
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,740
the ftdi we also use this ftdi for the

243
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,820
serial interface and the second USB is

244
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,360
connected directly to the fpga so we can

245
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,600
use it like the for the host or we can

246
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,640
do some different things on that second

247
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,459
USB we can also do it like we can also

248
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:36,000
have USB bootloader on this second USB

249
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,720
Port so we have different types of

250
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,399
programming this board so we also have

251
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,339
JTAG pins we can program it over the

252
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,160
JTAG and on this board we have

253
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,380
placeholder for the small OLED display

254
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,100
so it's like I think it's SPI uh yeah

255
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,260
SPI all it

256
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,740
uh that can be fitted on the board we

257
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,920
have Micro SD card it's four bit we are

258
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,399
using just four four bit uh for bit

259
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,940
communication or SPI for for the for the

260
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,600
SD card we have eight LEDs and like

261
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,839
eight was the idea was to represent like

262
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,500
one byte so one byte so eight LEDs so

263
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,740
when you the problem is when you are

264
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,680
debugging actually the fpgas you don't

265
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,980
have like something like step-by-step

266
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,200
instructions so you can get like stop

267
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,019
and and get something back so most of

268
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,360
the time you are using sometimes like

269
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,300
you are using the LEDs for the debugging

270
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,079
so if things so you can attach the

271
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,940
signal to One LED and you can check if

272
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,579
that signal is changing it does it get

273
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:51,000
there what does it do so LEDs are quite

274
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,639
important on development board to

275
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,579
for the signal checking and

276
00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:01,019
uh we have the next thing we have like

277
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:04,139
it's video output and there is a really

278
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:07,760
bad problem with the like HDMI is uh

279
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,260
proprietary if you want to use HDMI you

280
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,360
need to comply with the regulation and

281
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,920
you need to

282
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,620
pay a lot to get the HDMI on the board

283
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,500
so we are using the HDMI connector but

284
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,639
the

285
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,200
we have called that thing the GP general

286
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,100
purpose differential interface and it's

287
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,700
actually using the DVI signal so DVI is

288
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,680
free and it can be used so we are using

289
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,399
DVI signal but most HDMI monitors are

290
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,380
actually

291
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,760
familiar with that signal and they can

292
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,220
like show the picture so it's almost

293
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,000
like HDMI but it is not

294
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,880
on the board we have the same connector

295
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,260
like on the ulix 2s so we have it it has

296
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,540
three pins so two pins are for audio

297
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,699
it's four bit audio so it's just a

298
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:04,680
simple uh resistor divider and one yeah

299
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,500
one pins is also like the video pin or

300
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,220
for whatever so we can have like BNC

301
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,860
video out on the board

302
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,000
uh we still like the UL H2S had like

303
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,019
good idea to be like the like uh like a

304
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:25,260
controller so on the ulx 3s actually we

305
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,779
imagined but it would be great if it it

306
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,779
will be like you can hold it and like uh

307
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,000
you have it like a controller that

308
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
already have everything inside so that's

309
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,100
why we have like seven buttons around

310
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,120
the board that are uh put like the

311
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,180
controller also yeah some deep switches

312
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,639
are you can always like when you are

313
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,620
doing some design you always have like

314
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,720
something you want like when the

315
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,540
something good you want to check if you

316
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,060
want this or this or dip switches are

317
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,459
quite useful we also have some simple

318
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,220
ADC on the board because

319
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,120
it was like Arduino has always those

320
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,100
potentiometers and stuff and some people

321
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,380
want to experiment with ADC it's not

322
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,019
super expensive or super quality you see

323
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,779
it's 12 bit ADC but eight actually eight

324
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:19,800
bits are useful and it is differential

325
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,440
so I think it has four uh four

326
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,199
differential channels or eight

327
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:27,540
single-ended channels for the for the

328
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,399
ADC

329
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,519
uh board has three power supply so

330
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,060
that's how the actually fpga's request

331
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,240
is like to have three power supply so it

332
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,459
has 3.3 volts 2.5 and 1.1 but for the

333
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:47,519
like 1.2 you would need for if you use

334
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,420
the uh

335
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,500
chip that has 5G like service but on

336
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,660
this board those are the spins are we

337
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,600
have just few pins out on the OLED

338
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,779
display but we never used them on on on

339
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,959
this board on the UL x3s

340
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,900
this is the ftdi chip so it's just doing

341
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,819
the uh JTAG stuff and the USB serial

342
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,780
nothing super special and when the fpga

343
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,980
boots

344
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,819
it doesn't have like any uh information

345
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,280
inside of it it needs to take the

346
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,079
information from somewhere and then

347
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,780
actually have that design put that

348
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,559
design uh inside so for that we have a

349
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,799
flash so board is actually booting for

350
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,340
from The Flash in some way so when it's

351
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,580
powered the fpgas take the bit stream

352
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,220
from The Flash and then it's uh loaded

353
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,100
inside we also have like some special

354
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,640
features on the board one is RTC and

355
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,660
like low power thing so we can if we are

356
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,940
using like RTC we can put the button

357
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,600
inside just to hold the clock uh without

358
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,000
the power supply

359
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,340
and we can actually set the timer to

360
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,620
wake up the board and then power off the

361
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,320
board so it doesn't consume it consumes

362
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,720
really a low amount of energy it's like

363
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,880
10 micrograms or something because

364
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,220
nothing is working actually just the RTC

365
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,520
is working and get and controlling one

366
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,500
line that will power up the board when

367
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,360
the time is when alarm is set

368
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,000
on the board so we wanted to have some

369
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,700
like microcontrollers so we can like

370
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,740
exchange some information with it and

371
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,600
like ESP is

372
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,919
was most popular and it gives us a lot

373
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,020
of options because it has the Wi-Fi

374
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,940
Bluetooth so it's like quite a cool uh

375
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,460
cool option for the fpga board we also

376
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,419
have a software for the currently the on

377
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,340
the ESP we have Micro python because

378
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,520
it's easier to write programs for it and

379
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,100
we also have the programs that ESP can

380
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,220
program the fpga because Emerald always

381
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,500
loves to work like on some remote

382
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,500
project so it's like we can like access

383
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,860
it remotely over the FTP or or something

384
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,260
and we can just send a new bit stream

385
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,200
and board will will have a new bit

386
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,419
stream on it

387
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:28,740
so the latest version is uh this uh this

388
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,820
is how how it looks

389
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,000
the actual from three one four I think

390
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,100
nothings for three one eight nothing

391
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,200
special did change we're just changing

392
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,419
like some simple stuff like adding the

393
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,580
filters or something so nothing

394
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,179
spectacular did change and the board is

395
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,100
completely open source from the start

396
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,100
and it is on the you can just search

397
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,600
your XDS on the GitHub it's Mr dual x3s

398
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,660
and the top side of the board I already

399
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,360
explained all those things but this is

400
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,000
like how they are placed we have few

401
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,280
more leads that are like describing when

402
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,400
the serial Port is uh doing something or

403
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,200
something

404
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,960
is uh done on like power lead and and we

405
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,620
also saw the maybe one important thing

406
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,620
is like we have those uh

407
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,780
those jumpers on 3.2 2.5 so fpgas can

408
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,799
can have like you can set the banks fpgs

409
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,559
is splitted in some banks and then those

410
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,740
Banks holding some pins and the Left

411
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,500
Bank and Left Bank voltage can be

412
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,380
changed with the changing of those uh

413
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,380
jumpers or resistors so we can all you

414
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,980
can add is your own voltage to to those

415
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,380
pins and you can get like whole Bank to

416
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,780
work non like 1.8 Volt or 2.5 or

417
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,760
3.3 volt

418
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,419
yeah this is a bottom side I think I I

419
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:08,160
stole everything about this yeah we have

420
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,860
lots of pinouts some are differential

421
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,520
some are not some are single-ended and

422
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,080
uh

423
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,799
and yes the call board is designed so

424
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:22,320
the pins are designed to be like p-mod

425
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,020
compatible so we can use P mods on on

426
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,940
this board

427
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,220
and yes we started the campaign and

428
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,620
campaign was really successful we we

429
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,840
didn't think that it would be so popular

430
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,320
so it was like our goal was uh

431
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,080
like 10 times and we got to 10 times

432
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,220
more and like we delivered the last year

433
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,980
we delivered all the boards so we first

434
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,400
formed the company then got money and

435
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,500
then we bought everything needed and

436
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,840
then we started to Preparing like

437
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,880
production and everything

438
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,220
and the complete production of the UL

439
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,840
x3s is done in in Croatia so it's

440
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,659
so we have first batch was done by a

441
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,179
Concha so we had some deals with them so

442
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,640
they did one thousand boards uh

443
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,380
one thousand first one thousand boards

444
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,260
they they did it uh they assembled it in

445
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,600
concert and after that so for this they

446
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,120
do just big batches so after that we

447
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,039
switched to smaller companies but they

448
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,500
are also in Croatia and last batch is

449
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,980
from uh drivers and Motors they are in

450
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,220
istria and they are doing like batches

451
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,100
of 100 200 boards and they are doing

452
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,260
actually the first boards for from the

453
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,179
concert so I bought the parts and they

454
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,120
assembled it and now the drivers and

455
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,580
motors are are doing everything so they

456
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,600
are I just tell them I want 100 or 200

457
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,580
words that they are actually buying

458
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,860
parts and they do complete assembly

459
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:00,480
testing and uh and packing

460
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,120
and this is a video from the campaign

461
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,340
because there is lots of things around

462
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,580
this board and lots of projects so I

463
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,980
don't want to talk that much so I will

464
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,500
just start the video from the campaign

465
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,260
so you can see it uh live it's working

466
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,520
but maybe I can put the sound out I

467
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,418
don't know it's not

468
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:36,000
just a second I will try to get the

469
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,179
sound

470
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,140
sound

471
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,720

thank you

486
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,580
so yes you saw the we are using the open

487
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,919
source tool chain and big thanks to

488
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,080
yours is HQ for

489
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,039
this because yeah it was like

490
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,440
our board would never be so popular if

491
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,779
we are not using the open source tool

492
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,779
chain so the lattice has its own Tool

493
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:23,220
It's called The Diamond

494
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,659
but uh yeah for us like

495
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:32,039
using the open sources like priority

496
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,320
and yeah after campaign we needed to

497
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,840
because ngos in Croatia cannot sell the

498
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,640
board so we needed to open a company

499
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,980
that will

500
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,799
uh that will do the distribution and

501
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,440
after that we started with like doing

502
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,220
other things and with like all those

503
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,820
projects are always open source

504
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,220
so one of those projects is was like

505
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,179
Firefly not just one

506
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,919
it's just a simple board that is doing

507
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,220
something Sim like we have our own

508
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,799
protocol but like similar like damix so

509
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,980
we needed to cover one uh big

510
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,900
a big

511
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,440
big museum with uh with some lights so

512
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,080
those are all like controllable RGB

513
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,700
lights and they are doing like

514
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,159
presentation of

515
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,260
stars and like something water something

516
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,659
but it's like completely custom projects

517
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:30,720
made from zero to to finish

518
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,299
I'm also helping the Paul with the

519
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:36,779
megaphone project so it's like

520
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:40,860
also completely open source project

521
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,900
and after those batches on the

522
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,340
drivers and Motors who are finished a

523
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,559
big actually first batches and the

524
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,419
Contra when those were finished the

525
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,059
concert didn't want to do some tests do

526
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:55,799
the testing of the board so I did do

527
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,500
that by myself and you probably know

528
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,539
dobrics are he is often guessed here and

529
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:07,200
he did some scripting and did some like

530
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,039
batch testing for me so the he designed

531
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,360
some he programs on scripts for uh

532
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,279
like programming Trend words like I'm

533
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,919
just plugging the USB and those boards

534
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,760
are just getting all tested done and and

535
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,799
everything so it's quite a light show

536
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,960
when I'm doing that

537
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,539
but after that time actually I was

538
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,779
talking to the production companies and

539
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,539
they always want like script is for me

540
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,520
scripts are really cool and I can do

541
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,679
everything in scripts but when you send

542
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,260
the boards to some company that is

543
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,120
producing the board they are always like

544
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,260
they they like guys and so I talked with

545
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,320
the nvox so that's also the company that

546
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,419
is doing all Open Source Hardware and

547
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,720
the software and for me they they just

548
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,640
checked the scripts and they they had

549
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,240
new thing like it's called easy flow and

550
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,179
they completely redesigned the testing

551
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,220
scripts now we have like complete GUI

552
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,000
for the batch testing of the boards

553
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,340
and

554
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,700
and they are actually those flow is part

555
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,760
of the easy Studio it's also open source

556
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,279
project and it's really huge and

557
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,880
enormously good project it's so they are

558
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,640
doing like the

559
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,919
modular power supply

560
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,260
so it's fully a modular power supply but

561
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,840
the day started so when you're designing

562
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,720
some guise actually if you start to

563
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,580
write the code and if you use some

564
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,940
proprietary uh GUI thing it can change

565
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,960
and yeah it is quite complex so they

566
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,899
actually started to build the studio for

567
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:54,120
Designing the guise so they actually

568
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,200
built first they uh Road uh easy studio

569
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,440
and then in the studio studio they they

570
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,799
actually designed complete GUI interface

571
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,039
for that power supply and inside of that

572
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:12,260
studio is also controlling of the uh

573
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,659
so you can control any skip with Skippy

574
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:17,820
command you can control any measuring

575
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,360
equipment and then actually they uh they

576
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,760
try to like if you want to automatize

577
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,380
something with the measuring equipment

578
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,320
then the best way was to design this

579
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,140
flow so you can use the graphical

580
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,200
interface and some flow nice flow

581
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,440
Graphics to to avoid like direct

582
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,899
programming or direct scripting

583
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,539
and and I have a latest thing they have

584
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,240
like they support different types of

585
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,299
boards so this is like my something with

586
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:51,179
the with their studio so I designed like

587
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:54,779
uh just a simple flow that is doing some

588
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,779
but uh button things and I press the

589
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:01,080
reset instead of the button but so it's

590
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,760
like

591
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,000
like I can control hardware and I just

592
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,940
did everything in the in the GUI

593
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,299
so it's quite cool open source project

594
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:15,120
and as for the UL League samples there

595
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,460
is enormous amount of samples and

596
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,340
enormous amount of things people do as

597
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,620
you saw in the video it's like retro

598
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,960
Computing Retro Gaming

599
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,799
some security stuff like the is

600
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,220
something SPI it's somewhere here uh but

601
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,399
uh yeah the best startup point is like

602
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:39,000
uh your x3s GitHub IO so we have the

603
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,640
list of the most of the projects we can

604
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,820
find and we change that list often when

605
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,820
the something's new arrives

606
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,679
and uh

607
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,000
that startup gives you like the links to

608
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,480
the emerald like simple

609
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,320
simple design so every every piece of

610
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,520
the hardware is actually already

611
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,840
supported so so you have like PS2 USBS

612
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:12,480
audio sdram DVI whatever we have we

613
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,240
already have startup points for for your

614
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,740
projects

615
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,320
I'm also designing like open source

616
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,120
not everywhere no not every is the

617
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,860
remote compatible but the board like

618
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,140
extension boards for the UL x3s so

619
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,240
because on the Oberon project you saw

620
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,059
that one I need like two USBs for the

621
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,700
mouse and keyboard also for the minimig

622
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,159
like Amiga projects I need to to

623
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,100
controllers like two PS2 controllers so

624
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,679
I designed this USB to have actually

625
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,980
three when I plug this in and we

626
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,760
designed this gpdi input output pmote so

627
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,080
we can

628
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,919
we can have like something like DVI

629
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,380
input but the problem with the input

630
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,500
with DVI input is that you need to like

631
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,960
synchronize all the the signals that are

632
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,480
entering into the board so we are still

633
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,239
synchronizing that with moving face on

634
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:13,020
the like red clock and something but it

635
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,080
and it's not super high resolution so

636
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,679
you can do like six 640 by 480 so it's

637
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,379
just a simple proof of concept that we

638
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,560
can do like uh

639
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,300
then some overlay on the picture then

640
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,800
put the picture out on the second

641
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,080
gpdi and this is like simplest thing

642
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,000
it's like OV 7670 camera

643
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,500
extension board it's just for we can

644
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,139
support like two cameras on the board

645
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,839
and you can get pictures from both of

646
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,520
those

647
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,418
and yeah boards are sometimes available

648
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:54,060
unfortunately this chip shortages like

649
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,140
killing every other thing so boards some

650
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,660
boards are sometimes available on Mauser

651
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,960
and sometimes available at 10 bookstore

652
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,500
but now I also have problem with the

653
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,040
with like EMC and stuff and I need to

654
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,160
certify the real x3s So currently you

655
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,680
cannot buy if you are in EU or UK you

656
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,320
cannot buy the boards from Mauser you

657
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,180
need to use the inbox

658
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,500
store

659
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,200
and yeah story with 10 volkswag we

660
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,480
started to talk with the bed scripting

661
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,359
and something so we wanted actually to

662
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:32,099
combine so we

663
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:36,119
uh we so they have like uh powerful

664
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:39,119
power supply and we have the fpga so we

665
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,780
wanted something in between so fpgs can

666
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,420
do like uh a lot of more signal

667
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,060
processing and so we had an idea to

668
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,099
combine those two things and to get

669
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:52,859
something out of it so we started to

670
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,740
work on one uh uh project that was

671
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,440
actually combining the fpga and the STM

672
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,160
and on these projects STM picture is

673
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,240
overlaid on on top of the fpga picture

674
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,700
so we can do like everything that they

675
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,700
have so complete

676
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,220
studio and something and we can overlay

677
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,820
that on top of the uh like Scorpio

678
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,619
project you saw so we can have like

679
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,960
something like open source oscilloscope

680
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,619
but the main problem here was

681
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:28,440
like especially today some parts are not

682
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,839
available so we had lots of problems

683
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:34,020
like SDM so and we have lots of problems

684
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,000
to build this board so we designed it

685
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,119
but now it's a problematic to get a

686
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,020
so we decided to go actually modular to

687
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,540
have like modular board

688
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,839
and that we can when someone ask us to

689
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:51,240
combine projects and something we can

690
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,420
like just use our modular board and just

691
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,660
use the pin out for

692
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,700
uh just do the pin out on their design

693
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,560
or or similar

694
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,599
so we are collaborating in many projects

695
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,839
but the uh most important is probably

696
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,380
the sandbox stuff and yeah we wanted to

697
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,040
actually to have simple pin out with all

698
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,040
pins out and we have checked like what

699
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,800
is what are the possibilities

700
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,740
and we needed to switch like on to six

701
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,140
layer board not four so everything like

702
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,020
gets more and more expensive so we asked

703
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,599
the annulate foundation if they would

704
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:34,079
like support us and to have multiple uh

705
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,320
modular boards and they said yes they

706
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,960
were they will and they are supporting

707
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,200
us also right now to do different stuff

708
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,960
with those modular boards and inside of

709
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,660
this uh support grants we also have the

710
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,280
opportunity to experiment with blender

711
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,480
so we can combine like art and uh and uh

712
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,119
and electronics

713
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,700
so this is from blender so Paula is from

714
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,760
Paula from radiona is doing all the

715
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,680
blender things so we started with the

716
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,440
simple things and then doing like uh

717
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,500
more complex and complex

718
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,839
first pictures then videos

719
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,599
so we will we will probably use this

720
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:22,079
latest videos in the new campaign for

721
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,820
the the small board

722
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,040
so this is also like the picture from

723
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,119
the

724
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,280
from the blender

725
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,920
so we can use that it's also cool when

726
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,380
you have like ideas or something to have

727
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,720
the board first in like virtual

728
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,380
environment like in blender or or free

729
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,500
cat so you can just check the dimensions

730
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,760
of the board

731
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,420
because this board is

732
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,000
is having the really small like

733
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,980
connectors and first thing we had like

734
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,260
before we started with the blender I had

735
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,300
the problem like one millimeter was

736
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,780
board was one millimeter off the so it

737
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,359
wasn't like clicking on the board and

738
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,800
yeah we started to experiment in

739
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,000
checking what would be like Pro proper

740
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,540
connector for our stuff and

741
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,359
the we checked the few connectors and

742
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,180
like we saw the connector that is used

743
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,440
by the Raspberry Pi cm4 connector and it

744
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,540
was quite cheap connector so we decided

745
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,240
to go with that one and also when we

746
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,460
started to work with that connector it

747
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,740
was it would be stupid to not to use

748
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,160
actually the cm4 pinout so now we are

749
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,220
actually doing the board that is

750
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,920
actually cm4 compatible so we can use

751
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,160
any baseboard that is actually Raspberry

752
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,180
Pi cm4 i o compatible so that's the good

753
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,839
feature for this board

754
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:53,579
uh yeah this presentation is a bit old

755
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:56,460
basically because now the versions are I

756
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,380
am now on the

757
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,339
ulx 4M so there are two versions like LD

758
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:06,660
and LS LS version is sdram so because we

759
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,060
want to preserve compatibility to

760
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:13,260
ulx 3s and sdram is mostly used in retro

761
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,320
gamings and some things are even like

762
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,619
probably not possible with DDR memory

763
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:21,720
so we are still preserving like the

764
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,480
version with the sdram but we wanted to

765
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,200
add more to to a new board so new board

766
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,020
will also have the option for the DDR3

767
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,839
memory and that board will also have the

768
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,440
those third spins connected to to

769
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,780
connector

770
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,740
yeah the I don't think this is like the

771
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,680
newest so now we have uh on the board so

772
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,460
this is the newest this is the

773
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:53,280
ldv2 now I'm doing V3 I'm sending the

774
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,920
design of LD V3 and the lsv2 but now we

775
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,859
have like Health LEDs uh on the board

776
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:06,060
like three buttons uh we have the one

777
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,420
gigabit Ethernet chip

778
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,180
and we have the like I added the USB

779
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,579
connector so it can be used without the

780
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:17,280
baseboard so that was a request from the

781
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,220
users yeah yeah the the important maybe

782
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,960
important stuff is what we want to

783
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,420
experiment with it has the connections

784
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,740
to the uh CSI uh for the camera

785
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,440
interface so we can control two cameras

786
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,720
on this board and that's quite important

787
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,640
if you want like stereo Vision things

788
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,260
and like

789
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,320
to get pictures from the cameras and to

790
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,560
put the pictures in the the DDR and to

791
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,700
do some math on the pictures and we can

792
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,520
support one I will see if second is

793
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,420
possible DSC so far to more display and

794
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,740
we have two DVI outputs we have PCI

795
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,839
Express and uh yeah lots of different

796
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,940
things and yes this DDR3 actually is uh

797
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:12,000
latest work is actually supporting uh

798
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,359
fully open source uh Linux so we can

799
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,980
actually boot Linux on it and uh

800
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,380
yeah those are the layers on the it's

801
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,520
quite dense and it's even more dense now

802
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,460
because I add like step by step I'm

803
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,619
adding some features to the board so

804
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:34,260
board has like three

805
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,800
uh three signal layers and two ground

806
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,680
layers and one power layer

807
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,500
and it's like those are just signal

808
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:48,200
layers so those are three signal layers

809
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,839
okay and yeah we are compatible with all

810
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,180
cm4 uh

811
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,700
uh baseboard so there are lots of word

812
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,700
outs out there that we are

813
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,819
that we are compatible so here I have

814
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:04,480
like something

815
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,640
[Music]

816
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,240
like GPI case too so it's

817
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,700
UL x3s inside and it's completely like

818
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:15,660
doing the the nas emulator and it's

819
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,099
actually the

820
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:20,400
like completely like handheld devices

821
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,839
with just our board and and in the case

822
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,400
from the

823
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,619
from the internet

824
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:32,220
it's also we also are talking with the

825
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,579
like cutie pie tablet they want to use

826
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:39,000
our board for the for the tablet so but

827
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,660
we need to support like those DSi are

828
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,780
really crazy so we I have tested and I

829
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,280
can get the picture from the camera

830
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,060
that's like

831
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,960
and those tablets are using DSi screens

832
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,060
so DSi is quite complex to doing

833
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:00,119
hardware and I think it's some part of

834
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:02,640
those are proprietary so we will need to

835
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,599
check how to get the picture on the LCD

836
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:09,720
I'm also doing some like experiment with

837
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,160
the baltazar foundation so they want to

838
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,079
uh they want to create some like open

839
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,380
source double laptop

840
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:21,240
something like m t reform but they want

841
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,400
it like simpler so the idea is

842
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,940
completely to simplify it and so I'm

843
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,480
doing the design so it can fit the ulx

844
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,560
4M or cm4 module so the user can can

845
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,099
choose between those two

846
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:40,440
and yes this is actually the booting of

847
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,560
the on the DDR3 memory this is the

848
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,900
booting of the of the Linux

849
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,900
so it's not super extremely fast but it

850
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,000
is like down to last transistor open

851
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,700
source Linux boot so that's the

852
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,400
important part

853
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,579
it also has the frame buffer so we can

854
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:09,480
push something in that frame buffer

855
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,260
okay I don't know

856
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,800
and just to copying some image to uh to

857
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,440
me from the SD card to a media so I can

858
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,339
just

859
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:31,339
push the picture to a frame buffer

860
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:35,579
nothing super special but just shows

861
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:38,960
that frame buffer is working

862
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,339
yeah so that's that show on the HDMI

863
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:48,119
port so you can see the picture on the

864
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:52,440
and it can also have the X but X but

865
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,599
it's like

866
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:56,280
yeah it's

867
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,440
it's proof of concept it's not like you

868
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,740
will run Debian soon on that but you can

869
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,319
have that it's

870
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,740
and yeah you can random that's the most

871
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:12,240
important part of the thing

872
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:16,500
and yes that's it so here are like my

873
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,680
contacts we are on Jitter Discord you

874
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,020
will find me radio now or like

875
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,579
Intergalactic we write article for like

876
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:28,859
analnet we for each Grant we write one

877
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:31,619
article so you can check the news on The

878
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:34,319
Intergalactic we have like everything

879
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,380
there so blender stuff all the designs

880
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,319
of the ulex Forum and everything we do

881
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,700
is like on in the news channel so thank

882
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,410
you

883
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:55,260
[Applause]

884
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,240
yeah questions

885
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,500
are there any questions

886
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,119
uh hello thank you for your presentation

887
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:16,079
it was very nice so two questions first

888
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,520
is the ulx 3 available I see it kinda is

889
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,160
on the the on the on the crowd Supply

890
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,160
page and how that actually works now if

891
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,460
I want to buy one and the second one uh

892
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,380
you gathered a lot of money for your

893
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,560
crowd Supply and you had to like make a

894
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,500
company in your country so did your

895
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,720
government let you have all your money

896
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,660
or did they took some taxes there and

897
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,359
how that actually works in practice yeah

898
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,900
thanks yes boards are available on mouse

899
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,660
or crowd Supply and the inbox but on the

900
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,359
mouse there and crowd Supply they will

901
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:57,060
not ship to Europe so that's the problem

902
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,480
because we are not we didn't sign those

903
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,540
EMC thing with like I need to do the

904
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,280
measurements of the board and

905
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,160
measurements are expensive so that's the

906
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,400
thing and for the money yeah you will

907
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,980
get taxed for everything in Croatia so

908
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,760
yeah we received so there is no text I

909
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,520
received like money in advance so they

910
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,040
don't tax that so you don't like need to

911
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,380
pay tax on that but when you sell the

912
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,180
board then you will pay like I think

913
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,780
it's 10 if you have some uh profit on it

914
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,260
but we are like low on profit we are not

915
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:37,680
uh extremely profit because I am working

916
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,319
there alone I'm getting just my salary

917
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,040
and we are not like extremely profitable

918
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,900
we are sustainable but not extremely

919
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,420
profitable so it's not so so much of the

920
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,300
tax so most of the things goes on like

921
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,520
my salary and tax on my salary so it's

922
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,900
not so

923
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,720
so bad but at the end so we calculated

924
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,960
like we wanted it was still like those

925
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,780
prices are really look really high but

926
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,819
from those prices we calculated that we

927
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:11,040
need like 20 of uh get 20 of those but

928
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,880
the latest like results show we get like

929
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,640
seven percent from one like selling so

930
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,900
it's not

931
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,359
it's actually nothing so it's like the

932
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:25,380
but the main actually for the company we

933
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,440
we don't have like Hardware selling as a

934
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,960
main thing so we are actually selling

935
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,500
the designs and work on designs and

936
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,440
that's the main thing on the company so

937
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,339
like the also we get money from the

938
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:42,660
internet for the research and

939
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,000
development that's the like that's

940
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,180
really cool thing and uh and I'm getting

941
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,540
paid for like uh things to do with other

942
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:54,000
open source projects so that's the main

943
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,760
main income in the companies from the

944
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,500
service not from the selling of the

945
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,700
hardware so

946
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,460
yeah

947
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,880
any more questions

948
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,859
no one

949
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,460
yeah

950
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,819
no okay just one more thing I forget so

951
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:19,920
this year we will probably have the

952
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,560
campaign for the ulx Forum so we will

953
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,780
have two versions uh one will be like

954
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,819
cheaper for retro gamings and second

955
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:29,400
will be probably extremely expensive

956
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,339
because just the chip is now I think 80

957
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:35,700
Euros so just the ECP five it said this

958
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:41,040
5G is like uh at around 80 85 Euros so

959
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,020
and lattice doesn't give the discount

960
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:46,980
for the quantities you have like uh like

961
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,040
few bucks a little lower upper but it's

962
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,500
like you can do many boards but you can

963
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,240
still you still need to pay for those

964
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,660
acp5 and the main problem is that ACP

965
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,940
wait time is now year and a half so you

966
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,339
need to pay everything in advance and

967
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:05,040
wait for a year and a half to do the

968
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,740
production then you can like sell the

969
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,540
boards and get the money that's the

970
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,839
current Hardware problem yeah but yeah

971
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:14,050
thank you

972
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:17,890
