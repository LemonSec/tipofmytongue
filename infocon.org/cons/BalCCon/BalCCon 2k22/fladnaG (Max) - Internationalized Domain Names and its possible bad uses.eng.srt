00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,680
[Music]

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,520
thank you

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,180
[Music]

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,130
hello hello everyone

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,920
[Applause]

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,360
so

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,880
um yes my name is Max I'm French I'm a

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,399
French independent pen tester trainer

10
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,840
and sysadmin

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,460
and I'm going to talk about maybe

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,800
something that you already know or maybe

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,440
something that you don't know is

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,140
internationalized domain names mainly

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,820
how they work what's the problem they

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,520
are trying to solve and how can it be

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,440
possibly bad

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,760
ly used by Bad actors or by maybe red

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,680
teams rating people

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,459
to uh to achieve great things right so

21
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,520
let's get started so a little disclaimer

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,260
to start

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,540
um don't have the dumbs like me we'll

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,040
see I've done something really stupid

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,320
because the French authorities are not

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,960
very uh to be played with we'll talk

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,420
about this later uh what will be

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,580
presented here may be considered illegal

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,380
in some countries

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,659
um because it's in the same family we'll

31
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,000
talk about it same family as a typo

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,020
squatting

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,000
so it might be a problem and it might

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,820
send you to jail so be careful and this

35
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,380
is not a point on shame presentation

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,860
because everyone is vulnerable

37
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,560
yes that's a problem and the goal here

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,920
is to talk to you people the good people

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,939
the I.T people that we have to to talk

40
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,159
about this this issue because

41
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,079
I think in the in a few years it would

42
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,299
be a show

43
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,860
um so what are we going to talk about I

44
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,299
think I will go quickly on in quick

45
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,880
introduction to them in names because

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,060
I think everyone knows the basics of

47
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,758
domain names I will not need much more

48
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,800
than that we talk about idns and

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,940
punicode

50
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,920
we're gonna play a game as well nothing

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,340
to win but maybe yeah maybe a small

52
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,260
bottle of right here if you're if you're

53
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,420
very nice we'll talk about attacks in

54
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,180
the wild so some historical examples and

55
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,959
my dumb stupid idea and zomography decks

56
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,260
and I'm gonna demo one of them and then

57
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,459
we'll talk about how to protect

58
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,680
ourselves because well yeah it would be

59
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,860
great so domain names

60
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,319
um domain names is very very old and in

61
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,319
fact the syntax of domain names which is

62
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:48,120
a to z 0 to 9 and the minus is really

63
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,019
old and is dating back to arpanet and

64
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:54,900
hosts.txt file shared vitp us names

65
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,000
online RFC I don't remember the number

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,599
from the 80s

67
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,720
early early 80s so the DNS goal is to

68
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,580
mentally translate domain names into IP

69
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,300
addresses or configuration

70
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,420
uh texts Etc so these are called records

71
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,180
organized as a tree based search and

72
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,420
consultation so it's easy to find

73
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,300
so always read right to left and this is

74
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,920
something that many many many people

75
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,140
don't understand is come

76
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,980
best rakia 3w we'll talk about best

77
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,580
rakia later there is a rakia theme in my

78
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,580
slides today so hopefully you will find

79
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,220
interesting so all this because it's

80
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,159
using all their FCS and all norms for

81
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,220
naming machines are all ASCII uh

82
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,459
characters and maybe you see where I'm

83
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,980
going with this

84
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,019
um three people that are important in

85
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,440
the DNS uh in the DNS world is the

86
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,120
registry the company Foundation

87
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,340
Administration governing the TLD the

88
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,580
extension of the domain name if you will

89
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,920
the registrar which is the company where

90
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,560
end users can register their names

91
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,220
uh it's as the first asked first serve

92
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,980
basis so be quick

93
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,380
uh it's a Regency proxy and the

94
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,600
registrant is yourself trying to train

95
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,120
to register a domain name

96
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,340
what so what are International's domain

97
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,020
names we all know domain name so what

98
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,160
are they

99
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,620
in fact there are they have been created

100
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,960
because there is a problem not every

101
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,440
language on the planet is using a to z

102
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,800
alphabet ask the alphabet yeah yeah

103
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,160
strange right yeah for example you know

104
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,900
Serbian people here should should know

105
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,139
that uh so if only there was a uni

106
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,560
virtual way to encode all characters

107
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,120
from all character sets from all

108
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,639
longitudes in the world yes

109
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,800
um and so

110
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,780
they created what is called punicode

111
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,020
punicode is a way of encoding

112
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,360
they say exotic I'm an exotic myself

113
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,639
because French people French characters

114
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,620
have accents as well so let's call

115
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,580
nonesky as exotic a way to encode exotic

116
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,740
characters without breaking the current

117
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,259
way DNS is working it's kind of the act

118
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,380
of the DNS if you want so International

119
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,220
domain names look like this you have the

120
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,520
xxn dash dash then if there is an ASCII

121
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,680
part it will be here with a dash at the

122
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,440
end of the ASCII part and then the puny

123
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,800
code so I've done some example here with

124
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,380
um I was not inspired so I don't know

125
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,600
Nicola Tesla

126
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,820
uh you have the Unicode one so the

127
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,699
beautiful one the please please do the

128
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,000
eyes and the ASCII punicoded one so

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,759
what's funny is the second one if you

130
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,400
can see all the second one are all 30

131
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,660
characters

132
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,120
except for the dashes

133
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,680
so you have xn dash dash dash dash dash

134
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,960
Dash because it's the the end of the

135
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,180
ASCII part and then the punicode

136
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,220
punicode I would not talk about the math

137
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,620
behind punicode because it's state

138
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,360
machine thing I don't want to do math

139
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,320
okay right I'm not rakiolic uh last uh

140
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,780
last night was hard so no Mass no match

141
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,900
today but but anyway so this is a way to

142
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,180
encode and in fact in this code that you

143
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,100
have at the end you have the position of

144
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,560
the characters and the Unicode uh

145
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,020
character that must be inserted in this

146
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,580
place on the text

147
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,639
all right so it's the same for emoji if

148
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,360
you remember from Mac lemon presentation

149
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,940
uh 2019 emojis can be combined as well

150
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,940
and this works as well so in fact if you

151
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,220
remember the Pirates lag

152
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,740
is in fact a dark flag plus

153
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,340
um

154
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,840
that's called yeah

155
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,000
and it works as well in fact you have

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,120
both codes behind the X and dash dash

157
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,919
oh is everything all right for everybody

158
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,319
right now okay you understand at least a

159
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,000
bit how it works

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,600
Okay so

161
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,319
does any TLD registry allows this kind

162
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,780
of domains to be registered yes very

163
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,440
signed.com registry allows many Unicode

164
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,500
subcar sub Char sets um but you have to

165
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,400
choose

166
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,000
a main alphabet before and then you will

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,740
have a subset of Unicode that you will

168
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,020
be able to choose from

169
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,599
um there are many many many documents on

170
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,880
very sign website it's a pain in the ass

171
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,300
to read Kinda Yeah you have a link here

172
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,460
but it's kind of Penny yes I'm going to

173
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,020
take the example because I'm French of

174
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,060
what the association the foundation

175
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,720
ethnic it's the registry for DOT FR

176
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,639
which is the cctld of my country and we

177
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,520
have some accented characters

178
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,400
so you have all characters allowed here

179
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,699
so then you may ask why is the asset in

180
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,599
the list the double s drunk double s

181
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,199
from Germans and alterations as well

182
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,740
um why because of local languages in

183
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,940
fact I'm from

184
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,419
um North East North East of France so in

185
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,880
Loren and um

186
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,099
the language and sometimes the local

187
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,680
language the Laura

188
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,340
um

189
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,020
picks some

190
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,259
alphabet from the neighbor country and

191
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,419
previous owner of the region but that's

192
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,000
another story we're gonna talk about it

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,120
now so yes so how does it look in a

194
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,740
browser I don't know if you can see it

195
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,958
well no it's bit small the other ones

196
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,399
you'll see better

197
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,559
um it looks fine in your browser you'll

198
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,300
see a bit later

199
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,880
because I can't you know the steam deck

200
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,100
I would not be able to zoom right or

201
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,620
come on okay

202
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,200
but in fact you'll see under the address

203
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,399
bar a

204
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,740
rexmorgas.gfelson.org this is the this

205
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,779
is the domain name shown in the address

206
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:08,040
bar and beside it xn dash dash you have

207
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,320
the you have the the puny code encoded

208
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,800
level of of the subdomain right is that

209
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,260
okay for you you can see it in um Bold

210
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,540
characters right so it works in Chrome

211
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,600
and Firefox and in fact any browsers any

212
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,820
browser today because the the norm is

213
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,540
old now idn says 2003 that was

214
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,480
standardized uh so it's a bit bit old

215
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,320
now

216
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,240
so

217
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,540
does anybody notice a problem already no

218
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,420
yes yes we'll see we'll see we'll play a

219
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,399
game and we'll see if you if you have

220
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,620
the problem so let's play a game so

221
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,820
let's say

222
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,980
that I have something

223
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,860
maybe for you to earn but I'm gonna talk

224
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,019
at the same time yeah I'm gonna show you

225
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,420
two shower types right

226
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,880
and uh you will have to guess which

227
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,500
this from

228
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,980
left or right you're right wait

229
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,320
and the price

230
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,779
oh no I don't get it the price of the

231
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,220
shutter rackhead the bar

232
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,019
I don't I don't have the small Butters

233
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,260
anymore so

234
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,100
one is Cyrillic so from Unicode and the

235
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,380
other one is Latin

236
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,740
from ASCII which one which

237
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,000
can you guess

238
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,100
it's it's a dumb game because because

239
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,320
there is no way on this one to know

240
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,600
which one's which right now there is no

241
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,180
way I have I don't know yes you can see

242
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,519
it a bit the Firefox screenshot as well

243
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,120
you can't see the difference at all

244
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,519
right so does anybody want to play

245
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,160
Unicode left or right

246
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,860
left Unicode left

247
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,100
no ASCII left

248
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,100
uh yes but yeah okay you want to play

249
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,140
you will not win you will not win you

250
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,860
excluded from the game right

251
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,959
so yes uh ASCII on the left and serenity

252
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,450
on the right okay this one

253
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,279
[Music]

254
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,860
so one is Greek from Unicode and the

255
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,380
other one is ASCII Latin classic one

256
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,560
which one's which so if you look closely

257
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,640
you'll see that

258
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,480
I'm not the same

259
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,459
not the same one is straight and the

260
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,800
other one is rounded which one's which

261
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,320
is Greek on the left

262
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,079
or on the right

263
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,480
raise your raise your hands if you think

264
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,760
it's on the right if Greek is on the

265
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,880
right

266
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,820
okay okay so tell tell this to Microsoft

267
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,100
charm app because that's where I get it

268
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,339
from

269
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,560
yeah yeah okay okay I will send an email

270
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,600
uh I don't have the contacts but I will

271
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,339
send you an email I will send them an

272
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:59,660
email so from what I saw from charm up

273
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,339
ASCII is on the left and Greek is on the

274
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,560
right so if people choose Greek on the

275
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,839
right you were you were on the on the

276
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,079
good side so this one is easy just have

277
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,800
to focus one is Latin extended and the

278
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,079
other one is

279
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:18,420
latinaski standard so

280
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:24,660
on the uh is Latin extended on the left

281
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,779
yeah or on the right

282
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,760
no you have bad eyes

283
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,060
um you don't make you have bad eyes I

284
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,560
have to tell you this

285
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,720
um yes it's on the left because it's um

286
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,320
it's capital I with the dots and small

287
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,079
uh I without the dot so it's not

288
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,540
standard so yes no this one is easy

289
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,019
right so this one is this one is funny

290
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,839
so do you know what the diet trick is

291
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,180
dire trick is like an accent accent is

292
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,600
uh sub-family of a dietary is something

293
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,300
you combine with a standard letter like

294
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,019
um like C when you put this under or the

295
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,380
you have the Reversed um hat on the I

296
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,700
don't know I don't know how to say it in

297
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,399
English so Riverside you got it okay so

298
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,040
that trick is this all right accents so

299
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,620
which one which

300
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,019
is dietary on the left

301
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,380
no on the on the right oh all right but

302
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,700
there is a trick with this one because

303
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,320
if you think this one is dumb you're not

304
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,519
you're not ready for what you're going

305
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,079
to see so yes the diet trick is on the

306
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,700
right and you have to combine it

307
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,980
with another characters

308
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,600
like right here

309
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,540
and the problem is at some point

310
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,959
it's kinda hard to look at the diatrick

311
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,720
if the leather is going far at the

312
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,339
bottom of the line

313
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,920
so you can combine characters can you

314
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,779
see now where I'm getting so this one is

315
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:49,800
easy

316
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,660
this is the last one I know I don't help

317
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,620
you

318
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,420
do you know

319
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,980
the difference is what are the two

320
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,480
letters here

321
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,279
yeah

322
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,139
which one was which by the way

323
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,160
yes left is L why

324
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,800
it's longer and it's uh it's uh it's

325
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,459
it's uh it's thinner yeah of course so I

326
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:15,000
think yeah you got the problem right is

327
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,279
that we can

328
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,779
visually

329
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:21,480
maybe registered other domain names that

330
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,360
just look like the right one but I'm not

331
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,320
the right one

332
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,920
so

333
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,839
um this this kind of attacks are called

334
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,720
homograph attacks and there are

335
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,700
categories of typo squatting attacks

336
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,079
which is a generic term for silver

337
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,700
squatting and brainjacking domain names

338
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,639
so you can use butt spilling plural

339
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,860
instead of singular different Cc or tlds

340
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,940
homographic attacks you also have combo

341
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,380
combo squatting attacks so common

342
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,720
squatting is quite easy to understand I

343
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,180
will uh I will register a website called

344
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,220
Apple

345
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,920
um Apple customer service.com

346
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,620
you see you add words at the end for

347
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,000
people to believe it's the official it's

348
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,560
official in the names so it should be

349
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,940
official right

350
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,000
yeah yeah and the other one is the

351
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,399
doppelganger domain so let's say that

352
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,180
you have a domain called

353
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,240
3w.bestrakia.com you will Reserve

354
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,160
freewbastrakia.com you you remove the

355
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,100
dash right so it looks kind of the same

356
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,440
right okay

357
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,139
so as this kind of attacks already

358
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,800
happened in the wild yes yes it has

359
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,839
happened and there was a demo from a

360
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,440
Chinese researchers Deng on 2017 with

361
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,199
apple.com what you don't see here is

362
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,380
that the a is seritic a

363
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,440
and it was not the Apple website it was

364
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,959
a page explaining the attack and how to

365
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,160
protect so it was really funny right

366
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,440
um Microsoft is not helping as well with

367
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,639
emails for example uh somebody called

368
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,519
W1 Kenobi we don't have all all the

369
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,660
choice on our on our synonyms so in 2021

370
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,959
found out that the Outlook address book

371
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:14,639
mismatches sometimes the email address

372
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,800
if there is an accent

373
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
that is to say if I am jean-bone I have

374
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,699
the email Jean dot Boom at my company

375
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:26,760
dot on microsoft.com if I'm a pirate I

376
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,540
can register on me crossover.com with an

377
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,120
accent on the I

378
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,060
and send an email to the right guy and

379
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,540
the Outlook address book will match with

380
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,940
the right the real person instead of

381
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,680
saying it's not the same the same guy

382
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,160
yes it's Microsoft what what to expect

383
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,720
right

384
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,720
um what about bad guys because yeah this

385
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,120
is researcher stuff what about bad guys

386
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,060
so yeah sometimes I'm in my Udi as well

387
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,560
but not here

388
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,560
so maybe you heard about apwg the

389
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,839
anti-fishing working group yeah it's a

390
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,939
group of people working on statistics

391
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,679
from phishing and how to protect

392
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,740
ourselves and in fact there were not

393
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,660
many not many

394
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,839
um idns homograph attacks from the past

395
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,900
years we can notice in 2015 the

396
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,040
paypal.com look at the the the rounds at

397
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,959
the bottom I don't know how to call it I

398
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,579
don't know the round at the bottom of

399
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,860
the a right so it's not table it's

400
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,799
something else Facebook with uh hats

401
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:36,720
yeah right an Airbnb with a small thing

402
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,580
under the eye

403
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,460
Yeah Yeah official term the small thing

404
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,679
under the eye yeah yeah I'm sorry I'm

405
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,700
not

406
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,580
in French we call it CD but I don't know

407
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,740
how to say it in English so

408
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,660
so right so not really used by Bad

409
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,900
actors but they still summed that I used

410
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,080
uh look at this PayPal no it's not

411
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,299
PayPal it's pay pay

412
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,960
it's an eye capital I it's pay pay

413
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,480
since the

414
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,539
mid-2000s there is a a Russian citizen

415
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,820
called birikov working in Network

416
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,400
Solutions that has registered these

417
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,380
domain names and is sending phishing

418
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,200
very very often 2011 2012 2017 2020 so

419
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,000
this is a screenshot from Reddit

420
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,640
and you can see it looks like a PayPal

421
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,640
email but it's a paper email paypay is

422
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,200
not the same customer service as PayPal

423
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,559
so maybe not a good another good idea

424
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,660
so what I'm gonna talk about right now

425
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,299
is a French website but French important

426
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,520
for French people French citizens is the

427
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,880
Medicare website the official Medicare

428
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,100
website for for French people

429
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,799
it's called assurance maladi and look

430
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:53,700
again it's not maladi it's mayadi

431
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,580
it's not it's not a nail it's an eye and

432
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,919
this one we found during a training

433
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,840
session an I.T training session with the

434
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,539
Assurance malady I.T staff

435
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:06,419
and we triggered the other the third

436
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:09,240
during the training it was funny so when

437
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,660
we saw it there was many PHP

438
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,980
um fishing pages and the attacker forgot

439
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,419
to remove the auto index from Apache so

440
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:22,860
we could we could browse the

441
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,299
architecture of the website it was fun

442
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,460
but since then it's close to home it's

443
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,940
not so funny

444
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,700
um are you lazy IG people are lazy right

445
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,179
so know that there are already tools to

446
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:37,260
do that

447
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,020
to play with ideas you have got a tool

448
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,559
called evil URL it's um a python script

449
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,419
if I remember well that you can download

450
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,280
you type a domain name that you want to

451
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,539
omograph

452
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,039
and we show you the list all all

453
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,360
available uh omograph domain names right

454
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,480
uh evil Jinx I think many many people

455
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,900
heard about it it's a reverse proxy that

456
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,720
will intercept all post data and get a

457
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,960
usernames passwords totp codes etc etc

458
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,160
so all all in hand right but if you're

459
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,840
like me and you want to do it yourself

460
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,760
you can as well and I'll talk about it

461
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,660
later

462
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,299
so

463
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,400
let's talk about my experiences with ID

464
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,380
and demograph I really think that this

465
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,360
kind of attacks that also happened in

466
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,220
the cryptocurrency world

467
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,059
are going to Boom in the next few years

468
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,940
so what I wanted is domain name for my

469
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,799
French training sessions I.T security

470
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,320
training sessions that talks to every

471
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,179
French people in the in the training

472
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:40,280
session

473
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,059
and

474
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:44,039
um yeah people will recognize and would

475
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,820
see the danger of this so what did I do

476
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,059
in France we have a website the web

477
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:54,480
domains sorry the domain name goof dot

478
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,960
FR it's the equivalent of the dot gov of

479
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,299
the United States right so it's Google

480
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,419
because it's

481
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:06,419
a you yeah yeah so in December Nights

482
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,600
2019 I was on the phone with a friend

483
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,940
and we said maybe we should try

484
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,640
something with this so we looked at

485
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,160
um the naming policy of the ethnic of

486
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,039
the dot FR and there was nothing about

487
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,980
idn's typos squatting or something there

488
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,660
was just something about

489
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,600
um something interesting about

490
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,039
restricted terms there is some terms

491
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,200
that you can put the dot FR with right

492
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,720
like

493
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,419
um Republic francaise or French Republic

494
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,460
or like

495
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,360
um

496
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,340
um some people from

497
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,799
second world war things like this I

498
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,900
don't want to say the H word we don't

499
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,740
know each other as well so we'll see but

500
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,780
terms you can't use extremism racism

501
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,320
Administration you count bets you can if

502
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,720
you have good will and you have a

503
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,940
legitimate interest to do so so let's

504
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,799
say I mean what at what heightseck

505
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:04,140
engineer and my legitimate interest is

506
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,840
trainings and Demos in cyber security so

507
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,580
you can look at the top of the slide now

508
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:14,220
and you'll see the goof.fr and fr which

509
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,400
are the two that I bought right

510
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,940
and what's funny is that I kept them

511
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,700
for one year and a half before getting

512
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,059
cut so that was funny so what I've done

513
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,400
to not end up in jail yeah because jail

514
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,159
you are not not cozy right I put a

515
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,200
static HTML page explaining the attack

516
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,500
and how to protect how to detect and why

517
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,919
not do https with let's encrypt as well

518
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,880
certificate transparency is anybody

519
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,039
watching this but don't care not in

520
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,720
French government at least at the time

521
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,100
so I got

522
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:54,320
is the French word for IRS taxes right

523
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,960
defense I think you understand this

524
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,980
defense.gov.fr alteria is

525
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,980
homelandsecurity.gov.fr

526
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,480
etc etc

527
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,120
and so I got caught the the 31 the 31st

528
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,900
of March 2021 about one year and a half

529
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,640
I was contacted by the the French

530
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,400
national Authority called the NC the

531
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,559
agency the security standard formation

532
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,320
via Twitter DMS because I put in my

533
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,240
Twitter at the bottom of the static web

534
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,659
page and asked me to destroy my my two

535
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:30,179
domain names so yes I complied because I

536
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:32,100
don't want to be here

537
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,320
um to have problems finding jobs

538
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,679
afterwards and they worked on changing

539
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,200
the law for this not to be possible

540
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,039
again right so good thing is I'm on

541
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,679
archive.org so I'm pretty pretty proud

542
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,360
just like when you tag a wall or

543
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,799
something yeah it's funny

544
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,559
uh yeah no they were talking about it

545
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,200
before and during the talk they looked

546
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,620
at goof.fr and I found out my yeah my

547
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,659
stupid my stupid idea

548
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:08,400
so let's say I don't have goof.fr no at

549
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,039
all now so I wanted to do a demo but I

550
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,860
don't want to end up in jail so let's

551
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,980
say I will create a dumb website

552
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,380
and I will attack myself right because

553
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,780
why not so

554
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,419
um maybe in the next slide we'd be hard

555
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,720
for people um that had a hard time

556
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,460
uh last evening right so the website is

557
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,480
called best rakia.com right so yes yes

558
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,280
this is my domain name right it was

559
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,679
available uh not from match so it was

560
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,780
funny so I loved oracia but not all

561
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,000
right yeah but middlewina

562
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,919
right so I created the no world

563
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:51,120
famousbestrakia.com a standard ASCII

564
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,120
domain right for the demonstration it's

565
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,980
a really eShop but everything is out of

566
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,320
stock right don't try to buy anything on

567
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,840
it everything is out of stock and I also

568
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,020
bought two idn homograph attacks and we

569
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,900
are going to see together how does it

570
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,960
look in browsers uh and and emails

571
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,820
because something we think we forget

572
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,539
some sometimes about is the emails so

573
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:18,120
I'll try to keep this alive after the

574
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,059
the talk for you maybe to try to demo

575
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,840
this to to people around you so

576
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,720
what's uh let's let's go to

577
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,600
bestrakia.com right we want to drink

578
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,600
we want to order bestarakia.com looks

579
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,580
looks like a real website

580
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,460
yes

581
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,520
out of stock too bad so this is in fact

582
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,279
just a WordPress with woocommerce uh

583
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:47,520
standard installation and I've I stole

584
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,740
some regular pictures on other websites

585
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,640
but

586
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,500
let's not talk about it

587
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,120
all right so this is a rare website and

588
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,740
I've created a menu menu for my demo

589
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,120
menu.bestrakia.com so you'll have the

590
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,820
real website and the fake ones

591
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,400
so first fake

592
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,400
can you see where the problem is if

593
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,620
you're smart you will look at the

594
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,860
punicord part because any letter missing

595
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,020
in the punicode is the letter I played

596
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,580
with

597
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,460
is the I yes and there is an accent on

598
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,919
the eye and because there is a point on

599
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,740
the J and a point on the I it's kinda

600
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,400
kinda kinda not visible the second one

601
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,799
is the worst one and it's not working so

602
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,140
that's good news right

603
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,279
um the second one can you see the

604
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,400
problem so programming is with the B yes

605
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,299
there is a small dent on the top left

606
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,700
corner of the B

607
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,919
yes you can't see it a lot you have to

608
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,659
be very close to the screen to see it

609
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,760
I'm sorry I don't know how to zoom on

610
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,779
this so let's see how it looks so what

611
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,640
did I done

612
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,220
what's happening when I click on this

613
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,380
it's the same website where's the

614
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,760
problem

615
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,100
the problem is let me go back to the

616
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,740
slides now the problem is

617
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,179
when you're using a legitimate

618
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:10,559
connection you're connected to https

619
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,980
with TLS 1.2 so it's great directly to

620
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,260
best rakia.com the right website but if

621
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,960
you're using the idn one of the two

622
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,140
ideons you will be connected to a Apache

623
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,760
reverse proxy

624
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,679
okay that I configured myself it's not

625
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,600
the evidence I could have done this with

626
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,320
a virginix but I want to play sometimes

627
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,779
and there is a small surprise as well on

628
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:34,740
this

629
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,900
um on this on this machine I'm gonna

630
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,980
show you later

631
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,779
and in fact this reverse proxy is

632
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:41,940
connecting to the real website

633
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,360
so because it's TLS endpoints of two

634
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,820
ends it does everything in clear text at

635
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,880
the middle so if you go to the bad one

636
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,820
let's say you go to Firefox this is the

637
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,380
bad one right let's say I want to login

638
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,080
into my account because right I want to

639
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,580
buy some things

640
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,880
so let's whoa It's room blinking

641
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,960
blinking

642
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,779
yeah this is the the demo the demon will

643
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:10,020
not be fun right can I scroll down

644
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,840
okay and this is technical

645
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,520
okay

646
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,880
oh yeah it's crawling but

647
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,400
see you later

648
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,260
all right

649
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,419
um what you can do anyway you can do it

650
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:27,960
yourself go to menu.bestrakia.com

651
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,659
try to log in from the fake website with

652
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,640
bad credentials bad username bad

653
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,679
password and then go back to the menu

654
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,559
and go to the Pirates flag and you'll

655
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,260
see normally you'll see logs logins and

656
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,100
passwords printed in the PHP PHP page

657
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,799
yeah you can yeah you got

658
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,000
you go you go to my accounts you

659

passwords please

661
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,720
and and then you go back to the menu and

662
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,700
you see the pirate flag and you'll see

663
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,980
maybe a surprise right

664
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,760
so demo is yeah happens demo demo things

665
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,960
all right so how does it look in

666
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,940
browsers if looks fine

667
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,120
so this is zoomed out

668
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,260
a lot right so yes if you zoom a lot you

669
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,419
can see it but

670
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:24,059
from afar with a big regular big

671
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,740
resolution screen

672
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,720
yeah maybe not so much and if your

673
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,580
screen is dirty

674
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,539
you will not see it

675
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,620
yeah

676
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,260
yeah now now you know what to look for

677
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,559
so it's you see it but yeah

678
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,779
also what we've done with a friend is

679
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,620
looking at how does it look in emails

680
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,940
these ideas things

681
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,000
and we saw something about something

682
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,480
done by a guy named slash crypto in 2019

683
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,059
about how does it look in males but we

684
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:00,559
wanted to have a bigger bigger table

685
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,960
with three categories three categories

686
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,240
so what are the three categories you

687
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,039
have the preview of the email that is

688
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,960
the email feed that you got in your

689
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,600
email app the reading email that is when

690
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,980
you double click on the email and you

691
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,919
see the details and the replying

692
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:19,260
so for each

693
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,559
May client that we add on end we try to

694
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,760
see if you can see it's an ID and or not

695
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,200
depending on the client so we've done

696
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,679
run tube Sogo tutanota Thunderbird

00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,640
Apple made Mac OS bam and you got the

703
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,720
results

704
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,360
so from web base

705
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,860
it's a problem

706
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,779
so when you have the check mark it means

707
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:57,480
you're protected you can see it's an idn

708
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,679
right

709
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,340
Sogo I think it's because they don't

710
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,620
understand idns it's not coded inside

711
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,840
the the project I have to look but I

712
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,559
don't think it's coded

713
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,020
so let me try I don't know if it will be

714
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,539
readable but let me try to show you my

715
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,539
Gmail Gmail is a bit small Gmail because

716
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:21,120
of the fonts of the website

717
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,240
you can't even see the accent on the eye

718
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,860
it's a DOT

719
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,500
yeah it's a feature right yeah so if

720
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,299
there is anybody from Google here I

721
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:33,360
don't know but fix your please

722
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,820
um so this is webmails right so webmails

723
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,880
there's one good all right

724
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,059
what about desktop emails good news

725
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:44,700
Thunderbird users you're protected

726
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,640
you'll see the Beautiful

727
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,399
Unicode domain name and right beside it

728
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,919
the punicode so you'll see there is

729
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,919
something not matching right Apple email

730
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,620
on Mac OS is not good for previews

731
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,600
Windows 10 email you know the Windows 10

732
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,240
email app that you can install from the

733
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,820
Microsoft store or whatever is not good

734
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,100
for preview as well and Outlook is the

735
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,520
worst right the worst and what's good is

736
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,919
this the this is the most used in

737
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,260
companies so that's great

738
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,960
about email clients

739
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,039
on mobile uh Apple email on iOS is kinda

740
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,559
good because you you don't see the

741
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,960
beautifully encoded Unicode domain names

742
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,120
but you see the punicodes only this so

743
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,820
it's good on Android canine mail is good

744
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,380
but

745
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,480
there is a problem on Canine mail when

746
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,679
you reply to an email it shows plus one

747
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:42,600
and you have to click on the plus one to

748
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,460
see to who you're going to send the

749
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,140
email yeah it's dumb as I don't

750
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,059
know why they've done this and Gmail

751
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,980
Android is bad as well because of the

752
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,480
fonts Gmail

753
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,840
bad very bad and very bad either desktop

754
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,539
and mobiles please don't use Gmail

755
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:59,580
please please don't use Gmail so how can

756
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,039
we protect ourselves

757
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,020
from from this thing you have too many

758
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,940
memes maybe in my slides but we can talk

759
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,380
about this later

760
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,419
um Firefox Chrome Safari Internet

761
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:10,679
Explorer

762
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,899
rest in peace all have the same kind of

763
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:15,419
protections they have um domain names

764
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:18,120
that are protected and some character

765
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,460
sets that are protected that will be

766
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,899
always printed as punicode in France the

767
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:27,919
ampu.gov.fr which is the IRS tax thing

768
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,140
it's R coded in Google Chrome that this

769
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,140
one should never be puny coded and if

770
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,940
there is characters that look like it

771
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,740
will Auto Spin the Preen code and never

772
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,700
the

773
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,000
beautifully unicoded encoded one

774
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,299
so many of my clients as you so don't

775
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,399
care about Unicode as well or those

776
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,740
stupid things you know Microsoft

777
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,899
um the problem is on the client side is

778
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:53,700
that you can use plugins on your browser

779
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,500
for example that will try to protect you

780
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,220
but the problem is people

781
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,559
we are okay with security and using

782
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,419
plugins and if I ask my mother to

783
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:05,580
install plugin of Firefox she will ask

784
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,740
what's Firefox for the first thing

785
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,320
because for for her the internet is

786
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,899
Google so it's yeah it's hard I love my

787
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,480
mother and she does many great things

788
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,179
but the it is not it's not it's not his

789
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,440
his cup of tea Mom I love you

790
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,359
so you have some tools that helps you

791
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:27,359
Chrome uh uh avasta as on a chrome

792
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,520
plugin that protects you one of my

793
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,679
friends so sorry for the French French

794
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,320
text yeah right but it's a caution fake

795
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,879
website

796
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:39,780
um um Pirates uh Pirates try sometimes

797
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,239
to imitate a website by modifying the

798
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,520
URL uh

799
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,260
um

800
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,839
for um for you not to notice yeah that

801
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,719
would be the translation so it looks

802
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,480
like a real Chrome error yeah from the

803
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,918
browser so it's really good it's a clear

804
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,200
message you can continue anyway if you

805
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,180
want you you know that people always

806
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,099
click on continue a new way yeah right

807
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,859
that's why that's why we created hsts as

808
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,339
well

809
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,380
yeah yeah yeah

810
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,660
um on Firefox you can use punicode

811
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,460
domain detector so this is kind of good

812
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,160
plugin because it adds a really red big

813
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,380
square at the end of the address bar

814
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,540
saying that be careful and you have a

815
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,560
pop-up

816
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,780
that appears saying to you be careful

817
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,780
this is an idea so maybe it's normal

818
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,660
maybe you're visiting a website that is

819
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,579
Japanese and there's Japanese characters

820
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:36,060
in the in the in the domain name but if

821
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,720
you see this and this is not expected

822
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,060
maybe you should be you should be uh you

823
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,119
should be cautious the same plugin on

824
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,960
another browser is stupid same plugin

825
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,040
Chrome

826
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,660
and this time you don't have the pop-up

827
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,280
you have to click

828
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,619
so different behaviors depending on the

829
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,740
browser this is not good so we get you

830
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,720
we got in touch with the developer of

831
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,020
the of the plugin it sent us the a

832
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,780
published them on GitHub the code the

833
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,579
source code for his plugin so maybe we

834
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,740
could maybe we can fix this but with

835
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,800
chrome changing their API things and

836
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,940
whatevers yeah thank you Google right so

837
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,740
same plugin different behaviors so you

838
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,720
have to be careful good recommendation

839
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,880
on Chrome but be careful because this

840
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,859
one is the

841
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:28,440
the best one right so this one is called

842
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,300
puny fix you can't miss the banner

843
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,240
because look at the size of this Banner

844
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,900
danger Petty group perigo right and the

845
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,180
tab close automatically after 10 seconds

846
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,400
you can't browse anything on it you

847
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,780
don't have time to put your passwords

848
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,760
inside this it's without core but it

849
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,320
works so

850
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,200
whatever on the registry side what can

851
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,540
we do as a

852
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,000
TLD

853
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,160
registry cctld should only accept

854
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,220
correct alphabets for the country uh

855
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,400
just like this one for Syria alphabets

856
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,180
from Russia and no more just cereal no

857
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,760
more so it's good Dodge ifar is good as

858
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,619
well so there is only characters from

859
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:12,839
the French and local languages so it's

860
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:16,859
okay but anyway we can always find

861
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:20,220
dietrichs and things to mix so it's not

862
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,759
only answer

863
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,099
and the last part is yourself you have a

864
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:28,200
domain name you have

865
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,079
to do monitoring yeah right nobody likes

866
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,720
monitoring but we have to so you have

867
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,420
GitHub scripts so we talked about evil

868
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,920
URL before you can add DNS twist and URL

869
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,400
crazy available GitHub you can also pay

870
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,140
if you're a big company pay your private

871
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,960
company to do this for you so I'm not

872
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,540
linked or affiliated with anyone so I've

873
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,040
listed free

874
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,200
name Shield ovh or who is XML API to

875
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,720
watch and warn you send you a warning

876
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,640
when there is domain name that has been

877
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,800
registered that it closed to yours

878
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,380
but everybody monitors right

879
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,839
and the last thing that we can work on

880
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,260
is laws and international cooperation

881
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,940
um they are in some countries like

882
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,820
France some national laws that prevents

883
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,540
malicious ideas because you may

884
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,359
in France at least we have exceptions

885
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:28,680
like parody right to inform Etc were

886
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,079
acceptable so we have we have the right

887
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:34,140
to use them stupid the two mocha

888
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,020
company or something

889
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,000
so yes so we should prevent malicious

890
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,240
but allow yeah it's hard right

891
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,060
malicious it's it's a hard term to

892
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,859
Define depending on on which person you

893
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:48,839
ask the question so we are all in this

894
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:49,920
together

895
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,160
uh Europe may be about to lift gdpr

896
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,859
um privacy uh redacted for privacy text

897
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,619
on dominance we hope so please do

898
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,780
something because it's pain in the ass

899
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,940
right now but

900
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,160
um it would be a great start for us to

901
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,380
try to see who reserves what domain

902
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,839
names but we have together to together

903
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,300
we have to to

904
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,339
to talk about this problem because I

905
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:17,280
have a bet with you uh for for a few few

906
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,180
years

907
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,460
so well yeah yeah it's nearly the end

908
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,460
now so please spread the world the world

909
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,980
about this around you the slides are

910
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,500

uh spread the words around you to want

915
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:39,900
people about these technique protections

916
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,000
via browser plugins from now

917
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,900
I bet not every one of you but I bet a

918
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,420
rakia bottle shared with everyone here

919
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,579
that's in no more than five years this

920
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:51,960
kind of attacks will be more prevalent

921
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,079
than they are today right because we ask

922
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,540
people to look correctly at the domain

923
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,380
name

924
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,260
but they will maybe not understand that

925
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,720
o and O with an accent is not the same

926
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,640
domain not at all

927
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,300
so yes we have still a lot a lot of

928
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,060
um of word spreading to do about this so

929
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,160
special thanks to balconoga team you're

930

931
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:19,560
thanks to Fred crypto and the just guy

932
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,619
there for the bad and good advices uh

933
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:23,820
when I was contacted by French

934
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,740
authorities for example thank you very

935
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,460
much

936
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,099
and thank you for listening to me if you

937
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:30,800
have any questions

938
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,440
that's that's now and we'll see you at

939
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,940
the bar if you have another question

940
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,359
because I have a subscription there

941
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,920
right

942
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,520
thank you

943
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,579
thank you you touched on this very

944
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:53,280
briefly at the end we've had internet uh

945
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,560
audience for a long time and we could

946
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,720
have done the sort of attack before why

947
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,420
now will it happen more than before

948
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,220
because

949
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,760
um it's the way we we uh as I see in

950
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,440
France maybe it's not the same in other

951
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,680
countries right the since the awareness

952
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,079
raising about I.T security and fishing

953
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,420
and things like this from what we saw in

954
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,119
France in 10 years ago we we said to

955
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,920
people you have to look at the padlock

956
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,680
is the padlock here https is it here is

957
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,079
it not here

958
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,300
uh then we talked about now people we

959
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,400
are saying to them we you have to get a

960
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,200
look at the domain name you have to look

961
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,599
the domain name and read correctly the

962
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,240
domain name to see if it's real

963
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,380
accounts.google.com or if it's something

964
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,220
else

965
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,440
so I think it's coming now

966
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,060
um it will be coming in the next years

967
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,980
because for now people are not

968
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,140
sufficiently looking at this website

969
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,720
they click they clicked on a phishing

970
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,000
email for example they don't look if

971
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,700
it's look the right page if it's the the

972
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,339
page is right it's what they expect they

973
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:57,960
will not try to look at the address bar

974
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,839
right now so the more and more we raise

975
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,940
awareness about this the more people we

976
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,740
watch the address bar

977
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,839
but it doesn't mean that they will

978
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:10,440
understand that an accent or a DOT or uh

979
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,300
something will be a different domain

980
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,220
than the one they're currently using so

981
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,500
I think that's why we are starting to

982
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,320
see more and more

983
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,760
idea and attacks homographic attacks

984
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,940
right now and we'll be seeing soon in

985
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,520
the future I I think it's it's a bit as

986
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,720
I told you it's a bit

987
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,819
um but we'll see see you in five years

988
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,560
is there any other question

989
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:46,619
laughs

990
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,640
yeah so it wasn't mutant all right um do

991
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,560
you know if uh with dmarc you can avoid

992
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,040
homographic attacks no

993
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,180
the only

994
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:57,780
um

995
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,099
only applies

996
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:01,380
the domain name that you have and not

997
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,599
the ones that you have not

998
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,040
so no and in fact it would be kinda a

999
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,180
problem

1000
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,980
because

1001
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,020
um maybe you have

1002
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,180
um maybe somebody that is doing a normal

1003
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,300
graph attack he's not really attacking

1004
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,359
you but in fact is reserving a domain

1005
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,819
name that he has right to own

1006
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:27,119
and it will be I think if we could have

1007
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,119
this kind of things with dmarc or SPF or

1008
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:31,500
or

1009
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,599
um what is the third one

1010
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,900
um yeah if we had this kind of

1011
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,339
protections the problem would be the

1012
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:41,700
same as DNS blacklists from email

1013
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,560
servers you see what I mean that you

1014
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,780
have to unblacklist yourself for many

1015
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,599
many things because people are like Kobo

1016
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:51,960
is shooting every IP ranges that just

1017
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,660
look strange so I think it would be a

1018
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,240
problem doing this this way I think the

1019
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,859
best way to protect yourself is to

1020
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:01,560
monitor that's that's the thing and it's

1021
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,660
easy to do you just have to launch the

1022
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,700
script launch the script today compare

1023
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,220
the results if there is any mismatch in

1024
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,020
the results of the script you send an

1025
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,000
email there is a problem

1026
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,700
so it's easy to do so that's that will

1027
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,480
be my answer

1028
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,460
how do you protect against such attacks

1029
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,800
when the legitimate domain is already in

1030
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,339
puny code

1031
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,940
real for example already implements the

1032
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,520
my original domain the one that I want

1033
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,359
to

1034
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:45,839
to um homograph attack is

1035
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,420
um already a punicode so you can have in

1036
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,740
the same language

1037
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,040
um letters that can looks the same so if

1038
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,240
you watch if your monitoring with for

1039
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,000
example evil URL it will protect you as

1040
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,680
well because it understands the puny

1041
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,720
code and try to find similar domain

1042
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,500
names

1043
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,540
using the same thing though so you can

1044
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,060
protect yourself with monitoring again I

1045
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,160
mean if you show the punicode

1046
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,400
they'll both look like gibberish

1047
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,140
like if you showed the legitimate puny

1048
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,260
code and the other punicode so

1049
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,240
it seemed like less obvious to me than

1050
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,520
in fact you just have to understand they

1051
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,099
are the same it's the same thing uncut

1052
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,540
it differently but it's the same thing

1053
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,880
so every URL understand if I remember

1054
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,480
well both the beautifully unicoded

1055
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,640
domain name and the puny coated because

1056
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,440
they have the same impact your browser

1057
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,140
is only doing a trick on you encoding

1058
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,720
correctly in Unicode the domain name so

1059
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,700
it's it's the same thing it's the same

1060
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,879
thing

1061
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,560
is that okay no questions

1062
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,339
no just a follow-up to that so for

1063
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:59,339
example the word iropod right so so you

1064
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,440
had it in your example so that has an

1065
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,119
upward sloping what is it axon like you

1066
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,819
or whatever and then what if you put a

1067
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:07,859
you know downward sloping Accent on that

1068
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:11,339
it's uh it seems to me to be more

1069
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:14,940
important to avoid those kinds of those

1070
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,680
kinds of you know

1071
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,300
um names

1072
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,240
a yes but it's it's a problem for some

1073
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,640
countries like let's say for example

1074
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,560
Japanese people

1075
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,560
they don't use Latin alphabets and it

1076
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,359
doesn't make any sense for them so yes

1077
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:33,119
they have the Roman G which is the the

1078
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,500
the the the way of talking no no I get

1079
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,119
that I'm saying comparing gibberish to

1080
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,560
gibberish you know that you have to be

1081
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,520
careful but comparing that our port and

1082
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,440
then at the end you have just three

1083
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,960
letters and then they could be just you

1084
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,540
know a tiny difference there uh and it

1085
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,099
would completely change the meaning of

1086
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:54,720
the word because it would just change

1087
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,819
the accent and then a person looks at

1088
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:59,040
that accent and thinks okay it's just a

1089
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,560
line I was expecting a line my point is

1090
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,500
if I were to you know put a website up

1091
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,720
like that I would think twice about

1092
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,359
putting anything that has to be accented

1093
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,940
yes but the problem is with dietrix is

1094
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,579
that you can accent so many characters

1095
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:16,079
that's

1096
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,359
that's it might be hard for you to just

1097
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:21,599
find the domain names without any uh

1098
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,940
combining dietary characters possible

1099
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,819
let's just avoid accentation completely

1100
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:30,240
yeah avoid accentation but again in in

1101
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,400
French for example we have words and and

1102
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,920
some words it's written in accents you

1103
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,760
don't have any choice uh with energy for

1104
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,420
example the energy French word as an

1105
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,520
accent and it's written like this so if

1106
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,000
you want energy or not energy you have

1107
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,500
to put an accent because it's not it's

1108
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,300
not the same thing and we have different

1109
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,160
some words with accents are not the same

1110
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,460
but I mean I'm look I'm Serbian right so

1111
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,440
each right so but I'm still not going to

1112
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,800
register

1113
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:06,060
yes but the problem is even though you

1114
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:09,300
will not use accents at all it doesn't

1115
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,579
prevent people to try to reserve

1116
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:13,440
dominance I'm saying just for Best

1117
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,300
Practices yeah that might be the case

1118
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,520
yeah that's that's all I wanted to say

1119
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,460
okay okay okay then you have to watch as

1120
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,819
well to be sure that nobody is homograph

1121
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:25,859
homographic attacking you

1122
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:30,020
I got it thank you thank you very much

1123
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,839
foreign

1124
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,480
but I asked and you didn't mention

1125
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,119
newbie keys right or u2f in general no

1126
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,760
yeah we can talk a bit about it yes um

1127
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,859
in fact this kind of attacks like with

1128
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:52,680
the evil genics or the Apache reverse

1129
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,420
proxy thing we will be able to catch any

1130
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,920
totp codes that say Google authentic

1131
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,680
character and things like this any email

1132
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,220
or as a text message uh code Etc the

1133
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,140
only way to protect yourself from this

1134
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:11,579
kind of attacks is using Fido keys

1135
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:13,980
yes you know fighter Keys the small keys

1136
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,900
that you plug on your computer does

1137
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,640
cryptographic things with the browser

1138
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,339
domain real domain name

1139
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:23,700
and generate keys and sign things to

1140
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,200
authenticate yourself to a website

1141
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,900
because it's the browser that decides

1142
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,319
which domain the key is using the

1143
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:33,359
browser cannot lie it can lie to you

1144
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,520
visually but can it can it cannot lie to

1145
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,440
the key so the domain name will not be

1146
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,680
best at ikea.com it will be xn dash dash

1147
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,040
best

1148
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,140
job.com Dash uh yeah you see what I mean

1149
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,180
so it will not be in the same domain and

1150
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,160
you will not be able to catch it yeah so

1151
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,500
the only the one way also to protect

1152
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,660
yourself is using fighter Keys Fido

1153
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,160
fido2 Keys yeah you're right

1154
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:01,319
so there is a kind of attack without

1155
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:04,619
using idns and I experienced it myself

1156
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:07,500
not that I got caught in it but I saw it

1157
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,339
for a steam community.com they used RN

1158
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:14,520
instead of M so it looks really similar

1159
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,859
yeah and if you don't look close enough

1160
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,980
you won't notice it yeah yeah yeah the

1161
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,960
goal is the same the goal of homographic

1162
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,819
attack I'm talking about idns so yeah

1163
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:27,180
but it's the same you it's looking just

1164
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,880
a bit the same that it can some people

1165
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,180
can be can be fooled by this yes yes uh

1166
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,640
steam is Steam Community attack is just

1167
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,940
like the Pepe or as soon as my ID that

1168
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,220
we saw in the slides before so yes yes

1169
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,700
it's a big problem right now

1170
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:48,000
so our registers taking any action like

1171
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,420
is it specifically harder to register

1172
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:55,079
the pony code domain name even for an

1173
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:58,079
existing one do they compare did I

1174
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,660
already register for the actual airport

1175
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,300
and now I'm registering for airport with

1176
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,020
an E accented they don't care

1177
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:10,440
first come first served and in fact it

1178
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,720
was funny for the groove.fr I can tell

1179
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,700
you a story for the good.fr when I

1180
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,460
reserved it with a French registrar

1181
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,200
called Gandhi

1182
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,280
um uh I I received an email just by the

1183
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,380
time I bought it saying that domain

1184
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,940
names are frozen

1185
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,160
my God they got me

1186
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,859
no no they were just I asking for my my

1187
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:33,420
ID card because you have to be a

1188
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:37,020
European citizen to to reserve domain

1189
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,579

1190
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:41,640
