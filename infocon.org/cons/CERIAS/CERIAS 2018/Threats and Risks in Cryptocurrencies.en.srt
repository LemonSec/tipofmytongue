1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,180
it's my pleasure to introduce Courtney

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,100
Falk to as our speaker today and he

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,620
probably needs no introduction

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,210
he's a serious graduate he's very

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:21,560
familiar with the program very familiar

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:23,240
with the campus he's been working in the

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,430
last ten years in government academic

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,159
and public sector earned his PhD here at

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,900
Purdue as I said and is currently

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,210
working as a senior research scientist

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,920
for up to his global Threat Intelligence

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:38,690
Center so I'll just turn it over to

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:42,559
Courtney thank you very much yeah so I

14
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:45,260
fish my PhD almost two years ago now so

15
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,089
feels a little weird still being on this

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,839
side of the podium as opposed every

17
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:52,909
Wednesday being in the seats I work for

18
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:54,949
Optive in a small unit called the global

19
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:57,769
threat intelligence center octaves in

20
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:59,930
MSS a managed security solutions

21
00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:01,670
provider so we're a little different

22
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,519
inside Optive in that instead of

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:07,490
focusing on internal customer networks

24
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,710
we actually look externally we look at

25
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,720
trends that are going on outside the

26
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,880
company in the greater world to help

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:18,610
inform our customers as to what kind of

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:21,079
threats they might see in the future I

29
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:23,869
actually work in Indianapolis I'm gonna

30
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:26,419
be back for the symposium so if anybody

31
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:28,130
has any questions or further discussions

32
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,619
you'd like to have I'd be happy to make

33
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:34,310
time for you otherwise you can email me

34
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:35,960
at the decoded address might be happy to

35
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,869
give you a copy of the slides with notes

36
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,809
and URLs to the sources that I'm gonna

37
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:43,060
cite and this will also eventually end

38
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,030
up on ResearchGate

39
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:49,310
I worked for a while in the intelligence

40
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,049
community for the US government that

41
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,390
then worked in private industry before

42
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:56,780
doing the PhD so like Jerry mentioned

43
00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:01,609
I've touched on all three facets of the

44
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,990
security industry and marketing would

45
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:04,820
like me to tell you that none of this

46
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,419
information is going to reveal anything

47
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,318
about our customers networks or breaches

48
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,750
everything I'm going to talk about is

49
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:13,700
open source and to prove that I'm not

50
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,680
shilling for any cryptocurrency I don't

51
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,109
actually own anything nor do I actually

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,260
have I owned anything in the past so I'm

53
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,450
not gonna make any money off this real

54
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,459
quick I'm going to touch on what threat

55
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,769
intelligence is and what it how we

56
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,580
practice it in the

57
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,960
took a brief primer on cryptocurrencies

58
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,660
but the me of why I'm gonna talk about

59
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,820
is how we see crypto currency used in

60
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,609
cyberattacks which is mostly going to

61
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,950
consist of cybercrime and time

62
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,890
permitting I'll touch on some of the

63
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:48,070
social aspects of it the economics the

64
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,929
policy and the governance aspects and

65
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:54,730
I'd like to leave five to ten minutes at

66
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:56,830
the end for Q&A so if you read back

67
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,420
through this later I'll leave this in

68
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,070
the slide deck if you want to

69
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,530
dereference any of the terms I'm gonna

70
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,750
use but I'll try to explain them as I go

71
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,720
along

72
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,730
so threat intelligence we in the G Tech

73
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,780
are mostly coming from a military

74
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:18,399
intelligence background so intelligence

75
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:21,340
to us is taking raw data applying human

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,560
analysis to it and producing a product

77
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,840
out from that it could be a brief

78
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,690
summary or snippet like a warning or it

79
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,160
could be a more in-depth product what

80
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,040
we're grinding on right now is our

81
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,290
annual report which is modeled after the

82
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,450
National Intelligence Estimate so it's

83
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,030
about 40 60 pages where we try to

84
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,160
predict where we think trends will be

85
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,570
going in the next year and unfortunately

86
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:48,250
we're we've got a pretty good track

87
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:50,709
record so in in our work we we track

88
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:54,160
three different aspects we track actors

89
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:56,620
who are the people behind the attacks we

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,620
track campaigns which are sustained

91
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:02,080
attacks across targets and we look at

92
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,560
the TTP and the tools and how people are

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,690
carrying out the attacks so the hardest

94
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,090
part is the ambiguity and the

95
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,770
uncertainty sometimes you have poor

96
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,490
quality data sometimes you have no data

97
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:17,680
sometimes you get into a kind of ironic

98
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,510
situation like the attacks with wanna

99
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,120
cry or not Pecha where you have a

100
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,969
ridiculous amount of data but it's still

101
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,220
kind of difficult to discern patterns

102
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:31,150
from it so you're looking to corroborate

103
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,770
sources and come to a conclusion based

104
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,810
on what limited information are

105
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,710
circumstantial evidence you might have

106
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,210
at hand so if you've ever had to deal

107
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,440
with anyone from

108
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,840
the military intelligence background

109
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,490
you'll see this diagram it's either four

110
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,039
or five steps but it's always the same

111
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,530
cycle every single time so what you

112
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:52,990
start with is the requirements phase so

113
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:56,138
it's like writing a research question

114
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,940
you can't actually start doing the

115
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:00,490
research until you have the question in

116
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,070
mind and then once you have the question

117
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,500
you gather the data you perform your

118
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:08,860
analysis on it and once you have the

119
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,830
analysis your product be it like a long

120
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,900
term long form report or perhaps small

121
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,229
pieces of machine readable intelligence

122
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:19,570
can get pushed out like we have servers

123
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:21,880
that our customers have access to where

124
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,340
we push out like signatures for malware

125
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:30,969
or network traffic that they can then

126
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:34,060
use to block at their perimeters as an

127
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:37,630
example the scope of the problem this is

128
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:40,120
my my Chrome bookmarks this is just

129
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:43,419
bookmarks dealing with cryptocurrency

130
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,240
related attacks and this was yesterday

131
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:48,639
so I have more data than I could

132
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,320
possibly talk about today so let's keep

133
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,960
moving does anybody here own any

134
00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:02,110
cryptocurrency know his name by done

135
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:05,130
crypto mining before no so the core idea

136
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:08,380
of basically all the cryptocurrencies is

137
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,210
there is a ledger and ledger records all

138
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,630
the transactions that have happened

139
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:16,180
using that currency and the ledger is

140
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:20,440
actually distributed across this network

141
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:23,110
of users the mining process which you'll

142
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,389
hear about a lot is when new entries are

143
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,460
added to the ledger and it's called

144
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:30,490
mining because of the work put into it

145
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:34,500
these cryptographic functions are

146
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:38,080
intentionally chosen to be CPU intensive

147
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,139
and we'll touch on that also but it's

148
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,969
called mining but all it really is is

149
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,099
basically being like a public notary you

150
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,650
get a stack of transactions in you

151
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:51,900
perform math on it and then you add it

152
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:54,070
to the ledger as the new blessed entry

153
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,580
those entries are coming from

154
00:06:54,070 --> 00:07:01,060
as actions goods and services those are

155
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:05,140
being signed off on by wallets and

156
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,150
wallets are just the cryptographic keys

157
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,580
that are used in these transactions and

158
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,620
it's it's a confusing term because their

159
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,109
software wallets their hardware wallets

160
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,060
I have a paper wallet which just means

161
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,210
that my crypto keys are printed on a

162
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:22,330
piece of paper that I've written down so

163
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,909
if you wanted to steal my point zero

164
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,380
zero five of Manero you would have to

165
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,450
physically take this piece of paper from

166
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,300
me which means I can't use that

167
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:34,900
cryptocurrency very quickly but in my

168
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,550
case that's not a huge concern but if

169
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,090
you want to cut to the chase and you

170
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,830
want to turn your euro or your dollar

171
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:44,409
into crypto currencies you have to go to

172
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,390
the exchanges so the exchanges are where

173
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,400
you actually take your your fiat your

174
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,039
government issued currency and exchange

175
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,580
it which is usually in this case limited

176
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,550
to Bitcoin etherium and litecoin

177
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,990
so despite the dozens and hundreds of

178
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:03,820
different coins you'll see you can't

179
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:06,960
actually just buy those straight mining

180
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:09,820
is the backbone of the cryptocurrency

181
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,340
when it began it was enough to have a

182
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,010
CPU in your desktop or maybe your server

183
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:17,739
that you would be able to produce

184
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,120
results it's really a race condition the

185
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,830
problem is given out to the whole

186
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,890
network and the first person who can get

187
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,719
the answer gets the reward which is you

188
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:29,260
get the transaction fee and with some

189
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,890
currencies you get a monetary reward in

190
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,780
that currency so it's incentivized after

191
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:38,409
the CPU miners they developed the

192
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:40,240
graphics processors which I can mine

193
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:44,140
monaro like four to five times faster

194
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,900
with my GPU as opposed to my CPU but

195
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,030
then became the application specific

196
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,630
integrated circuits so these are actual

197
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:55,060
pieces of silicon that are each tin

198
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,490
designed to perform a single function so

199
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,489
like for Bitcoin you'll get an ASIC that

200
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:03,400
can crank through the sha-256 function

201
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,920
and we'll see those real quick and they

202
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,079
they come to dominate but if you're a

203
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,479
little guy you can join a mining

204
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,160
Poole so a lot of low guys can get

205
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,140
together and pull their resources and

206
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,920
you get fractional amounts of what the

207
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:20,590
whole pool is rewarded but at this point

208
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,770
with currencies like Bitcoin you you

209
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:25,750
basically have to go big or go home and

210
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:28,720
these Russian nuclear scientists they

211
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,430
they set their sights pretty high but

212
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,780
we'll talk about OPSEC here in a minute

213
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:35,650
they might have set their sights a

214
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:38,020
little too high this is a buddy of mine

215
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:42,569
he works for Apple but he lives up the

216
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:44,740
road in Valpo he's standing next to his

217
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:48,520
cryptocurrency rig for a while he's

218
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:52,570
doing Bitcoin he's got like four four

219
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:57,010
rackmount units in like 12 or 16 single

220
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:59,290
units he had he said to dedicated 30 amp

221
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:04,270
circuits in his basement just for this

222
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:07,810
setup and he was spending $500 a month

223
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:09,400
in electricity I didn't get a clear

224
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,609
answer on whether or not he was actually

225
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:15,030
breaking even on that or not but this is

226
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:18,970
what he's up against and this is a

227
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:20,980
Bitcoin mine in China and there's a good

228
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,020
link to this vise motherboard

229
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,580
documentary on YouTube and it's really

230
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,060
interesting to see the setup they have

231
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,960
going

232
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:33,189
they actually have on-site IT 24/7 who

233
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:36,010
live there so what's the market looking

234
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:38,200
like right now the market capitalization

235
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:42,430
how much money is actually invested in

236
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,380
these right now 180 billion is written

237
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,599
Bitcoin right now this was yesterday

238
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,660
afternoon and you could start to see

239
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,270
some of the interesting fluctuations and

240
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:57,130
volatility that have only really

241
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:59,560
happened in the last year or two so

242
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,300
that's what cryptocurrency is how is it

243
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,569
actually being used in relation to

244
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,979
cyberattacks we partner with a company

245
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:12,670
called int sites it's out of Tel Aviv

246
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:15,010
they collect data from hacker forums in

247
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,500
the Deep Web and dark net so they do

248
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,330
things like they create fake identities

249
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,080
and they use these identities to get

250
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,560
into the hacker forums and come

251
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:27,050
trusted and then they can start using

252
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,969
their BOTS to start scraping the data so

253
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,640
I did a quick search for some of the

254
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,790
better-known cryptocurrencies and here's

255
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,470
some of the results I came up with

256
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:39,890
Bitcoin far and away the most talked

257
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,510
about and you can start to see once you

258
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,800
remove Bitcoin you can start to see the

259
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,660
breakdown between some of the secondary

260
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,319
coins but they don't they don't even

261
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:51,110
really come close yet how the coins are

262
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,920
used we'll talk about here in a second

263
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:57,260
but it varies the use case from coin to

264
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:03,260
coin so this guy is talking about

265
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:05,900
Bitcoin he's he's selling a Trojan which

266
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,760
will actually steal Bitcoin from your

267
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,670
wallet so they'll either steal the key

268
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,640
or it'll initiate transactions using

269
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,500
your wallet yeah you login or you fire

270
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,030
up the wallet software and your pc and

271
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,650
then they'll be able to transfer money

272
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:26,030
out the other big topic I saw regarding

273
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:29,420
to Bitcoin was a lot of like how-to

274
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:31,280
guides or tutorials like what is Bitcoin

275
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,400
and how can you make money off Bitcoin

276
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,860
and people were trying to sell that like

277
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,360
the UM I forget the guys name the guy

278
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,070
who wore the suit with the question

279
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,570
marks and trying to sell you guides on

280
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:46,730
how to make money from the government

281
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:49,190
Manero is different and you'll be

282
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:52,520
hearing a lot more about Montero this

283
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:56,900
guy is selling actual software to be run

284
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:59,240
on a desktop or PC so you'll put it on a

285
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,699
victim's machine you'll pop them with

286
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,890
like phishing or an exploit kit you'll

287
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,350
put a miner on their box and their PC is

288
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,580
going to literally make money for you

289
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,480
and you won't have to spend the

290
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:14,720
electricity obviously and the other use

291
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,910
case is instead of exploiting individual

292
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,640
boxes and putting it on there let's

293
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:22,400
exploit a web server and we'll put on

294
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,290
that web server a piece of code that

295
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,459
will get people to mind Manero when they

296
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:30,410
come to our website so we've talked

297
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:35,000
about briefly these two different use

298
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:37,610
cases we've talked about Bitcoin

299
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,920
and we've talked about Manero Bitcoin is

300
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,640
still seeing mostly in ransomware

301
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,550
situations so ransomware is that special

302
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:50,390
class of malware it gets on your machine

303
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:53,810
and it'll lock access to files usually

304
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,670
via cryptography so it'll digitally

305
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,709
encrypt all your files and then you'll

306
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,140
have to pay the ransom in order to get

307
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:03,230
the private key to then decrypt all the

308
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:05,840
files Bitcoin is the most popular for

309
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:08,030
that because Bitcoin has the first mover

310
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,880
advantage it has the largest market

311
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:13,579
share and it's the easiest coin for

312
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,620
victims to get a hold of so to increase

313
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,150
the likelihood of someone actually

314
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,780
paying the ransom they don't want to

315
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:24,260
make it too difficult to pay so thank

316
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,910
goodness for that we we actually had a

317
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,120
question come in at one point from a

318
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:32,750
customer that basically said how do I

319
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,420
buy Bitcoin like at this point I know I

320
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:38,900
screwed up but I just need my computers

321
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:42,290
back and they're they're actually ATMs

322
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:47,000
and the exchanges and debit cards that

323
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:48,319
you can use to buy Bitcoin now but

324
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,090
remember just because you pay the ransom

325
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,610
doesn't mean they're actually going to

326
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:56,900
give you the keys or more interestingly

327
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:59,060
there might not be keys so specific to

328
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,380
ransomware attacks it's becoming

329
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,569
apparent that some of these ransomware

330
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:06,170
attacks are actually destructive attacks

331
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:08,600
where the difference between encrypting

332
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:10,939
something and throwing away the key and

333
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,680
just deleting the file I mean it's the

334
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,850
same thing if you throw away the crypto

335
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,979
key you're never going to get access to

336
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,750
that file again but there's an

337
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,450
interesting aspect where if you suggest

338
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,730
there's hope you can then get them to be

339
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:26,240
distracted and spend more time trying to

340
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:28,850
get that back the other use case for

341
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,250
cryptocurrencies is in crypto jacking

342
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,830
and crypto jacking is a situation where

343
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,350
you hijack either a desktop or a web

344
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:38,540
browser to mine a crypto currency for

345
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,280
you and that's where I'm on arrow comes

346
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,790
in and it's more popular than Bitcoin

347
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:45,470
for two main reasons the first reason is

348
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:48,370
that you can still mine money row with

349
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:51,130
the CPU or a GPU you don't need the

350
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,930
special ayzik chips and that was

351
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,180
actually part of the design of Manero

352
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,930
the other aspect that was also designed

353
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,750
into my narrow

354
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:01,029
is the privacy you essentially cannot

355
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:04,060
track transactions through the Monaro

356
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:07,720
ledger without that person special it's

357
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:10,209
called a view key so you the victim can

358
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,460
mine monaro and you can see it go into

359
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:16,390
the Monaro ledger but you have no way to

360
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:19,000
track that back so those are the two

361
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:22,560
things that really make it attractive

362
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,339
I talked briefly about exploit kits

363
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,319
exploit kits are basically just

364
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:29,529
malicious web pages you get redirected

365
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,140
to with like either a phishing link or a

366
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:34,029
hacked web page and there they have a

367
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,400
set of exploits that they'll try against

368
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:37,779
your web browser so they redirect you

369
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,730
they pop your web browser and then

370
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:41,290
they're on your box and the trend we're

371
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,900
seeing is that it used to be they would

372
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,420
serve ransomware so like wanna cry and

373
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,120
whatnot they're actually shifting to

374
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,620
using crypto miners now so they'll

375
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,520
exploit your box and they'll put like

376
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:56,560
XMR on and then you'll be mining one

377
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:01,810
arrow for somebody and not really know

378
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:04,899
it there is the interesting scenario of

379
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:07,659
Bitcoin used as evidence so if you

380
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,850
remember Ross Ulbricht who went by the

381
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,980
Dread Pirate Roberts who ran the

382
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:16,329
original Silk Road I think we're up to

383
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:19,839
Silk Road 3.0 now he got arrested they

384
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:22,389
were able to get ahold of his wallet so

385
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:26,139
they knew what keys he used personally

386
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:28,329
his his defense was yeah I started I

387
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,460
started Silk Road but I wasn't running

388
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:33,250
it when you said I did something illegal

389
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,870
but they got his wallet they were

390
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,600
actually able to use those keys to go

391
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,550
back through the ledger and see all his

392
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,949
transactions and actually established

393
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:44,740
forensic Lee at this point these

394
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:47,080
payments from Silk Road went into your

395
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,840
personal wallet that was on your laptop

396
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,870
when we arrested you at that point he

397
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,490
was convicted the interesting that thing

398
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:57,100
that happened afterwards was Bitcoin

399
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,950
shot up and then at least one of the

400
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:02,119
arresting officers or might been Secret

401
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:05,809
Service ended up stealing some of the

402
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:09,769
coin out of the digital evidence and he

403
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:11,089
went to jail too so with crypto mining

404
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:14,809
we've already talked about how it's

405
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:17,149
popular to use Manero you originally it

406
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:19,158
was we would we would get on an

407
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:22,518
individual box and we would install a

408
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:25,129
crypto miner this started out being like

409
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:27,439
IT people with access to the backend

410
00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:29,389
servers they would find a box and they

411
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,039
did install a Bitcoin miner and be like

412
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:33,438
well you know my company will pay for

413
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,899
the electricity no one's really getting

414
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:40,309
hurt that then changed to using worms so

415
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:42,228
at the same time that wanna cry was

416
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:44,658
going on a separate worm was spreading

417
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:46,369
and dropping a cryptocurrency miner and

418
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:50,989
that wasn't even the first instance of

419
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:54,049
that the easy fix is that organizations

420
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:55,849
should just blacklist all the miners so

421
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:58,879
a lot of the mining software that's used

422
00:18:55,849 --> 00:19:03,259
is open-source so they'll go directly to

423
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:05,448
XMR or night miner and download the the

424
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:07,399
whole package and use it so they're not

425
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:08,239
actually recompiling or redesigning

426
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:10,819
their own miner

427
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:14,809
it should be fairly easy and automatic

428
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:16,668
to blacklist all these binary images and

429
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:18,229
also some of the signature traffic there

430
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:21,319
there's really no reason to be running

431
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:24,469
this in your organization the other

432
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:26,449
instance of mining crypto jacking is

433
00:19:24,469 --> 00:19:29,479
when it gets injected into your web

434
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:30,739
browser that's also open source you can

435
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:32,929
go and you can get there

436
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:37,069
it's coin hive is the most popular

437
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:38,869
software it's on github but if you

438
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:40,699
somehow get to some place and someone's

439
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:43,579
running a miner in your browser the

440
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:44,989
easiest step is close your browser was

441
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:46,459
the advice we're actually giving our

442
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:49,669
customers it's you close your browser

443
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:50,779
and it stops running people have gotten

444
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:53,359
a little smarter they've actually

445
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:55,759
started creating like one by one pixel

446
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:58,519
size new browser instances so you can

447
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,959
close the one you accidentally started

448
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:03,139
mining in and they'll still be able to

449
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:08,559
mine and they also attack third-party

450
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:12,258
sites like ad networks or someone

451
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,719
exploited like an accessibility like a

452
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:16,020
handicap accessibility add-on and

453
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:20,130
inserted the Krypton

454
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:23,550
liner into that coin hive started with

455
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:26,880
this good idea the idea was we can

456
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:29,100
monetize websites in a different way the

457
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,840
old model was advertising and the new my

458
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:37,020
model is crypto mining a mega Co which

459
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:40,080
is the New Zealand upload site they did

460
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,070
this the problem with their approach was

461
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,080
they didn't telling when they're going

462
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:45,450
to do it they were like we're doing an

463
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,490
experiment and people noticed and got a

464
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,050
little upset and then after the fact

465
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:52,440
they explained what was going on so that

466
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:56,159
was poor marketing on their side salon

467
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:59,070
the blog and new site they're doing it

468
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,920
if you browse to them with an ad blocker

469
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:04,320
enabled it'll give you redirect you to

470
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,140
page and I'll say so you're using a web

471
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,540
browser we really you know we need to

472
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,790
monetize this in some way learn about

473
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,830
how we can learn monetize the other way

474
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,780
by clicking this link and if you click

475
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,030
the learn more link it automatically

476
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,560
starts crypto mining so while you're

477
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:23,220
learning they've already started doing

478
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:27,720
it in the background which is also semi

479
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:31,550
ethical bad business but really what you

480
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,720
want to do is you want to yes how much

481
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:36,210
does your performance change on your

482
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:42,270
browser or on your PC whether you get

483
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:46,320
you know coin hive or Manero basically

484
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:49,170
it's gonna peg the CPU at least half the

485
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,060
cores so if you have like a four core

486
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:55,680
machine it's probably a peg to the CPUs

487
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:58,440
so that at the bottom the OPSEC downside

488
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,390
that that's the big problem so if you

489
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,610
open task manager and all the sudden you

490
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:04,920
see that two of your CPUs or semi idle

491
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,870
and two are totally pegged I mean you'll

492
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,790
also probably like here the fans going

493
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,830
that's your first indication that

494
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:13,670
something's wrong so these kind of

495
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,810
attacks are pretty difficult to hide

496
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:18,240
because it doesn't take any special

497
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:19,770
forensic digging to find this it's not

498
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:25,530
like a rootkit that's sitting in your

499
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:28,020
kernel so one the early attacks and when

500
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:29,520
one the best ones was a Showtime so

501
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,918
someone popped

502
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,830
they modified the webpage and started

503
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,990
serving crypto coin hives specifically

504
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:39,570
and that's like the ideal use case you

505
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,340
want long session times people are going

506
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:45,570
to come on your webpage and stay for a

507
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:47,250
long time so like that kind of video

508
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:50,809
streaming service would be ideal or

509
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,809
audio streaming something like that

510
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:56,730
another interesting use case was someone

511
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,090
found it in a Starbucks Argentina

512
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:01,649
someone had exploited the router so you

513
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:05,879
connect to the free Wi-Fi

514
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:08,250
someone's exploited that and inside the

515
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,620
proxy basically they're rewriting all

516
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:14,100
your HTTP requests and they're inserting

517
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:16,770
the coin hive code into it so there's

518
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,110
really no way to get around that maybe

519
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:23,820
someday Comcast might pick up on that or

520
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:26,750
whatever dubious ISP you'll see this in

521
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,250
phony mobile phone apps you know

522
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,850
flashlight apps all these generic things

523
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:34,740
are a great way to insert minors in you

524
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:36,770
know grandma might not know she might

525
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,649
want to app and pick the first one

526
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:43,350
I'm not convinced that this is a great

527
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:46,260
business case some of the numbers I've

528
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:47,389
seen suggest that you'll get like a hash

529
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,740
a second to the measure

530
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,899
you'll get roughly thirty hashes a

531
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,970
second so if you could do that all day

532
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:58,979
you'd earn about four cents of Monteiro

533
00:23:53,970 --> 00:24:00,480
so figure you need to keep what the

534
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,940
equivalent enough people to keep

535
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,470
constant processing all day long and you

536
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,409
need thousands and thousands of people

537
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:11,460
to make dozens or hundreds of dollars

538
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:13,049
I'm not sure yet where the money is

539
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,919
actually going or if they're actually

540
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:19,049
making all that money so the worm said I

541
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:23,059
talked about the minor spreaders they've

542
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:25,740
been around for a while the adult COEs

543
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:27,240
how're you pronounce that that was the

544
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,909
one that was going on at the same time

545
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,059
as wanna cry so wanna cry was the

546
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:35,909
ransomware that demanded the Bitcoin

547
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:39,450
that has been tentatively linked to

548
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:41,159
North Korean threat actors and that was

549
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,690
an interesting scenario in that no one

550
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,060
bothered to collect the ransom

551
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:47,250
a long time so I talked about having

552
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,530
lots of data and having poor conclusions

553
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,960
that's an example of a situation where

554
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:55,770
we know a lot but we can't understand

555
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,860
very much and I mean the most recent

556
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:02,160
attacks are from just a couple weeks ago

557
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:03,929
the ADB bug in the Android phones it was

558
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,040
like a week later that that was actually

559
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:09,870
monetized

560
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:12,870
into a miner so we talked about how to

561
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,580
get the victims to make money for you I

562
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,770
think that's the most interesting part

563
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:19,110
of it because that's like the novel use

564
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:21,210
case - exploiting someone's computer it

565
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:22,979
used to be you exploit a computer to

566
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:25,410
either make them a botnet to use their

567
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,150
bandwidth or you exploit a computer to

568
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,770
steal their information like their bank

569
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,260
or their credit card information and

570
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:33,629
resell that but now you can literally

571
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:36,540
use someone's electricity to make money

572
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:38,100
for you so that's that's what I find to

573
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,129
be really interesting it's a whole new

574
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,919
use case this is the old use case

575
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:47,940
straight theft but that seems to be

576
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:50,460
where the money is the wallet providers

577
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,140
have gotten smart they're like banks in

578
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,590
that they offer multi-factor

579
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,480
authentication now so like your cell

580
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,939
phone you can use as the out-of-band

581
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,800
communication or your email something

582
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,650
like that

583
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:07,919
so the attackers have actually moved on

584
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:10,170
to do voice phishing SMS phishing

585
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,440
attacking these channels in conjunction

586
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:15,390
to regular phishing attacks so

587
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,870
multi-part sophisticated attacks to get

588
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:20,640
into your wallets but the exchanges are

589
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:23,899
like the banks and hitting the bank is

590
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,390
where the money actually is mount GOx

591
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:31,140
hundreds of millions of dollars coin

592
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:32,790
check is still very new I don't have a

593
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,650
lot of good information on that yet but

594
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:37,700
it's looking like it might exceed mount

595
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:40,790
Cox in the amount that it was hit for

596
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:43,590
one of the interesting use cases or

597
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:46,879
situations is the distributed autonomous

598
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:49,740
organization it was built on aetherium

599
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,380
theorem is significantly different from

600
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,240
Bitcoin in that aetherium has a full

601
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,010
virtual machine like kind of like the

602
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,930
java virtual machine

603
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,840
if you are on the etherium network

604
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,580
you're running this full virtual machine

605
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:06,209
what it does is allows people to write

606
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:08,580
distributed applications so they can

607
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:10,620
distribute processing load or they can

608
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,710
distribute storage and you're rewarded

609
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,949
in the ether currency well

610
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:20,910
Dao was a crowdsourced venture capital

611
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:23,540
investment fund that had a logic flaw in

612
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,410
its smart contract logic and

613
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,500
specifically in the transaction

614
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:33,060
processing and it lets someone get away

615
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:35,910
with about 50 million and the solution

616
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:38,940
they came up with was called a hard fork

617
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:41,130
which was after the dao got hacked the

618
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,090
developers decided well the only way to

619
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:47,340
recover the money is to undo all the

620
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:50,070
transactions after that theft

621
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:53,850
so they created essentially a whole new

622
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:56,370
currency they hard forked it and undid

623
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:59,340
they took the fork back to before the

624
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:01,409
attack happened so now you have a

625
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:04,370
theorem and you have etherium classic

626
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:08,190
where classic still has this this

627
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:13,860
transaction in it so that was an

628
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:16,380
interesting scenario the Aiko's a lot of

629
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,330
people the irony is that these are

630
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,750
systems built on cryptography and

631
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:24,270
provable trust but people are so rabid

632
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,680
to buy into these initial coin offerings

633
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:29,040
that they don't know who they're dealing

634
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:32,040
with and so it becomes pretty easy for

635
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,930
someone to fish and aiko and basically

636
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,060
just be like oh yeah I can tell you this

637
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:37,170
coin or this token and people will just

638
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,929
throw their money to these people

639
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:43,440
without checking it out and surprise it

640
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:46,350
it turns out to be fake and well though

641
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,660
in funny situations was someone sent a

642
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,370
physical letter I like a handwritten

643
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,290
letter saying basically I know what you

644
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:54,989
did last summer you know kind of vague

645
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:58,080
on the details but ominous demanding

646
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:01,550
cryptocurrency payment so this that goes

647
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:06,270
way back to like the Nigerian scammers

648
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:09,330
this is one of my favorite attacks so

649
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:12,090
what happened was the attacker was

650
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,580
providing there hosting within tour The

651
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,350
Onion Router tour is a logical address

652
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:20,550
based not accessible from the internet

653
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:23,010
by design they did their ransomware

654
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,830
attack so they got the ransomware out on

655
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:27,450
machines and the if you ever see a

656
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,980
ransomware it'll come up with a

657
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,480
screenshot saying

658
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,450
sucks to be you here are the

659
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,530
instructions for how you undo this so

660
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:39,450
the victim said okay I'll pay the ransom

661
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:41,399
but the web page is hosted at tor so

662
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:43,710
you've got to use a proxy that sits

663
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:47,790
between the regular Internet and the Tor

664
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:49,350
network the ransomware was then supposed

665
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:51,540
to go through you go to the web page

666
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:54,959
gives you the Bitcoin address and then

667
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:57,810
you pay them pay the ransom it didn't

668
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,870
happen that way because the actual proxy

669
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:03,360
that sat between the internet and tor

670
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:05,699
had like all you need is regex it would

671
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,490
recognize when someone was including a

672
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,320
Bitcoin address in a web page and

673
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:13,350
rewrite every Bitcoin address to be

674
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,210
their Bitcoin address so you were

675
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:17,159
essentially paying the proxy and the

676
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:21,480
actual attacker behind the ransomware

677
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,800
never even got their money and they

678
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,100
eventually caught on to this and

679
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:28,230
realized that the customer friendliness

680
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,300
of using the proxy was actually

681
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,920
undermining their profit so now they

682
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,629
have like these guides for you know

683
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,570
here's how you download the tor browser

684
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,500
and it's real step-by-step stuff and

685
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:44,220
some have like uh

686
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:46,950
help desks basically fraud this is like

687
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,350
Wild West stuff it's it's unregulated

688
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:52,320
I mean cryptocurrency was set up to be

689
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:54,780
this kind of libertarian ideal we are

690
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,990
free from the central banks in the

691
00:30:54,780 --> 00:31:00,649
central financial decision makers well

692
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:03,570
it's kind of a double-edged sword

693
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:05,940
you'll read a lot about ICO zikos our

694
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,950
initial coin offerings there they're

695
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,740
meant to be like initial public

696
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:14,450
offerings in the stock market only they

697
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:19,050
create a new currency usually on top of

698
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:21,420
aetherium and then you can buy into that

699
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:22,770
and people use it either to actually

700
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,240
like as

701
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,980
start up the start a service or

702
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,560
basically just as a fundraising

703
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:31,800
mechanism because essentially these this

704
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:35,250
isn't currency this is actual financial

705
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,720
instruments like a stock in the number

706
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:40,350
of situations in which this has gone on

707
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:43,830
have been ridiculous the guy up in the

708
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:47,370
right is a spokesman for the big canet

709
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:48,840
bit connect Ponzi scheme if you haven't

710
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:51,419
seen them on youtube yet you probably

711
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:55,470
will before too long

712
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:57,990
if anyone guarantees you a guaranteed

713
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:01,110
return in an investment it's a lie I

714
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:03,120
mean I'm not I'm not a talented investor

715
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,310
but I can tell you if anyone says I can

716
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,250
guarantee five 10% return on your

717
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:11,490
investment know that they're they're

718
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:13,830
lying to you but it's not just limited

719
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:16,650
to these small-time no-name crypto

720
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:18,929
offerings there's some interesting

721
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:20,760
research going on as to whether or not

722
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:24,360
the Bitcoin price has been artificially

723
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,610
inflated by automated bot software and

724
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,250
there's some compelling evidence as to

725
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:35,939
whether or not that happened this was a

726
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:38,250
couple years ago so we want this we want

727
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,110
this cryptocurrency to be money we want

728
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:43,890
it to be an actual medium of exchange

729
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:45,179
and not just an investment but the

730
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:48,750
government really wants to know where

731
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:50,730
this money is going so they want to be

732
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:54,450
able to track large exchanges wire

733
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:58,740
transfers remittances informal money

734
00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:01,050
lending the money laundering process in

735
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,760
cryptocurrency it's like ridiculously

736
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:06,149
easy easy

737
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,950
you've got Bitcoin just throw it through

738
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:10,080
another currency you might pay a little

739
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:12,480
bit in the fees but bring it back into

740
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,580
Bitcoin it's clean there's also

741
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,880
something in Bitcoin called tumbling

742
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:21,689
services which is basically they create

743
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,400
a bunch of small transfers so you put

744
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,990
your money into the tumbling service and

745
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,510
it gets mixed back and forth of all

746
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:28,800
these transfers it's about the most

747
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:31,410
literal metaphor to money laundering

748
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:34,050
I've ever seen and you get it back out

749
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:35,940
and now they can't really trace it back

750
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:38,250
to your wallet

751
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:41,250
there's some evidence to terror funding

752
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:43,740
but I've seen so very little of that

753
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:46,100
that's hardly on my radar most of what

754
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:50,250
I've been seeing has been straight crime

755
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:52,740
some of it has been suggested to connect

756
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:56,010
to nation-state actors so I picked on

757
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:58,860
North Korea for a bit and some of it

758
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,900
might be evidence of tax evasion which

759
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:03,030
is complicated by the fact that I don't

760
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,700
think the IRS has issued guidance yet on

761
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:07,170
what you need to pay in the United

762
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:10,590
States if you've made money off

763
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:13,770
cryptocurrency so expect that to change

764
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:15,780
once someone figures out the problem so

765
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:18,719
we have a couple months left I'll go

766
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:21,080
through these slides real quick this is

767
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,850
one of my favorite things to follow

768
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:26,429
Venezuela the nation has created its own

769
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:29,790
cryptocurrency because their actual

770
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:32,520
currency is garbage more or less the

771
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:35,130
official exchange rate is about 3,000

772
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,168
Bulevar to the dollar black market it's

773
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:38,060
two hundred and twenty six thousand to

774
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:40,500
the dollar

775
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:46,590
people are getting literally paid in

776
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:49,130
cartons of eggs so if I was a lawyer for

777
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:51,960
someone who held large amounts of debt

778
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:53,730
from the Venezuelan government I'd be

779
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,139
getting pretty upset about this right

780
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,440
now because it seems like a way to

781
00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:02,580
circumvent debt payments and bring in

782
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:04,860
new currency the biggest problem that

783
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:09,080
all cryptocurrencies are going to face

784
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:11,940
is scalability some of that is utility

785
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,580
the processors like Visa and MasterCard

786
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:19,290
are faster than Bitcoin by about a

787
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:23,310
factor of 3 so Bitcoin has a huge huge

788
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:25,259
hurdle to to cross yet the fees

789
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,520
associated with Bitcoin as it's gone

790
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,950
exponentially higher have been

791
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,500
ridiculous used to be able to use it on

792
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:33,210
steam to buy video games and they

793
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,770
dropped it because the fees were getting

794
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:39,210
ridiculous and the volatility if you

795
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:41,730
actually look at the Wikipedia state

796
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:44,190
page talking about the gold standard a

797
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,750
lot of the things the problems with the

798
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:50,050
gold standard are gonna sound eerily

799
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:53,040
familiar to cryptocurrencies the limited

800
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:55,720
of people who control the currency a

801
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,520
fixed supply of the currency so on so

802
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,049
forth

803
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:02,170
and I talked about what happened with

804
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:03,970
aetherium in terms of we're gonna make

805
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:06,310
the decision to revert the whole ledger

806
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:09,370
just so people these other people can

807
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,960
get their money back there have been

808
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,759
other splits in the last year

809
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,710
people have been splitting off Bitcoin

810
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,050
as they disagree with like the design

811
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:19,810
decisions that went into it

812
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:22,630
things that might not make sense or seem

813
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:25,870
important if you just want to use it as

814
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:28,720
money and the speculation the

815
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:32,080
speculation is just ridiculous I can't

816
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,209
read any post on reddit about Bitcoin

817
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,009
specifically or any cryptocurrency in

818
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:42,460
general because half of half of them are

819
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:44,350
memes half of them are just fanboys this

820
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:46,720
guy up well I don't know if it's a guy

821
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:49,600
this is a clipping actually from my

822
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,180
local caramel paper so there's a there's

823
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,790
an office down in Carmel that's willing

824
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:57,100
to help invest in Bitcoin and

825
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:59,920
cryptocurrencies for you this is their

826
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:02,830
second ad I lost the first one I like

827
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,810
the buy the dip because it's an

828
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:06,730
admission that you know the value has

829
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:09,060
really dropped but that's okay that's

830
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:11,650
just the sign that you need to buy now

831
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,650
the fine print is a little smudged but

832
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:16,960
basically they say you have to have

833
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:18,760
$100,000 to invest or we won't talk to

834
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,600
you and you have to have a net worth of

835
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:24,790
over two million dollars so I'm a little

836
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,640
dubious about that they also haven't

837
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:29,410
responded to my requests I want to

838
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,779
actually sit down with them and ask them

839
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:34,180
about like the security challenges they

840
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:37,840
face and we haven't been able to connect

841
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:41,379
yet the two most recent problems have

842
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:44,310
come up are do you remember distributed

843
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:47,620
processing services like SETI at home or

844
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:51,100
protein folding they're actually seeing

845
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:53,020
a dip in available CPU usage as people

846
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,970
take their computers to make money

847
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:58,660
they're less interested in finding

848
00:37:54,970 --> 00:38:01,660
aliens or finding cancer drugs and the

849
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:04,089
other problem that it's just starting to

850
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:06,640
become significant is that

851
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:08,500
environment so yeah we're using

852
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,480
electricity but you know that out

853
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,420
electricity is coming some from

854
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:17,590
somewhere there's some kind of carbon

855
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:18,880
dioxide and produced as a result so

856
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:24,610
we're starting to be able to measure

857
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:27,610
that impact in the environment and the

858
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:29,320
speculation I love this the Long Island

859
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:31,390
iced tea company changed their name to

860
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,640
long block chain corporation and their

861
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:35,740
stock price tripled like they they had

862
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,420
no they had no business plan ready

863
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:40,120
they're just like oh we're getting into

864
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,830
blockchain and the price shot up like

865
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:45,910
this is the actual stock market this

866
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:49,720
isn't like Bitcoin kodak kind of has a

867
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:52,390
plan going but you know Kodak's been

868
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:55,060
slowly dying Maersk actually has an

869
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:58,330
interesting idea in terms of logistics

870
00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:00,940
and tracking which seems to dovetail

871
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:03,910
well with the distributed nature of the

872
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:06,100
blockchain but keep in mind Maersk was

873
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:09,759
one of the biggest victims affected by

874
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:12,759
the not Pecha ransomware attack so I'm a

875
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:16,330
little skeptical maybe bringing IBM on

876
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:20,740
will help but what really embodies my

877
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:22,480
problem with speculation is dogecoin it

878
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:25,270
was a crypto currency that was a joke

879
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:29,230
and now it's 2 billion dollars and that

880
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:33,520
is the actual dogecoin sponsored NASCAR

881
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:37,630
entry and for some reason is taking on a

882
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,520
life of its own so what can you take

883
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:43,900
away from this today what can you make

884
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:46,330
use of keep your systems patched I mean

885
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,060
at the time wanna cry came out Microsoft

886
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:51,400
had patched those as some be bugs for

887
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,990
several months a year later those same

888
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,750
bugs are still being exploited by

889
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:59,830
ransomware encrypt and minor worms over

890
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:02,530
a year later that that's unacceptable if

891
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:04,710
you a multi-factor authentication use it

892
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:08,440
it's not going to make you bulletproof

893
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:11,530
but every step you can make to harden

894
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:15,780
your perimeter and add defense-in-depth

895
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:17,710
is going to help watch for unusual

896
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,320
utilization rates

897
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:22,420
your computer suddenly slows down if it

898
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:25,030
sounds like your fans are cranking

899
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:29,859
pretty hard maybe check out task manager

900
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:32,800
and see what's running the best way to

901
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:34,420
prevent phishing attacks is regular and

902
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,770
recurring awareness training that's

903
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,990
probably not something you're going to

904
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:41,050
encounter much here at Purdue but as you

905
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:42,279
go out into the industry education

906
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,780
awareness is about the only thing that

907
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,730
can save you you could buy every

908
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:48,010
perimeter device and still the most

909
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:49,990
effective thing is education and

910
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:53,349
awareness and actually I get fished by

911
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:56,109
my own company a couple times a year so

912
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:57,640
we'll get a kind of suspicious email and

913
00:40:56,109 --> 00:41:00,400
you're supposed to click on the the

914
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,810
phishing button and if you get it right

915
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,849
it pops up with a message saying

916
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:06,790
congratulations you're you're not an

917
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:08,800
idiot you picked the phishing email and

918
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:11,980
sometimes I click that on emails and

919
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,170
it's like oh well that wasn't a test so

920
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:18,369
we'll just forward this on and blacklist

921
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:20,349
it for you as a nerd I'm really excited

922
00:41:18,369 --> 00:41:23,740
by the possibilities of cryptocurrency

923
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:27,060
technology but I have not seen it

924
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:30,189
utilized really effectively yet it seems

925
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:32,470
holding to the speculation and until

926
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:36,250
such a time as like the really killer

927
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:38,259
business cases developed I'm not sure

928
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,330
that it's really gonna fulfill its true

929
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:44,099
potential and I find that to be kind of

930
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:47,859
disappointing so here's hoping and

931
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:50,410
that's all I had prepared you have about

932
00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:54,130
five minutes left if anybody has any

933
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:57,220
questions did like so so Courtney is

934
00:41:54,130 --> 00:42:00,010
this one of your growing campaigns that

935
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:02,950
comes up on your radar do you see this

936
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:04,349
consuming more time than some of the

937
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:08,439
other threats that are out there

938
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:12,490
not yet I mean the ransomware is still

939
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:15,970
the biggest focus this is still kind of

940
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:18,220
diffuse I mean we talked about several

941
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:22,598
different vectors of attack several

942
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:26,140
different technologies but it's becoming

943
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:28,240
more and more common so one of the

944
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:30,848
things we try to produce are small

945
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,540
pieces of machine readable intelligence

946
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:34,540
in

947
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:36,940
caters to compromise so we we try to

948
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,410
keep that up to date such that if if

949
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,850
someone runs across one of these things

950
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:44,430
and it gets installed on the machines

951
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:44,430
self detectives sooner things like that

952
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,100
any other questions

953
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,590
yes I don't understand what is it

954
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:58,300
cryptocurrency that what is the support

955
00:42:56,590 --> 00:43:00,040
behind it because if you have some

956
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,470
currency there's somebody who has to

957
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,920
support it otherwise it doesn't mean

958
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:09,850
anything

959
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:12,990
so correct essentially speculation I

960
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:16,000
mean some crypto currencies like

961
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:18,970
Venezuela's they talked about it being

962
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,380
backed by their natural resources their

963
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:24,310
oil and their diamonds and their

964
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:28,260
gasoline how that works isn't really

965
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:33,150
clear that might be like buying a future

966
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:36,100
or another security like you can buy oil

967
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:39,330
futures so on and so forth but things

968
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:42,580
like Bitcoin the the price is entirely

969
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:44,980
it's more like stocks it's entirely

970
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:48,700
based on what people value it at

971
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:50,620
personally and that's what makes it

972
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:56,109
vulnerable to exploitation by things

973
00:43:50,620 --> 00:44:00,370
like bots a lot of do you know about

974
00:43:56,110 --> 00:44:02,470
penny stocks yeah so a lot of the really

975
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:04,870
small coins are vulnerable to pump and

976
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:07,270
dump the same way as penny stocks are

977
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:09,520
and pump and dump is where one person

978
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,410
like the wolf of Wall Street movie what

979
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,690
they were doing with pump and dump they

980
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:15,670
would get a lot of excitement they bring

981
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:18,040
people in to invest in a coin they

982
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:18,580
already own what the price goes up the

983
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,000
original

984
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:24,759
pumpers sell it out for a profit and

985
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,790
leave people behind with a devalued

986
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:31,360
currency so it's it's all perception at

987
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:32,920
this point so business everything is

988
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,290
virtual you don't have anything to

989
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,740
basically show for some people they buy

990
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:41,650
it but as I said when they talk about

991
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:44,180
these resistance levels or whatever all

992
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:48,619
of it all of a sudden from 20,000

993
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:50,960
6000 and they said it doesn't make sense

994
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:55,069
to me at least I don't understand it

995
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,750
No and I I didn't take economics so I

996
00:44:55,069 --> 00:45:00,788
can't give you a good economics

997
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:02,299
explanation other than speculation

998
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:03,950
sometimes when they talk about

999
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:06,799
resistance level it's based on a

1000
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:09,140
technical analysis yeah which may have

1001
00:45:06,799 --> 00:45:10,460
nothing to do with fundamentals yes oh

1002
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,650
you can look at it technically and say

1003
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:14,109
oh yeah keeps hitting this point going

1004
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:17,569
back up that must be a resistance point

1005
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:19,190
or or you know or a support point

1006
00:45:17,569 --> 00:45:20,808
depending upon which flame but that

1007
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:23,029
doesn't mean fundamentally it's no solid

1008
00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:25,549
it just appears that way yeah well I

1009
00:45:23,029 --> 00:45:26,869
know about that I'm just saying because

1010
00:45:25,549 --> 00:45:28,430
when they're talking about the existence

1011
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:31,400
of it or something yeah yeah

1012
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:33,109
prove you something or your profit goes

1013
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,779
down or somebody everything over here is

1014
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:37,160
just virtual you don't have anything to

1015
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:39,230
show where the toy and you don't know

1016
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:42,140
whether it is right or not is lie or is

1017
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:45,079
not lie for what it is I don't know well

1018
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:47,509
and you see these indicators of problems

1019
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:51,289
and things like the high volatility my

1020
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:54,859
Bitcoin faring by $10,000 in a matter of

1021
00:45:51,289 --> 00:45:57,980
months or at one point the South Korean

1022
00:45:54,859 --> 00:46:00,020
government was going to ban crypto

1023
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:03,230
currency exchanges in South Korea and

1024
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:04,880
the Bitcoin price dropped and then a day

1025
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:07,549
later the South Korean government said

1026
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:12,049
no we never said that that's total rumor

1027
00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:13,819
so on on this rumor it affected the

1028
00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:15,859
price of this currency by thousands of

1029
00:46:13,819 --> 00:46:23,890
dollars and that doesn't speak to strong

1030
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:26,810
fundamentals to me here are questions

1031
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:29,980
terrific thank you thank you

1032
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:29,980
[Applause]

1033
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,549
you
