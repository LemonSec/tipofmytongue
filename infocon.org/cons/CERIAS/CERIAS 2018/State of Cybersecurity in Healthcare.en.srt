1
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:12,440
health my primary functions and duties

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,270
are to service medical equipment I

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,780
maintain them in every aspect I

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,910
calibrate the equipment so in essence I

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,800
am NOT an engineer I don't design or

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,509
implement but I take care of maintain

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,560
the equipment's in the hospital so for

8
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:25,970
instance the images you see on the

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,269
screen there's there's numerous devices

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,710
right there so within those devices I am

11
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:32,809
responsible for like I said ensuring

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,910
patient safety patient care the safe and

13
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,500
effective use of the devices I assist

14
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,800
with the setup of the devices

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,019
occasionally I'll proceed with utilizing

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,169
the devices with the physician and staff

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,879
who need assistance with those devices

18
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,500
I'm also an adjunct professor at IEP Y

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,839
so I've taught for healthcare

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,070
engineering technology management in the

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,739
program they have their teaching

22
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,600
biomedical equipment technicians some

23
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:59,178
basic entry-level courses along with

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,039
some higher-level courses I've taught

25
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:02,420
for the CIT department over at IEP you

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,269
are as well teaching some basic

27
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,520
networking fundamentals some security

28
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:09,140
fundamentals as well I'm also a

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,060
researcher so I work I do a little bit

30
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,670
of work for some not-for-profit

31
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,470
organizations they do there they're more

32
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,530
in depth in research and design they're

33
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:21,620
looking at cybersecurity within medical

34
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,420
devices and systems so the research is

35
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,600
driven to find what vulnerabilities

36
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,370
exist how can we mitigate and really

37
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,610
developing a framework and a plan as we

38
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:34,520
move forward here in the future so with

39
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,289
this this presentation I I don't want to

40
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,300
treat it as a lecture I'd like more of a

41
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,190
discussion if you have any questions I

42
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,830
again I'm from the healthcare field so I

43
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,910
may use acronyms I may say phrases or

44
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,570
things that don't make any sense

45
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,310
whatsoever

46
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:54,070
if you encounter something like that

47
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:54,070
please stop me and ask okay yes sir yes

48
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:14,280
yes there are presidential directives in

49
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,320
order to help a kree increase awareness

50
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,520
they've and I've got a whole slide on

51
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,739
that that I'll cover a little bit more

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,990
but yes there are initiatives to

53
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,030
increase the awareness they're trying to

54
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:27,210
fund money into programs to increase

55
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,740
education also they're trying to they're

56
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,140
looking at more the manufacturing side

57
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,510
almost from the embedded side where when

58
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:39,079
the devices are being developed what the

59
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,079
manufacturers should look into yes sir

60
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:49,290
not yet not yet that's the challenge so

61
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,080
we're we in healthcare it's a little bit

62
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,269
different so it's hard we have to again

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,070
work with patients and patient safety so

64
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,050
some of those standards as far as the

65
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,359
healthcare atmosphere within within a

66
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,190
delivery organization are different now

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,260
through manufacturing is some of the

68
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,400
other critical infrastructures yes they

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,040
have adopted some of those practices

70
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,510
okay so every you know you've mentioned

71
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,679
the critical infrastructure and as a

72
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,149
whole and I do have a slide on here

73
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,420
indicating you know all the different

74
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,130
facets of healthcare and so when I also

75
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,929
talk about some of the numbers or

76
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,850
project some of the numbers I'm

77
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,290
referring to the critical infrastructure

78
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,430
as a whole you know so when we talk

79
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,709
about some of the attacks where they

80
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,660
came from you know the the high dollars

81
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,190
and values it's not just from a health

82
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,670
care delivery organization or a hospital

83
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:36,090
it's like I said from all so I'll jump

84
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,769
into that here in just a moment okay so

85
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,150
the evolution of healthcare it's

86
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,770
drastically changed it's different than

87
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,770
it was 10 years ago let alone 30 years

88
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:46,709
ago so we are fast paced and we were

89
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:50,370
looking to get our devices to market we

90
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:52,200
want to increase patient safety increase

91
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,060
patient satisfaction we want to ease

92
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,459
workflow for clinicians make physicians

93
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,290
happy there's a lot of factors here so

94
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,540
with the evolution of healthcare come

95
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,620
the latest and greatest technologies I

96
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,350
mean everything from

97
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,049
radiotherapy to different kinds of MRIs

98
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:10,108
and and technologies to help increase

99
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,130
like I say patient care so here's a kind

100
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:15,090
of a broad overview

101
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:17,399
of our national infrastructure in

102
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,640
healthcare so like I said when I talk

103
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,500
about some of the the intrusions we've

104
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,729
had some of the numbers and figures they

105
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,050
come from all of this so you can see we

106
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,240
have laboratories blood and

107
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,740
pharmaceuticals and they just come from

108
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,420
anything from drugstore chains to blood

109
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,970
banks any kind of association with those

110
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,280
organizations we have medical materials

111
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,160
so device manufacturers distributors

112
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,679
things like that health information

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,410
technology so well the biggest here is

114
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,760
electronic medical record systems right

115
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,680
now those are the biggest players in the

116
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,780
market as we have moved forward to

117
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,300
having every healthcare organization we

118
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,469
can move into electronic medical records

119
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,940
and integration and interoperability

120
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,160
federal response programs so we have

121
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,020
coordinated response activities and

122
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,840
other federal partners including the

123
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,609
Department of Homeland Security and we

124
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,530
have our direct patient care which

125
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,140
include healthcare systems professional

126
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:13,440
associations medical facilities and

127
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:16,560
consumers and consumer devices and some

128
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,320
medical emergency services mass fatality

129
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,600
management services we have our health

130
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,159
plans and play payers excuse me

131
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,110
this is the other big factor you're

132
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,060
going to see a lot of focused in that

133
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,040
area because those are our covered

134
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,210
entities those are our third parties

135
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,860
that we deal with that healthcare

136
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,930
organizations deal with that's who pays

137
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,060
our medical claims that's where a lot of

138
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,530
our information is stored so if the

139
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,450
hospital doesn't have it it's sitting

140
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,789
with these payers and other providers

141
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:43,320
the clearing houses and whatnot that are

142
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,170
behind closed doors that you guys don't

143
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,820
typically see and again our public

144
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:51,900
health and our public health sector so

145
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,940
governmental public health services so

146
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,190
when we talk about healthcare when we

147
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,480
think about healthcare we think of some

148
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,620
of the latest and greatest technology

149
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,410
and as you can see here it looks like

150
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,790
these physician or surgeon is wearing a

151
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,990
VR headset performing surgery the

152
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,520
healthcare industry and and and where

153
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,990
we've moved with our devices is an

154
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,180
unparallel I mean it's drastically

155
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:16,620
changing we are trying our best to

156
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:21,360
increase revenue increase patient safety

157
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:24,270
at the same time increase our create

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,720
less invasive procedures to increase and

159
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,680
if

160
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,300
see and patient safety and satisfaction

161
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,800
so the medical device industry is about

162
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,060
two hundred twenty eight billion dollar

163
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,380
industry right now they estimate by the

164
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,760
2020 the year 2020

165
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:44,250
it'll be about four hundred and forty

166
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:46,560
seven billion dollar industry so for a

167
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,660
lot of medical devices the approach is

168
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,310
first to market we want cutting-edge we

169
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,890
want first to market our medical devices

170
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,530
are turning into IOT s or they have many

171
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:57,090
other definitions right now but about

172
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,619
fifteen percent of all medical devices

173
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,760
are smart they have some sort of

174
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,190
interoperability some sort of

175
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,190
communication built in we want our

176
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,270
devices wireless we want them ZigBee

177
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:10,890
however we can to get them to

178
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:12,810
communicate um so healthcare delivery

179
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,919
organizations and hospitals also have

180
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,470
about three hundred to four hundred

181
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,919
percent more medical equipment than IT

182
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:21,330
devices so again as i bring up those

183
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,180
numbers and facts and figures that i'll

184
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:26,010
get to here momentarily most of this has

185
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,230
nothing to do with an actual medical

186
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,400
device a therapy device a diagnostic

187
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,070
device it has everything to do with the

188
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,460
IT systems the front end facing servers

189
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:37,590
the web servers the all those so those

190
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,719
are our basic IT systems so we haven't

191
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,090
even touched what could possibly happen

192
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,470
once we get to these three a hundred to

193
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,200
four hundred percent more medical

194
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,630
devices that are in a facility the

195
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,280
global smart medical device market is

196
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,680
worth about sixty six billion right now

197
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,080
or excuse me by 2024 compared to thirty

198
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,550
three point seven billion in 2015 that's

199
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,919
four smart devices devices that are

200
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,470
communicating the devices that currently

201
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,349
aren't communicating we are looking at

202
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:06,660
ways or we have implemented ways

203
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:08,700
middleware to create interoperability to

204
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,290
get these devices to talk we have

205
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,940
devices there are ten fifteen years old

206
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,970
that have serial outputs they have ways

207
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,620
of delivering information we just use a

208
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,020
piece of middleware to extract that

209
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,970
information to put it on the network so

210
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,460
yes 15 percent of medical devices are

211
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,900
now smart but reality about seventy

212
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:29,070
percent of them were trying to get to

213
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:31,229
communicate some way shape or form so

214
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,479
technology is driving healthcare

215
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:35,189
delivery so we talk about m health or

216
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,169
mobile health i don't know if you guys

217
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,400
have seen commercials you've seen you've

218
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,900
gone to your physician you

219
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,250
to your providers and they're trying to

220
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,590
push your my chart they're trying to

221
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,960
push you get online check your stuff why

222
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:48,470
don't you download an app we live in a

223
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,580
digital era where our patients lack

224
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,780
communication they lack awareness they

225
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,180
lack an understanding of their own

226
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,589
health physicians if you ever know if

227
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,910
you realize they don't really spend a

228
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,950
whole lot of time with you they don't

229
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,719
get much time with you maybe 15 minutes

230
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,550
if you're lucky so what they often try

231
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,500
to do is is get you to utilize these

232
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,939
tools tools that you have in your pocket

233
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,110
tools that you have at home to kind of

234
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,540
monitor yourself

235
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,820
so the EM health is the newest digital

236
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,740
era of things you know so being able to

237
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,110
download applications being able to

238
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,340
monitor input your information

239
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:19,020
physicians can now even electronically

240
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:22,110
communicate with you with those apps

241
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,670
they can view that information we'll get

242
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,880
to the security side of that in just a

243
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:29,040
moment but we also have telemedicine we

244
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,930
have rural communities that simply can't

245
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,890
have physicians on-site they're just not

246
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,170
staffed for that

247
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,810
so with these rural communities we often

248
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,370
utilize telemedicine so if you need a

249
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,530
diagnostic procedure done you need a

250
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,210
computer tomography scan done or an MRI

251
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,890
scan done they may not have a

252
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,560
radiologist on-site so they'll fax

253
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,990
excuse me they will send that

254
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,180
information out whether it be to a

255
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,280
Nighthawk anywhere that that individual

256
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,870
or that organization could be in India

257
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,120
they could be in some other country they

258
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,250
could be again anywhere wherever they

259
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,190
contract with because it's cheaper it's

260
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,900
easier we'll pay per scan or we'll pay

261
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,960
per reading rather than have a staff

262
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,819
physician on-site then we have our

263
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,530
electronic health record which is right

264
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,240
now our massive digital Eretz our

265
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,160
digital warehousing our big data and

266
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,960
analytics we're gonna get to a point

267
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,189
we're gonna be warehousing so much

268
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,420
information we're not even gonna know

269
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,440
what to do with it and when someone does

270
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,959
get their hands on it like they are

271
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,700
currently it's worth it's invaluable

272
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,010
there's so much money involved in this

273
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,990
we don't even know how to handle this in

274
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,670
the healthcare industry we've got so

275
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,250
many players to the game coming along

276
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:35,969
trying to get and having you install and

277
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:37,350
sell EHR systems that we don't often

278
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,930
know what happens we don't know where it

279
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,280
goes we don't know how to set it up so

280
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,079
you have a lot of small-time healthcare

281
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,360
providers in rural communities again

282
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,400
that aren't involved with these larger

283
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,660
organizations like IU Health or you know

284
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,319
those kinds of organizations for my

285
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,419
organization so they'll buy a small time

286
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,799
electronic health record system from a

287
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:57,600
small vendor it's a little bit cheaper

288
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,829
for them that vendor may be somewhere

289
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,139
else they may store that in the cloud

290
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:03,029
they may not have patient privacy in

291
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,729
place we don't know but that's what's

292
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:08,939
happening as more providers and more are

293
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:10,799
jumping on board with EHRs and in social

294
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:12,779
media we share everything now don't wait

295
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,009
we share absolutely everything we put it

296
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,359
on the Internet we put it everywhere

297
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:17,789
we're doing the same thing with our

298
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:19,949
health information so the social media

299
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:22,139
kind of boils back down to the mobile

300
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:24,839
health as well but that's where a lot of

301
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:26,970
the that's where health care is going so

302
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,160
you can see the tablet there you know

303
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,929
our our ambulance drivers they're

304
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,549
inputting your information on a tablet

305
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:34,139
as they're bringing you to the hospital

306
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:36,029
so by the time you arrive to the

307
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:37,769
hospital the physicians there he's got

308
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,720
it he's got a general idea of what's

309
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:41,759
going on the signs and symptoms so they

310
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,329
can get you moving a little faster into

311
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,329
the facility

312
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:48,720
now implantable medical devices the next

313
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,939
greatest thing it's been around for many

314
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,699
years but the problem is is we're

315
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:55,738
implanting them everywhere now so we can

316
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:58,589
almost take over major bodily functions

317
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:59,970
by implantable medical devices some of

318
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:02,879
you probably know someone who have an

319
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,999
implantable device right now these are a

320
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,619
big security risk because for one once

321
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:09,809
they're surgically installed they don't

322
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:12,569
eat come help very easily they typically

323
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:14,189
last about 10 years in order to get

324
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:16,108
these devices in again they're placed

325
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:17,939
surgically but to make changes or

326
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:20,789
reconfigure them it's usually done

327
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:22,980
wirelessly so our physician will have a

328
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:24,660
programmer or a rep with a physician

329
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,339
we'll have some sort of a programmer

330
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,169
that will wirelessly connect to one of

331
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,689
these devices and when changes are made

332
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:31,829
it's done wirelessly

333
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:33,089
there are several experts in the field

334
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:36,029
who have debunked this and found how

335
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:38,759
easy it is to to crack and hack that and

336
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:40,859
to steal patient information even modify

337
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,669
and make changes to these devices while

338
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:45,929
in vitro while they're in the body

339
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:47,659
medical researchers like dr. Kevin foo

340
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:49,379
he's done numerous studies on

341
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:51,449
implantable pacemakers and

342
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:53,459
defibrillators where he's able to

343
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:55,469
deactivate them wirelessly he's it like

344
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:57,599
I said can make changes so imagine a

345
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,789
family member who's got an implantable

346
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,100
device who can be hacked as they walk as

347
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:04,609
they're sitting on the bus as they're in

348
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,609
their home

349
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:10,540
as I stated we're in a digital amassed

350
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,880
digitization right now we want

351
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,319
everything on the network we don't care

352
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,180
how it gets there that is the model

353
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,370
right now in health care we don't care

354
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,140
get it on the net get the data we want

355
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,990
to extract the data and interpolate it

356
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,490
and put it in our EHR because why darn

357
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:27,310
your every device we have has some sort

358
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,660
of data that we can use so you'll see

359
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,239
lots of devices like I say by using

360
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,280
middleware so at our hospital we have

361
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,180
over 4,800 devices communicating on the

362
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:39,790
network 4,800 really only about 1200 of

363
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,260
them are designed to do so so we have

364
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,610
all these extra pieces of middleware

365
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,410
floating around attached to these

366
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:48,910
devices that can be lost stolen hacked

367
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:50,170
all the above okay so that's that's

368
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,819
where a lot of health care providers are

369
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,530
it's too expensive to replace these

370
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,420
medical devices cost thousands and

371
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,910
thousands of dollars a very simple

372
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,860
device that you would think would be

373
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,390
moderately priced is easy in the

374
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,100
ballpark of five to fifteen thousand

375
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,600
dollars so imagine if you need a few

376
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,000
hundreds a few hundred of these devices

377
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,170
it's just too costly so it's easier to

378
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,750
buy a box and throw it in between this

379
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,800
is another example of what we try to do

380
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,110
when we're trying to connect all

381
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,579
dinosaurs so this is a 40 year old

382
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,080
device you won't find this used anymore

383
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,810
in hospitals but for the sake of the

384
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,310
example I've got a red circle with a

385
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,319
little arrow point to hey we've got a

386
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,939
way of extracting data from this device

387
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,980
let's see if we can get it on the net

388
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,690
that's kind of our job that's our role

389
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,430
right now is trying to get these devices

390
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,790
on the net or excuse me on our network

391
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:40,030
in order to get the data from it so you

392
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,620
know just like ICS you know your

393
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,300
industrial control systems they have

394
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,770
stuff that's been around forever once

395
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,900
you implement you don't touch it you

396
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,850
leave it alone that's the same thing

397
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,590
with some of our devices so we can't

398
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,090
often touch it we can't upgrade we can't

399
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,460
update but we can find a way to extract

400
00:14:52,090 --> 00:15:01,270
that data and get it to where we need it

401
00:14:54,460 --> 00:15:04,290
and then what happens but there we go

402
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,290
yes sir

403
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:32,540
sure yeah they implement protocols

404
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,580
whether it be through VPN or some other

405
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:38,689
encryption protocols they do implement

406
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:41,090
those types of things but not as well as

407
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,040
what your ring furring - so but yeah we

408
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,230
use a lot of likes a middleware physical

409
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,699
they look like small switches and their

410
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,920
sole purpose is to connect again a bunch

411
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,630
of devices and then translate the

412
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,339
information so they actually do the

413
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,980
extraction of the data and then put it

414
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:59,450
in hl7 format and then get it to a

415
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:01,040
gateway but then as a technician like

416
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,050
myself we often find ourselves in this

417
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,550
kind of a mess I don't know how many of

418
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,890
you have experience in data closets this

419
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,140
is not uncommon so we're trying to

420
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,150
interconnect our devices like I stated

421
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,770
we have thousands of devices now in the

422
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,449
network we end up in a spaghetti string

423
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,370
mess like this trying to get those

424
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,530
devices to communicate which also poses

425
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,930
another security risk for one we have no

426
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:22,430
idea where anything is going nothing's

427
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,719
labeled nothing's identified we're just

428
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,569
plugging and chugging and trying to keep

429
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,050
our hospital running keep our clinicians

430
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,050
happy

431
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:41,560
all right here keyboard maybe okay so

432
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,890
the other thing that we're finding that

433
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,599
the other stuff we have is RF if we

434
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:48,910
aren't or any type of wireless signal

435
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,140
for that matter if we're not connecting

436
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:55,959
it through some piece of middleware if

437
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:57,939
we're not doing it with Ethernet or the

438
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,640
network jack we're doing it wirelessly

439
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,830
whether it be bluetooth 802 dot eleven

440
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,420
ZigBee whatever it may be so you'd see

441
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,400
in this room this is not unreal

442
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:09,100
they're numerous numerous if not more

443
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,069
than this devices that are producing or

444
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:15,129
emanating RF signal some of these

445
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:17,500
signals are very easily we can we can

446
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,150
crack them in a matter of minutes okay

447
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,189
we can capture these signals all day

448
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,100
long we can extract patient data from

449
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:26,620
these signals and some of these devices

450
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:28,208
and they become very easily hackable but

451
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:31,060
I just as you can see this is a standard

452
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:31,930
er room so if you were to become injured

453
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,389
and they dragged you into the hospital

454
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:37,030
this is what a standard today's standard

455
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,290
emergency room looks like but we have

456
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,149
everything from patient monitors to even

457
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,870
our clock or wall clock is now wireless

458
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,010
and we've got wireless sensors on our

459
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,899
lights our surgical lights that you may

460
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,610
see I'm due to temperature things like

461
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,520
that our defibrillators are in the room

462
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:56,949
and their stuff shoved in our medicine

463
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,570
cabinets that is also wireless so what

464
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,560
are the wit risks excuse me what do you

465
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,030
think about when you go to a hospital

466
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,679
what do you go to you know what are

467
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,810
these things that come to your mind when

468
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,820
you're step foot to your health and your

469
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,139
healthcare providers office you don't

470
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,450
think about cyber security you don't

471
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,740
think about the medical devices you you

472
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,970
think about yourself you think about a

473
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,470
loved one you think about why you're

474
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:16,660
there you know you want relief whatever

475
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,970
it may be that's your purpose that's

476
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,620
your your reason being there you don't

477
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,970
ever think about what could happen you

478
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,409
don't think about other than maybe a

479
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,780
missed appointment something like that

480
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:28,780
the risks that that that are occurring

481
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:32,649
right now in healthcare so some of these

482
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:34,810
risks are insanely vulnerable they're

483
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,070
easy they're happening left and right

484
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:38,169
we're finding them in our newspapers

485
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:40,450
every day the headline here is it's

486
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:42,370
insanely easy to hack Hospital equipment

487
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,590
medical researchers were thrown into a

488
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,658
hospital there they were given free

489
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:49,149
range and they found that they could

490
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:51,070
drug delivery dosage they could change

491
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:53,439
all this and infusion pumps remotely

492
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:56,349
they could change settings on

493
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,539
defibrillators to get the defibrillator

494
00:18:56,349 --> 00:19:00,369
to either fire or not fire at a

495
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:02,169
particular time when it's requested they

496
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:04,869
could deny the service or again they

497
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:08,200
could implement it to make it discharge

498
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:11,408
while not intended to refrigerators

499
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,179
freezers we store we sort bones we store

500
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:14,889
organs we store blood we store this

501
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:17,979
stuff in these pieces of equipment that

502
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:20,859
can be turned off remotely again we have

503
00:19:17,979 --> 00:19:23,649
pumps that are utilized for your care

504
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:27,668
delivery that if we can manipulate the

505
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:29,139
dosage we could kill you and the other

506
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:31,239
is the implantable medical devices can

507
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:33,459
be hacked to harm patients just as I

508
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:35,200
stated before it's been proven numerous

509
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,359
times that individuals can hack their

510
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,489
own you know there are researchers who

511
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,749
are they've already debunked this

512
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:44,609
they've already found it's true they've

513
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:44,609
moved to hunt to the next thing you know

514
00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:52,659
this is an interesting slide you're all

515
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:54,340
familiar with showed in and what medical

516
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:55,960
researchers found was within a matter of

517
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,970
four to five minutes they found about

518
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,419
thirty six thousand different medical

519
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,830
devices communicating on on show down or

520
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:04,479
found through showed in in a matter of

521
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,789
four to five minutes thirty six thousand

522
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:08,590
medical devices they could specify all

523
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:10,210
the way down from the state the city to

524
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,939
the facility and I know at some point

525
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,169
time you've all used this website yeah I

526
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,669
believe you get a free account with an

527
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:19,989
edu email address or premium account so

528
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:23,169
that's a scary thing that our medical

529
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:24,999
devices are out there communicating on

530
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:28,019
the net they're communicating in the

531
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:32,190
world wide web in ways that are easily

532
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:32,190
attracting attackers and hackers

533
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:41,640
here's another one where security

534
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:44,070
researchers found a back door on an MRI

535
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,440
scanner so the big round donut with the

536
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,760
table is magnetic resonance imaging

537
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,760
scanner it's about a two million dollar

538
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,799
device it's so expensive most hospitals

539
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,690
only have one of these if they can

540
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,910
afford more they'll have more but it's a

541
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,710
critical asset to the organization in

542
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,790
fact some organizations would probably

543
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,340
shut their doors if they don't have

544
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,170
access to some of these types of devices

545
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,699
so 2 million-dollar device where medical

546
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,470
researchers found our security

547
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,860
researchers found that they were

548
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,100
exfiltrating patient data for months

549
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,629
unnoticed

550
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,969
no one ever noticed no one had any idea

551
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:17,370
so they had a back door just

552
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:21,270
deliberately taking data and these

553
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:25,020
devices produce gigs of data per per

554
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:26,910
patient per day and then the other

555
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,460
statement next to it is no one is

556
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:32,610
thinking about a CT scanner or an MRI

557
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,820
machine as a broader launch pad or as a

558
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:37,409
launch pad for a broader attack

559
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,299
absolutely I am that's that's one of my

560
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,919
biggest concerns is knowing that there's

561
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:43,230
only a few of these devices in each

562
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,120
organization or each a health care

563
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,950
delivery organization they're very

564
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,928
easily it's public knowledge on what

565
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,950
they have what make what model we know

566
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:52,080
what's available

567
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,720
we know these devices go unpatched

568
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,059
untouched vulnerable for many many many

569
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,650
many years and most hospitals don't just

570
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:00,090
replace these every two years I mean

571
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,980
again at a million to two million

572
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,799
dollars we may try to keep these for at

573
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:07,980
least ten years as a time of material

574
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,470
customer we don't pay for contracts we

575
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,630
don't pay for free upgrades we don't pay

576
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,220
for software our device is working we

577
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,230
keep it working we keep it the way it is

578
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,880
and I'm my responsibility is to manage

579
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,160
that device so I keep that with a heist

580
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,210
working but if we don't have upgrades we

581
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,090
don't have these things because they're

582
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:27,210
just too costly you know 40 50 60 to

583
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:31,020
$100,000 to update the system isn't

584
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:32,669
really practical so these devices are

585
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,889
extremely vulnerable there most of these

586
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:36,510
devices are sitting on XP they've never

587
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:39,240
been patched they've never been touched

588
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:41,549
since 2013 14 15 whatever and they'll

589
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,530
stay that way for years so having these

590
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:45,510
devices known with these vulnerabilities

591
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,370
we know that my facility might have

592
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,050
three of the exact same you know that I

593
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,770
you down the street might have three

594
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,350
that are the exact

595
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,629
same the ability to utilize an advanced

596
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,129
persistent threat and use these machines

597
00:22:54,630 --> 00:23:09,600
and then maybe shut them all off at the

598
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:11,670
same time you know yes sir we request it

599
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,040
there's nothing mandatory at this time

600
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:15,630
there's really the device manufacturers

601
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,010
have a hard time thinking they have

602
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,770
vulnerabilities they have a hard time

603
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:21,210
thinking that it's their problem

604
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:23,370
oftentimes it's seen as well the device

605
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:25,530
has been sold it's in your organization

606
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,360
it's your responsibility to protect and

607
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:29,970
maintain theirs there's too much money

608
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,199
involved for the whole process so the

609
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:35,220
FDA and the government has asked that

610
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,560
manufacturers start implementing

611
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,810
controls and as a health care delivery

612
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:42,000
organization we ask the provider who's

613
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:44,399
going to sell us a product do you have

614
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,290
these controls in place otherwise we're

615
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,410
not going to purchase your product so

616
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:51,899
yes sir so what about containment right

617
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:57,270
instead of patching you can contain and

618
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:59,310
that's partly somewhat because our users

619
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,080
still make this device vulnerable our

620
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:03,120
users are still notorious for plugging

621
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,550
in flash drives they're still notorious

622
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,199
for charging their tablets they they

623
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,760
come with basic computers they sit right

624
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,070
there in front of the user and the user

625
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,330
is gonna charge their phone I've caught

626
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,250
it I've seen it it's happened numerous

627
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,110
times so yes and I'll talk about

628
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,390
containment strategies at the very end

629
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:20,729
so yes and that's an approach we're

630
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,990
looking at as as healthcare delivery

631
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,450
organizations because we don't have the

632
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,150
support from our manufacturers and we

633
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:29,100
don't have anti-malware antivirus anti

634
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,720
anything specific to these devices

635
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,520
because sometimes as a delivery

636
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,770
organization I don't even have access to

637
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,540
the operating system if I go to install

638
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,350
something third-party I avoid anything

639
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,970
I've void warranty

640
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,760
they can't promise me how the system is

641
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:43,320
going to behave now I've taken devices

642
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,510
out of service and poked and prodded and

643
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,840
tested but if I go back to the

644
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:50,580
manufacturer and say hey I think it's ok

645
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,949
they need to validate that not myself so

646
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,120
they're not gonna trust my results but

647
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,680
that's what we're in the process of

648
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,750
doing I've been taking devices offline

649
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,210
and scanning and scanning and stalling

650
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:01,650
and and and evaluating to see what what

651
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,330
kind of changes are made what what's

652
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,700
happening

653
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:08,269
but yes I will get to some of our

654
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:10,789
control measures oh here's another one

655
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:11,960
massive ransom cyber attack hits nearly

656
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:13,820
a hundred countries around the world

657
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,429
you're all familiar with wanna cry and

658
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,809
as sad as it is as a health care

659
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:19,250
delivery organization that was our

660
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:21,850
wake-up call that was our holy crap

661
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:24,230
moment because we didn't know what to do

662
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,879
we weren't affected my organization

663
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:28,220
wasn't but the organization's next door

664
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,220
were and you're getting phone calls and

665
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,960
hey did this occur to you guys hey what

666
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,789
are you guys doing hey we're getting

667
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,799
those calls more frequently now you know

668
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:39,500
we're sharing information on what's

669
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:42,769
happening and it's more predominant than

670
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:45,769
ever so again this is exactly a thousand

671
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:48,380
hospital or excuse me 16 hospitals were

672
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:49,490
shut down in the UK shut down so if you

673
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,260
think about this from a cyber

674
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,210
perspective if this hit all the

675
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,850
hospitals in this area if this hit all

676
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:58,039
the hospitals in Indianapolis you could

677
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:59,658
totally deny service and care for anyone

678
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:01,639
you're you're in a trauma you have a

679
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:04,370
heart attack something's going on you're

680
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:08,000
sick or injured we have to turn you away

681
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:12,049
you know again as as a cyber attack this

682
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,799
this is a huge problem now a lot of our

683
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:17,059
IT systems are protected they're updated

684
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,110
they're patched we have intrusion

685
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:20,120
detection systems we have the

686
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,580
anti-malware we have ways to circumvent

687
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,889
that but I just stated our medical

688
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:28,010
devices don't so as long as it gets in

689
00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:31,219
it can find its way around very very

690
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:34,100
easily protocols ports are open things

691
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,929
like that and the best and fastest and

692
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,090
easiest way it gets in is by a user and

693
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:40,159
we'll talk about phishing I mean you all

694
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,809
know how phishing works but I I'll show

695
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,830
you how easy it is and it happens all

696
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:48,320
the time in healthcare all the time this

697
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:51,019
happened just January 17th it actually

698
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,460
happened in December of 2016 but Hancock

699
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:53,659
Regional Health paid a ransom where

700
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,669
fifty five thousand dollars two

701
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:57,380
attackers they didn't they didn't get a

702
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:58,990
medical device but they got some some

703
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,429
computers some databases that had

704
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,690
patient information on it so they paid

705
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:04,460
the fifty five thousand dollar ransom

706
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:09,380
you're finding this in the newspaper

707
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:10,760
every single week as you'd see if you if

708
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:14,389
you ever want to see your data back

709
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,980
you're gonna pay this price and it's

710
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:18,590
very scary

711
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,539
and again closed due to malware we

712
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:22,610
absolutely will close our doors I have

713
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:25,010
three CT scanners if those three CT

714
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:27,229
scanners go down we cannot serve as

715
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,879
patients we're a level 1 trauma center

716
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,380
we'll have to divert any patients that

717
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,610
come in make them go to another facility

718
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:36,049
and Duke it out one way or another we

719
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,000
have we don't have implementations in

720
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:39,860
process yet now we are working with the

721
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,120
local government we're working with our

722
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,850
other healthcare organizations to

723
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,209
develop an action plan so we're working

724
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:49,189
with mesh in Indianapolis to find a way

725
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:53,480
what is the approach if this happens

726
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:55,880
what are we to do now what some

727
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,470
researchers say is 1 million

728
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,789
vulnerability so I'm going back to

729
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:02,299
medical devices I'm talking about a

730
00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:03,860
physical medical device now and what a

731
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:05,090
lot of these researchers have done when

732
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,678
they've spent hours and hours and hours

733
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,928
researching the vulnerabilities on these

734
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,340
devices is yes they have found one

735
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:13,309
million they found hundreds of

736
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,980
vulnerabilities on one device but which

737
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:17,840
ones affect patient care which one is

738
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,190
that potential to kill a patient which

739
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,549
ones the one that's going to cause an

740
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:25,120
adverse reaction we don't know we could

741
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:27,830
talk about mitre scores and and see

742
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,928
common vulnerability scores and all that

743
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:32,510
fun stuff all day long we can calculate

744
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:35,059
risk all we want the likelihood is

745
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:36,230
always going to be there it's we can't

746
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:38,590
determine the likelihood because it's

747
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:41,029
guaranteed but we can't determine

748
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:43,279
exactly which vulnerabilities are gonna

749
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:45,919
hurt a patient so again if we have

750
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:50,360
numerous we have hundreds which ones

751
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:53,299
which ones so the focus on penetration

752
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:55,699
testing medical devices has shifted ok

753
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:57,320
again ok yes like I say we can find that

754
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,210
there's maybe thousands on this device

755
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:03,230
but again which ones are most

756
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:05,630
significant and then what some

757
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:08,019
manufacturers say there's nothing here

758
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:11,269
to see move along they don't want to

759
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:13,010
don't want to necessarily publicize that

760
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:14,029
maybe there's a vulnerability because

761
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:16,010
again we don't know which

762
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:19,130
vulnerabilities are going to have enough

763
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:21,320
impact also the way that the equipment

764
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:24,080
was designed is often different than as

765
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,120
implemented it was designed to work in

766
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,649
this setting but us as healthcare

767
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,500
delivery organizations have implemented

768
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:30,540
it in a differ

769
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,760
way so when we implement it in a

770
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,700
different way we often create more

771
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,410
vulnerabilities so again it costs more

772
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,490
time research money and effort for a

773
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:43,080
manufacturer to to fess up to do their

774
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,430
own now there are many that do

775
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,949
participate I've gone to a few

776
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:48,900
conferences where they're very open hey

777
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,490
help us we want to know they've asked me

778
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,560
they asked several of us from delivery

779
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:54,570
organizations what do we need to do

780
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,220
other than basic secure coding practices

781
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,780
you know textbook stuff that we're all

782
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,000
familiar with you know they want to know

783
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:03,780
what they can do we need more hard coded

784
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,070
security pieces in place you know

785
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:07,800
written into the software we want

786
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:09,600
encryption we want mutual or a

787
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,700
multi-factor authentication we want

788
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,090
maybe biometrics we want things that

789
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:18,770
that can help so again there are many

790
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:18,770
that are participating some are not

791
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:24,870
with some black hats say again

792
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:27,419
vulnerabilities Wiis on it ok there

793
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,439
again there they'll find them they're

794
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,540
going to look for them they're going to

795
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,460
continuously analyze and look for those

796
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,379
vulnerabilities hospitals are very very

797
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,490
easy if you think about it again you

798
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,050
walk into a hospital we're an

799
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,780
organization where we care we want to

800
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:42,360
know what can we do for you but we can't

801
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,430
monitor everyone and everything so if

802
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,260
you come up to a kiosk and you're gonna

803
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,670
play around in a kiosk and you're going

804
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,170
to inject you're going to insert malware

805
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,280
you're going to do your SQL injection or

806
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:52,620
you're gonna do your cross-site script

807
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,810
whatever you want to do who's going to

808
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,070
question you if you want to sit there

809
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,600
and bring in your laptop and start

810
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:00,060
cracking our wireless passwords who's

811
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,340
gonna stop you nobody we might have you

812
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:07,040
on camera but 200 days later is by the

813
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:09,689
time we figure it out it's pretty easy

814
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:14,030
and what the problem really is there's

815
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:16,490
numerous problems again what with the

816
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:19,110
with the medical device manufacturers

817
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:20,970
participating their way and a healthcare

818
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:24,209
delivery organizations looking for a

819
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:26,610
different approach it's hard we don't

820
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:28,380
have a direct answer the problem is this

821
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:30,990
medical devices now aren't just a

822
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:33,960
physical device that produce therapy or

823
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:36,360
an infusion or diagnostic we have now

824
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,910
implemented devices that may look like

825
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,310
this a physician or surgeon may plug

826
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:42,330
something into his iPhone what

827
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,908
constitutes a medical

828
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:46,439
device anymore when we take a scope we

829
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:48,419
take an endoscope or we take something

830
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,700
and the physician now wants to plug it

831
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:53,250
in to his iPhone and view the images or

832
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,049
the recording on his phone which part of

833
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,580
that is the Medical Device now so

834
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:59,250
there's a lot of skewness here we don't

835
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:02,370
understand necessarily anymore the the

836
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:06,779
the gaps you know are getting bigger as

837
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:09,479
we again look more at mobile health so

838
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:11,010
again when the definition of a medical

839
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,230
device is it's an instrument or an

840
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:16,649
apparatus a machine implant or in vitro

841
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:19,350
reagent or other similar or related

842
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:21,539
article including a component part an

843
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:24,120
accessory intended for the use and

844
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:26,669
diagnosis of disease or other conditions

845
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,889
or in the Cure mitigation treatment or

846
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:31,649
prevention of disease it's pretty broad

847
00:32:28,889 --> 00:32:33,689
it's really broad so wherein there is

848
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:35,760
software where and there is the iPhone

849
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:38,940
where in there is that information it's

850
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,250
not so again that being a medical device

851
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,220
sometimes the information technology

852
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,779
department the IT security department

853
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,429
they don't touch these devices that

854
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:49,799
communicate so when the doctor plugs in

855
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:51,630
his scope into his iPhone they don't

856
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:53,250
have anything to do with it that's on

857
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,559
someone like me that's our healthcare

858
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,299
technology engineers are our clinical

859
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:59,340
engineers we often call them inside the

860
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:00,990
hospital to maintain those devices we

861
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,209
may not even know what he has we may not

862
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:04,460
know what's available to us and I'll

863
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:06,809
cover that in a moment

864
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:09,960
so the threat landscape here with

865
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:12,240
medical devices is rather significant so

866
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,190
US healthcare delivery organizations

867
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,320
have been victims of one cyberattack per

868
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:19,110
month over the past 12 months on average

869
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,059
all of them half them have experienced

870
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:23,639
some loss or exposure to protected

871
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:25,500
health information and the most common

872
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:27,529
security incident is the exploitation of

873
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,179
existing software vulnerabilities

874
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:32,789
now patching not updating not even

875
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:39,059
understanding what what your assets are

876
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:43,019
exactly all your inventory so about 43%

877
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:45,029
of proportion or soon about 43% of

878
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,600
breaches are due to insiders our own

879
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:49,169
people

880
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,469
so yes 27% is from hacking it's from

881
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:54,029
individuals wanting to steal that data

882
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:56,100
19% are from lost or theft a lot of

883
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:57,929
people steal laptops clinicians take

884
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,850
laptops home all day long I take a

885
00:33:57,929 --> 00:34:01,230
laptop home we have security practices

886
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:03,570
in place but as you guys already know

887
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:06,150
it's pretty easy to crack those but our

888
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:08,759
insiders through phishing scams is the

889
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:10,740
biggest you know click here and you know

890
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,190
resubmit or your your credentials have

891
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:16,350
been lost you know or stolen please

892
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:19,230
reenter your credentials all day every

893
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:22,139
day we get these emails and so

894
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:23,399
clinicians are often very giving of this

895
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:25,139
information they're busy

896
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:26,850
one nurse might take care of six

897
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:28,409
patients at a time so when she's

898
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:30,418
obligated to check her emails and she

899
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:33,090
gets an email and it indicates hey this

900
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:35,908
is IT staff we need you to reinitialize

901
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:39,030
or reinsert your password or whatever

902
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:40,619
maybe sometimes they are noted notorious

903
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,359
for doing that not saying just

904
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:45,869
clinicians we all are because we lack

905
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:48,179
awareness now we we are on the brink of

906
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:49,889
of teaching it we're implementing

907
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:51,840
methods of teaching it but again as we

908
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:53,730
just discussed clinicians care about

909
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,379
their patients they don't care about

910
00:34:53,730 --> 00:35:00,060
what's on that computer screen unless it

911
00:34:55,379 --> 00:35:03,480
involves their patients so is hacking or

912
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:06,509
healthcare hacking an epidemic so one of

913
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,280
the most notable here is anthem in 2015

914
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:10,619
was hit with seventy eight point eight

915
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,660
million customers being hacked I was one

916
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:14,340
of them the best they could do for me is

917
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,049
give me LifeLock for what two years I

918
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:18,150
think it was that's the best they could

919
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:19,680
do for me I don't know where my data is

920
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:22,470
I haven't seen it nothing's come about

921
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,230
from it yet so we'll get to that though

922
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,430
sans reports ninety-four percent of

923
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:28,920
health care organizations have been the

924
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:32,190
victim of a cyber attack some of them

925
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:34,080
don't even know it the healthcare sector

926
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:37,530
ranked second in US data breaches in

927
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:41,940
2015 and secured a spot on Verizon's

928
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:43,920
global hacking report and about 47% of

929
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,390
the u.s. population have had their

930
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,800
personal health care data compromised

931
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:51,890
over the last 12 months

932
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,380
50 percent of that forty seven percent

933
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:59,700
had an average of $2,500 out-of-pocket

934
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:03,540
expenses how does that happen someone

935
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:05,129
steals your identity and they assume it

936
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,770
as their own and then they get medical

937
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:10,200
procedures done under your name under

938
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:12,630
your information and you get stuck with

939
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,980
bill this isn't the FDIC you're not it's

940
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,150
not a credit card it's not a social

941
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,290
security number where you're you're

942
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,000
federally insured and you'll get your

943
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,560
money back you have to pay that

944
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,480
someone's paying that and it's you

945
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,779
because it's in your name it's in yours

946
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,820
there's numerous stories back in 2011

947
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,440
some Chinese hackers took about two

948
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,630
thousand x-rays from a medical facility

949
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,890
and they did it so they could pass their

950
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,380
medical exams so they could get their

951
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:37,828
travel visas so it's not just about

952
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:39,570
money it's it's about everything if we

953
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:41,099
want to like I say whether it be a

954
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:42,540
denial service attack whether we want

955
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:44,970
our travel visa or they want their

956
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,290
travel visas or they need their medical

957
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,890
procedures done and they don't want to

958
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,570
pay for it

959
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,460
we'll find a way to make someone else

960
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:54,050
pay for it you know how expensive

961
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:57,900
medical procedures are yeah they're not

962
00:36:54,050 --> 00:37:02,099
it's a mortgage it's a house it's not

963
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:04,430
cheap so for the X amount of years

964
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:07,020
lately it's been the wrong mission

965
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:09,000
outdated approach and it's been failure

966
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,650
we've been focusing on patient records

967
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,810
I've been talking about pH I I've been

968
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:14,790
talking about EHRs so protected health

969
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:17,400
information and electronic health

970
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:18,750
records electronic health records and

971
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,030
I'll say this repeatedly I have another

972
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,890
slide on it are very valuable if you

973
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:25,500
think about it what is on your

974
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:27,509
electronic health record not the one you

975
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,490
might log into on your mobile mobile app

976
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:32,910
but the one that's actually stored at

977
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:35,129
the hospital everything about you every

978
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:37,109
disease you might have ever had every

979
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:40,470
person related to you every job you

980
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:43,078
might have had every last ten places you

981
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:46,919
might have lived so we have everything

982
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:48,480
that we need to know about you so again

983
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,950
we've we've been focusing on patient

984
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,079
records and that's not really the case

985
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:55,230
anymore we've been ignoring some of the

986
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,450
advanced threats maybe boil back to that

987
00:37:55,230 --> 00:38:00,030
CT scanner and launching a broader

988
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:02,910
attack a globalized denial of service in

989
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:07,619
healthcare and patients just simply

990
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:10,230
aren't protected so there's a no problem

991
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,730
who owns cybersecurity and healthcare so

992
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,190
cybersecurity leadership leadership

993
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:17,609
structure differs across the globe in

994
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:20,910
health care only about 67% of healthcare

995
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:23,220
organizations have a SISO 32% don't and

996
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:25,460
whoever took the survey 1% just have no

997
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,459
idea

998
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:36,570
and budgets 65% of dedicate only

999
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:42,150
dedicate 6% or less of their IT budget

1000
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:43,380
to security ISO minimal when it comes to

1001
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:46,560
millions of dollars in budget go to

1002
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,840
security that's changing the problem is

1003
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,160
what's the return on investment we know

1004
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,410
what the server costs we know the

1005
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,420
expected life expected life expectancy

1006
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:55,529
we can calculate it all day long how

1007
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,720
about some of these security measures

1008
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:59,690
how can we calculate what they're going

1009
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,430
to stop how can we calculate that this

1010
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:04,200
$60,000 device or this enterprise

1011
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:06,810
solution is going to stop ransomware

1012
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,450
that might cost us who knows what we

1013
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:12,029
don't know we can't calculate that so a

1014
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:14,399
lot of c-suite members are very

1015
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:17,190
reluctant to distribute funds to

1016
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,170
security yet as we start to see this

1017
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,700
ransomware in the newspaper every week

1018
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,560
you're going to start to see them come

1019
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,230
up off that a little bit actually our

1020
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,150
organization is asking hey what can we

1021
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,620
do what do we need we're getting more

1022
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,780
and more funds each year to start

1023
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,700
analyzing looking and applying new

1024
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:38,430
controls and compensating controls for

1025
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:41,580
this but this is this is crazy so why is

1026
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:43,140
health care getting hacked why lack of

1027
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,750
aid we don't have funding we don't have

1028
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,359
money we don't have resources so as a

1029
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:50,460
health care delivery organization people

1030
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,920
in my department lack some basic

1031
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:55,680
information security knowledge and

1032
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,420
skills we do so the individuals who take

1033
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,770
care of the equipment may not have

1034
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,870
enough underlain a fundamental

1035
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:02,850
understanding of some of this stuff

1036
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:04,560
we're understaffed our focus is on

1037
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:06,480
maintaining the devices we want to

1038
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,400
ensure it's safe for the patients we

1039
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,020
have to perform preventative maintenance

1040
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,960
on these devices we don't necessarily

1041
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:16,590
have the time to ensure it's safe in the

1042
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,360
cyber world again undertrained there's

1043
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,950
not a lot of information pertaining to

1044
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,110
medical devices what do we do with cyber

1045
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,640
security medical devices you know sure

1046
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:25,350
we could take a class in cyber security

1047
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,540
but that pertains to information systems

1048
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:28,920
yes we have an information system within

1049
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:31,830
a medical device but we also have the

1050
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,260
medical device itself ease of network

1051
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:36,839
intrusion we've kind of discussed this

1052
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,849
rather than outside coming in

1053
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,650
excuse me external penetration coming in

1054
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:42,690
you can just step foot in the hospital

1055
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:47,849
you can get your hands on stuff you know

1056
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:49,349
if you want to go walk into a suite and

1057
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:52,229
even an O R if you want it to an

1058
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:53,729
operating room you could do so okay

1059
00:40:52,229 --> 00:40:56,069
there are mechanisms in place to prevent

1060
00:40:53,729 --> 00:40:57,390
you but it's relatively easy you know

1061
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:59,400
you've learned all about reconnaissance

1062
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,598
through hacking and whatnot and what

1063
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,400
individuals will do to get

1064
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:03,599
dumpster-diving all this information you

1065
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,019
can do the same thing at the healthcare

1066
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,029
facility the information is just too

1067
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:10,229
good we've talked about pH I we've

1068
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:12,359
talked about the information in your

1069
00:41:10,229 --> 00:41:12,930
electronic health record it's too good

1070
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:17,430
to pass up

1071
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:19,379
it's sweet we we have so much of it and

1072
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:22,229
we don't know how to handle it so you

1073
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:24,719
can come and get some hackers competence

1074
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:26,968
competence or healthcare delivery

1075
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:29,279
organizations technological incompetence

1076
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:31,499
it's a mixture of both because I can

1077
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:33,960
tell you we can stop the typical script

1078
00:41:31,499 --> 00:41:36,569
kiddies an individual who who lacks any

1079
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,349
true competence yeah we can prevent them

1080
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:39,779
from getting in

1081
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:43,469
it's the hacktivists and and some of the

1082
00:41:39,779 --> 00:41:45,450
nation-state people that and

1083
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:46,739
organizations that are what's

1084
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:48,299
troublesome the ones that are familiar

1085
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:49,880
with advanced persistent threats and

1086
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:52,799
encoding and things like that

1087
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,089
but again we don't have necessarily the

1088
00:41:52,799 --> 00:41:55,529
tools and resources in place

1089
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:57,719
you know our security teams are small

1090
00:41:55,529 --> 00:41:59,670
some of its outsourced a lot of workers

1091
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:03,660
and some organizations are just buying a

1092
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:05,099
cybersecurity insurance you know forget

1093
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:07,399
it we'll just take the risk we'll just

1094
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:07,400
buy insurance

1095
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:12,630
so here's more on the threat landscape

1096
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:16,619
UCLA claims they block millions of known

1097
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:18,989
hacker attempts each year 171 million

1098
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:21,829
patient records were exposed since 2009

1099
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:25,529
I believe that number is much higher now

1100
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:28,609
but an increase in 137 percent and pH I

1101
00:42:25,529 --> 00:42:32,339
breached from 2012 to 2013 alone

1102
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:34,999
consistently increasing one in 204

1103
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:37,558
emails contained malware to clinicians

1104
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:41,609
so some sort of malware to a clinician

1105
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:45,930
one in 204 it takes us on average about

1106
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:48,359
200 days to discover a breach denial

1107
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:50,609
service attacks cost about 1.3 to

1108
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:53,788
million dollars per organization in the

1109
00:42:50,609 --> 00:43:00,150
12 months and about a thousand

1110
00:42:53,789 --> 00:43:02,190
ransomware attacks per day so our assets

1111
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:03,989
our health records that's our biggest

1112
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:06,150
asset and our and our patients obviously

1113
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:07,980
our patients health our records our

1114
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,989
service availability our ability to

1115
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,690
maintain service and give you service

1116
00:43:09,989 --> 00:43:15,299
and provide you service our community

1117
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:17,279
confidence and trust if we're constantly

1118
00:43:15,299 --> 00:43:19,380
hacked if we're constantly shutting our

1119
00:43:17,279 --> 00:43:21,720
doors are you going to come for your

1120
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,009
procedure to our facility absolutely not

1121
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,749
you're gonna go next door you'll go

1122
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:26,400
somewhere else

1123
00:43:24,749 --> 00:43:27,930
intellectual property we may have

1124
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,170
information that's proprietary or

1125
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:32,940
specific to us that keeps us business a

1126
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:35,249
competitive advantage again boils with

1127
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,749
business advantage finances and

1128
00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:38,788
reputation these are our assets

1129
00:43:36,749 --> 00:43:43,859
physician reputation health care

1130
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:47,249
reputation organizational reputation so

1131
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:49,440
who is hacking health care numerous now

1132
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:50,910
I talked about script kiddies they're at

1133
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,799
this point kind of worthless they don't

1134
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:54,328
they can't do much damage we're pretty

1135
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:55,920
well protected against them unless they

1136
00:43:54,329 --> 00:43:59,400
get inside and they use some basic tools

1137
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,630
but our hacktivists groups which are

1138
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,569
more tutorial well I'll cover that in a

1139
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:07,279
minute but our cyber criminals our cyber

1140
00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:07,279
terrorists and our nation-state actors

1141
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:13,259
so if we look at our topology of threats

1142
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:17,009
here we have an adversary who may be a

1143
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:20,069
hacktivist and he's here on the left and

1144
00:44:17,009 --> 00:44:21,839
he's kind of looking around he's doing

1145
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:23,640
his recon he's looking at something

1146
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,279
untargeted meaning he's just choosing a

1147
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,859
hospital with the biggest reward and the

1148
00:44:26,279 --> 00:44:32,400
lowest risk so he might look for

1149
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:34,650
something like my facility compared to

1150
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,720
the facility next door which is a

1151
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:38,670
Children's Hospital because maybe a

1152
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,919
children's medical record isn't as good

1153
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:42,480
as someone in my facility or maybe we

1154
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,799
have a private facility next door where

1155
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,690
we know everyone's paying big dollars

1156
00:44:43,799 --> 00:44:49,019
for procedures over there cosmetic

1157
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:52,799
procedures that might be better that I

1158
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:54,629
also be less risk so these types of

1159
00:44:52,799 --> 00:44:56,970
adversaries aren't looking for anyone in

1160
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:58,980
specific they're just looking for the

1161
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:00,419
gold nugget they just want the whole

1162
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,650
thing so they're gonna try and get as

1163
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,440
many records as they can with weak

1164
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:06,990
security where someone an adversary

1165
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,180
who is targeting someone again might be

1166
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:11,368
an activist or hacktivist it might be a

1167
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:13,140
nation-state group they're looking maybe

1168
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:15,569
for political targets maybe people of

1169
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,520
famous blackmail things like that that

1170
00:45:15,569 --> 00:45:19,170
happens all the time I hear all the time

1171
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,329
about health care workers on accident or

1172
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:23,369
on purpose looking at records they

1173
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:25,260
shouldn't be looking at but these

1174
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:27,050
organizations do the same they might

1175
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:33,240
look for someone who's of value and

1176
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:36,690
blackmail so again the adversaries

1177
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,848
profiles so this kind of depicts two

1178
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:41,190
different things there's patient records

1179
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:42,839
and then there's patient health so if

1180
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:45,060
you look at the adversary of individual

1181
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:47,640
or small group your script kitty they

1182
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:48,990
don't care about harming a patient there

1183
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,250
don't they lack the skills and the

1184
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:53,160
technical ability and maybe even the

1185
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:56,099
time but they do care about patient

1186
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,598
records they're gonna untargeted Nate

1187
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:59,670
and get whatever they can and get out

1188
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,530
then you have your political groups and

1189
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,630
you're hacktivists which are going to

1190
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:05,250
look for targeted victims and they're

1191
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:07,260
gonna look at patient records again they

1192
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:09,410
might not care about that individual's

1193
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:12,869
health they just care about their record

1194
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:15,270
then we have our organized crime who yes

1195
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:17,490
they might target someone and yes maybe

1196
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:19,800
they are looking to cause harm to that

1197
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:21,598
individual same thing with if they want

1198
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,099
their records and obviously our

1199
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,690
terrorism and our nation-states are

1200
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:26,579
across the board really looking at

1201
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:30,859
individuals they're looking at hurting

1202
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:30,859
and harming people and obtaining records

1203
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,780
so this came from independent security

1204
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:39,359
evaluators it's a nice graph and it

1205
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:41,640
might be a little blurry for you but

1206
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,920
it's a patient health attack model and

1207
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,540
what is really boiled down to is is you

1208
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,089
have your patient in the very center and

1209
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:50,700
you have your exterior you know where

1210
00:46:48,089 --> 00:46:53,009
some information can be extracted or

1211
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,500
penetrated and attackers are basically

1212
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:57,960
trying to penetrate into the center

1213
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:00,720
where the patient is so the outside

1214
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,880
might be where your pH I and your PII is

1215
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,439
in my whole sense of information non

1216
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,990
sensitive information and your records

1217
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,920
things like that but the inner circle

1218
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:12,328
there with the physician the surgery the

1219
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,950
active medical devices in medicine is

1220
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:17,520
going to be targeted towards an

1221
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:18,390
individual attackers may look to try to

1222
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,730
harm a patient

1223
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:21,950
by modifying again drug delivery dosage

1224
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:24,450
maybe they're gonna try and change

1225
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:26,399
surgery schedules you ever think of a

1226
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:28,799
hacker going in and changing your

1227
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,539
procedure you know we've heard of wrong

1228
00:47:28,799 --> 00:47:31,859
site surgery before you know maybe

1229
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:33,510
someone made a mistake

1230
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:35,069
well how about they actually go in they

1231
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:36,539
change that that you're supposed to get

1232
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:37,859
your left leg amputated and you end up

1233
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:38,819
getting your right or something else

1234
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:41,038
done

1235
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:42,359
yeah that's feasible that's possible

1236
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:44,309
okay

1237
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:46,200
same thing with stopping the physician

1238
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:48,000
maybe they'll they know the physician

1239
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,038
may be the physicians high-profile and

1240
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,079
they'd like to do something to that

1241
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:58,289
physician to prevent them to offer the

1242
00:47:52,079 --> 00:48:02,400
service to you why why do they do it why

1243
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:05,130
do we care why do you care because for

1244
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,839
one it costs you money whether you ever

1245
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:08,760
step foot in healthcare facility whether

1246
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:09,779
you care about being a program or

1247
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,700
whether you care about working for a

1248
00:48:09,779 --> 00:48:14,130
medical device manufacturer or working

1249
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,990
for a hospital at some way shape or form

1250
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:18,180
when it comes to Public Health and it

1251
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:21,959
comes to hacking and what's going on you

1252
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:24,598
might be paying for it so right now it's

1253
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,960
estimated that social security numbers

1254
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:29,430
are about $15 on the dark web

1255
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,869
credit cards are almost worth nothing

1256
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:33,029
you know one two three dollars and as

1257
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:34,859
time goes on that will disappear but

1258
00:48:33,029 --> 00:48:37,890
your medical record is worth anywhere

1259
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:40,109
from 100 to 500 dollars it just depends

1260
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:42,629
and if you think about it one medical

1261
00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:45,569
record is fairly easy to get I can get a

1262
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:47,099
whole stockpile in one swoop I can

1263
00:48:45,569 --> 00:48:50,160
attack one database server and get

1264
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:51,900
hundreds or thousands put those on the

1265
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:56,819
dark web package them together and sell

1266
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:59,519
those big money that's why three reasons

1267
00:48:56,819 --> 00:49:01,319
why you should care again your health

1268
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:03,538
records are currency we've already

1269
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:05,819
talked about an individual or a group or

1270
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:08,190
nation-state possibly doing things to

1271
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:10,230
you and your information for that you

1272
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:12,660
have to pay for I've read in some

1273
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:16,920
instances we're out-of-pocket expenses

1274
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:20,598
averaged $18,000 I was in class with an

1275
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:23,339
individual we were in Cleveland and he

1276
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:25,619
disappeared for two days he came back it

1277
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:27,029
was a two-week class he came back and he

1278
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:29,220
had informed me that the FBI had picked

1279
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:30,960
him up and the FBI had picked him up and

1280
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,399
was holding on to him while they were

1281
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,930
doing some research and another

1282
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,610
State on someone who had assumed his

1283
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,259
identity they were having medical

1284
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:38,640
procedures done and they were able to

1285
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,200
determine that he was in Cleveland at

1286
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,430
the time and they asked him to stay you

1287
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,270
know under the radar for a couple days

1288
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:46,259
so they could try to pick this

1289
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:48,870
individual up needless to say I think

1290
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,820
they told him he was currently in debt

1291
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:52,290
at forty four thousand dollars for for

1292
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:54,060
some of the stuff that was going on with

1293
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:58,350
his identity through his medical health

1294
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:58,860
record your hospital cybersecurity might

1295
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:01,620
be leaking

1296
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:03,890
maybe not yours but mine my information

1297
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:06,330
is everywhere I told you we're kind of

1298
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:08,359
careless sometimes with it needless to

1299
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:11,640
say you know we'll give it out freely

1300
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:13,560
well we'll find you know patients need

1301
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,200
this information it's always readily

1302
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,400
available we have this this model and I

1303
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,230
know you're familiar with the model tool

1304
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,850
when you're trying to protect a system

1305
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:22,920
you've got a choice you know do you want

1306
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:24,480
full security you want usability do you

1307
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,180
want a veil ability what do you want you

1308
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,970
have to move and determine what suits

1309
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:32,009
you best well in health care of course

1310
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:33,839
we want security but we can't once we

1311
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:36,360
add and have all these controls in place

1312
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:38,430
we take away from the clinicians ease of

1313
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:40,230
use the clinician says forget I even

1314
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:42,299
want to work here anymore too much

1315
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:44,340
security I can't do my job I'm out and

1316
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,890
that's kind of the the ball we're

1317
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:49,560
playing right now so we make things easy

1318
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:51,509
oh you saw that that that meme about you

1319
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,279
know I I can function I can work a

1320
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:55,200
medical device medical devices are

1321
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,680
carrying more pho than ever and they're

1322
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:00,720
super easy to use in fact many don't

1323
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,910
open the operator's manual and they just

1324
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,620
learn as they go you know they may have

1325
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:07,799
been instructed in nursing school in

1326
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:12,240
nursing class but very frequently they

1327
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:13,770
don't open the operator's manual so it's

1328
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:17,370
very easy to to let that information

1329
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:20,870
escape you might be you might be missing

1330
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:24,690
the biggest flaw and cybersecurity

1331
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:26,940
so from 2015 to estimated 2019

1332
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:28,800
they say about one in three will be

1333
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,330
impacted one excuse me one in 13

1334
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,600
patients will have some sort of data

1335
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:36,960
breach so you can see from the graph

1336
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:38,339
here I'm kind of looking at 2019 we're

1337
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,220
talking in the millions so the light

1338
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:43,470
blue color there will have about seven

1339
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:45,990
million patients impacted from a data

1340
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:48,480
breach now impact it doesn't necessarily

1341
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:50,459
mean you're in the tank they've taken

1342
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,980
everything from you but it means they've

1343
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:55,050
collected information on you or possibly

1344
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,820
collected information on you we're then

1345
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:58,590
in the dark blue there the 1.7 you've

1346
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:01,950
been victimized they've done something

1347
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:04,470
to you and and then the green you're

1348
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:06,839
stuck paying for it so the OPP means

1349
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:08,790
out-of-pocket expense you're paying for

1350
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,170
it okay so those numbers are gonna

1351
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:13,200
continually increase you can see for

1352
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:15,960
2015 is 0.56 and patients paying

1353
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,210
out-of-pocket we're about 2019 they're

1354
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,130
gonna say 1.4 million are we paying out

1355
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:21,570
of pocket I don't know about you but

1356
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:22,920
coming out of school and having maybe so

1357
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:24,930
student loan debt and then finding that

1358
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:27,350
you owe the hospital some money it won't

1359
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,350
be fun

1360
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:32,660
so why our medical device is so

1361
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:34,160
vulnerable they lack or we lack talent

1362
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:36,509
fair enough

1363
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,310
individuals like you aren't focused in

1364
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:39,630
health care you get all the others that

1365
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:42,150
come in here and maybe your attentions

1366
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:43,470
drawn to ICS you're you're going to the

1367
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:45,750
automotive market or wherever you may be

1368
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:48,359
going that's fine but we lacked talent

1369
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:50,070
we have Cisco's and we have we don't

1370
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,020
have dedicated teams that understand the

1371
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:53,400
infrastructure some of that textbook

1372
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:55,020
stuff you learn doesn't necessarily

1373
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,000
apply again because we have patients we

1374
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:59,369
have clinicians we have to find a way to

1375
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,170
make it work we have to adapt that's why

1376
00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:04,230
some of those NIST specifications just

1377
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:06,420
don't necessarily work legacy equipment

1378
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:07,980
oh we love legacy equipment because for

1379
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,230
one medical devices are extremely

1380
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:12,510
expensive we can't just go replace every

1381
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:16,200
couple years even a software update can

1382
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:19,200
cost hundreds of thousands of dollars so

1383
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:22,950
we tend to leave equipment as it is if

1384
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:25,830
it works and leave it alone and that

1385
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:27,810
happens a lot premature or over

1386
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:29,580
connectivity we've talked about we want

1387
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:31,770
everything on the network we have 4,800

1388
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:36,119
connected devices 1200 we're designed to

1389
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:38,130
do so maybe we've overdone it web

1390
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:40,140
services for interfacing a lot of our

1391
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:42,359
devices communicate with through a web

1392
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:44,670
interface so again if you're snooping on

1393
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:46,470
the net in our network you can see that

1394
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:48,660
communication process you can attack

1395
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:50,790
that web server it's very very

1396
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,740
vulnerable to your cross-site scripting

1397
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:55,619
and your SQL injections and things like

1398
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:56,490
that because again they were implemented

1399
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:58,500
with the understanding they were

1400
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:59,520
internal they were in the network so

1401
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:03,300
they were protected

1402
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:05,520
a lack of awareness sure we have cyber

1403
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:07,380
security training our Sissel wants us to

1404
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,690
know he sends out emails all the time

1405
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:12,480
we'd have annual education we have these

1406
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:13,920
this in place but when you're focused on

1407
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:18,150
patient care can sometimes those things

1408
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,920
just don't come to mind here's a

1409
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:21,360
wonderful article I came across just the

1410
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,220
other day about an individual a security

1411
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:26,550
researcher who this is a very basic

1412
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:29,370
syringe pump but he was able to find

1413
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:31,980
wirelessly our keys wireless keys stored

1414
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:35,569
unencrypted accessed via telnet and FTP

1415
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:38,640
I had a root shell on port 23 and

1416
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:40,110
hard-coded local accounts that link in

1417
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,580
there if you go back and review this

1418
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,170
link he gives you almost a step-by-step

1419
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:45,540
process on how it was done and what he

1420
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:48,120
did now keep in mind it took him about

1421
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:50,970
400 hours to do so and that's what we're

1422
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:52,319
finding that yes it does take time but

1423
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:54,600
we've also learned that hackers have

1424
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:56,130
nothing but time so if you can walk one

1425
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,080
of these out of a hospital which is very

1426
00:54:56,130 --> 00:55:00,600
easy to do so you see that it's no

1427
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:02,460
bigger than than the device here it's

1428
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:05,430
not much larger than that you can walk

1429
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:06,810
out with that we have patients walk out

1430
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,759
with them all the time it's still

1431
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:10,110
connected they leave or they're

1432
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,970
transferred or whatever and we may never

1433
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:15,300
see it again

1434
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:20,009
okay so remote code execution on this

1435
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:21,980
device so I've got a couple slides here

1436
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:24,900
on again why they're so vulnerable

1437
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:27,540
legacy operating systems they lack

1438
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:31,560
timely software updates so even if we do

1439
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:33,810
have a Windows box that does get updates

1440
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:36,029
we have to have the manufacturer

1441
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:38,070
validate those before and they're not

1442
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:40,560
necessarily so quick to do so we're at

1443
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:41,730
least two months behind in most cases so

1444
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:44,340
if we know of a vulnerability that comes

1445
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:45,750
out or a patch comes out and by the time

1446
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,730
they evaluate it and then they give they

1447
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:51,420
us give us the approval for it it's two

1448
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:54,840
months later again medical devices lack

1449
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:57,600
any basic security features web services

1450
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:59,670
for interfacing we have local databases

1451
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,880
on the device so if you walk out the

1452
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:04,560
building with that device it's yours

1453
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,940
unsecured application software again we

1454
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,590
talked about first to mark it at the

1455
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,300
beginning so sometimes they just script

1456
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:10,620
it together some quick easy software to

1457
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,579
interface with the device or for the

1458
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:15,609
device to have so it's user friendly

1459
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:18,209
we care more about sleek sexy GUI based

1460
00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:22,089
operating systems now than ever before

1461
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:23,410
again lack of awareness lack of physical

1462
00:56:22,089 --> 00:56:25,538
logical and in any kind of

1463
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:27,038
administrative controls the passwords

1464
00:56:25,539 --> 00:56:30,130
for these things are all over the

1465
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:31,989
Internet I cannot create my own password

1466
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:34,689
for a lot of these devices so for

1467
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:35,799
instance I have several hundred pumps or

1468
00:56:34,689 --> 00:56:38,078
I have several hundreds of certain

1469
00:56:35,799 --> 00:56:40,839
devices they all have the exact same

1470
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,829
root password all of them and if you

1471
00:56:40,839 --> 00:56:43,119
want it you can just call the

1472
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:44,410
manufacturer and get it you could do a

1473
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,140
quick google search and you'll find the

1474
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:50,288
exact same password and I can't change

1475
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:53,410
that if I could I would devices again

1476
00:56:50,289 --> 00:56:55,239
are made easy to use most are embedded

1477
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:59,288
systems so again they're embedded

1478
00:56:55,239 --> 00:57:01,839
processors put expensive but inexpensive

1479
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:04,509
wimpy processors limited RAM and storage

1480
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:06,369
I kind of discussed the cost of these

1481
00:57:04,509 --> 00:57:08,859
devices so if I went back to syringe

1482
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:10,989
pump that's about an eight thousand six

1483
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:13,359
to eight thousand dollar device if we

1484
00:57:10,989 --> 00:57:15,219
were to implement better processors so

1485
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:16,959
we could do encryption if we were to

1486
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:19,049
implement where RAM we were to implement

1487
00:57:16,959 --> 00:57:21,160
these safeguards that would help us

1488
00:57:19,049 --> 00:57:23,170
we're talking about a fifteen thousand

1489
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:25,209
dollar device now so we're talking about

1490
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:26,589
more money more research more dollars on

1491
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:31,419
the manufacturer side and are we willing

1492
00:57:26,589 --> 00:57:33,400
to pay for that no encryption obviously

1493
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:35,949
no anti-malware we have very few devices

1494
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,539
these are embedded systems we may not be

1495
00:57:35,949 --> 00:57:40,179
able to put any kind of anti-malware on

1496
00:57:37,539 --> 00:57:42,400
them some manufacturers do enable us to

1497
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:46,059
if they're Windows boxes but most don't

1498
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:48,009
and our people so here's a phishing

1499
00:57:46,059 --> 00:57:50,549
email that you can see January fifth

1500
00:57:48,009 --> 00:57:53,559
fifteenth that was delivered to me

1501
00:57:50,549 --> 00:57:55,150
January 15th just says our law office is

1502
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:56,339
representing the insurance company we

1503
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:59,439
need one more piece of information

1504
00:57:56,339 --> 00:58:01,929
please click this link that's all it is

1505
00:57:59,439 --> 00:58:03,969
so wants me to click that link it's a

1506
00:58:01,929 --> 00:58:05,289
perfect easy phishing scam it looks

1507
00:58:03,969 --> 00:58:07,179
pretty good talking about a need for a

1508
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:09,910
little bit litigation they claim they're

1509
00:58:07,179 --> 00:58:11,380
a lawyer as a clinician or someone in a

1510
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:16,719
hospital I might be apt to click that

1511
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:18,459
link against some common issues lack of

1512
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:21,400
funding policies we have a lot of

1513
00:58:18,459 --> 00:58:23,439
technical issues vendors are some of our

1514
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,539
issues and our physical security I don't

1515
00:58:23,439 --> 00:58:26,230
need to hit on each one of these but

1516
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:30,880
they

1517
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:33,640
kind of been discussed throughout so

1518
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,619
what do we do what what do we do as we

1519
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,170
move forward so security should be

1520
00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:40,660
designed in that's our starting point we

1521
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:43,600
have to put that in place prior to so

1522
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:45,970
our manufacturers they need to start

1523
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:48,130
secure coding practices you know there's

1524
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:50,169
all different kinds of frameworks for

1525
00:58:48,130 --> 00:59:20,440
how we can look at code what we can do

1526
00:58:50,170 --> 00:59:22,270
with code yes sir we're trying to find

1527
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:24,820
that that line we're trying to determine

1528
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:27,100
that myself I'm training I'm researching

1529
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:29,500
to to to cross that line to work with

1530
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:31,270
our Cisco to I'm presenting him with

1531
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:36,040
this information like look we have these

1532
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:38,259
problems and he doesn't understand a not

1533
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,330
understand exactly how our devices are

1534
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:42,730
can be interrogated and what they're

1535
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:46,210
capable of he understands his side of

1536
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:48,550
the story so yes we have that gap so the

1537
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:50,950
problem is is most anything IT IT

1538
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:54,040
security IT infrastructure

1539
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:55,299
once the it's an FDA medical device that

1540
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,880
hands off they don't touch it that's

1541
00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:00,070
kind of that that line so a lot of these

1542
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:02,080
are or all of them are FDA medical

1543
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:04,869
devices so we're finding that we're

1544
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:06,880
choosing to cross that line but we have

1545
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:08,320
a lot of third-party organizations that

1546
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,730
service medical equipment that's all

1547
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,530
they do is service medical equipment

1548
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:13,060
they're not going to implement or do

1549
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:15,340
anything with security unless the

1550
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:17,619
customer wants to pay for it and right

1551
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:19,750
now that's we're trying to stress that

1552
01:00:17,619 --> 01:00:21,310
significance so we're in the infancy

1553
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:23,880
stage of really trying to get that out

1554
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:27,070
there that someone needs to step up and

1555
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:29,350
find a way but absolutely but absolutely

1556
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:31,030
same same issues that can't be bolted on

1557
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:32,560
we're finding that we're bolting it on

1558
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:34,390
now we're coming with the afterthought

1559
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:37,900
of hey let's try this so I'll get to

1560
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:39,640
that here but like what we talked about

1561
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,800
earlier what are we doing sorry

1562
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:44,049
Security Act of 2015 created the

1563
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:46,780
healthcare industry cybersecurity task

1564
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:48,790
force more or less defining roles

1565
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:50,980
finding out how to get money grant money

1566
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:52,450
what to do with that money we have some

1567
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,640
executive orders that talk about

1568
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:56,439
critical infrastructure same thing kind

1569
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,029
of what are we gonna do how we're gonna

1570
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,280
it's a lot of planning policies and

1571
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:00,700
procedures in place and then third or

1572
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,460
excuse me

1573
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:06,520
691 is promoting information sharing

1574
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:07,720
with ISOs so I've done some work with

1575
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,890
this we've looked at these

1576
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,390
vulnerabilities and we're trying to

1577
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:12,339
share this information with ISOs and

1578
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:14,500
that's what we're trying to do currently

1579
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,850
but as we kind of stated even if we have

1580
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,940
hundreds and hundreds of vulnerabilities

1581
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:20,650
for one device what does it mean and

1582
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:22,480
then the FDA came out with a post market

1583
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:24,820
management for cybersecurity and medical

1584
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,920
devices they're asking the manufacturers

1585
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:28,300
to help they're saying hey can you do

1586
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,540
something with your devices that are

1587
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:32,560
already out in the field whether it be

1588
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:35,920
patching or whatever you know those

1589
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:37,090
kinds of things so what are our

1590
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,770
challenge for healthcare delivery

1591
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:41,590
organizations we may not even have

1592
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:43,780
complete inventory assessment it sounds

1593
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:45,700
ridiculous but I told you we have 4,800

1594
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:47,290
devices but if you go next door they may

1595
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:50,439
not know how many devices they actually

1596
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:52,420
have communicating on the network so we

1597
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:55,470
need better tools for integration to

1598
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:56,920
determine this there are many

1599
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:58,180
manufacturers out there that are

1600
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,740
developing these kinds of tools but

1601
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:01,930
they're just so darn expensive we can't

1602
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:03,069
you know that we're talking about $1 per

1603
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:05,230
device that's communicating on the

1604
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:07,000
network not just our devices but all

1605
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:08,320
devices so if there's thousands and

1606
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,700
hundreds of thousands of devices on the

1607
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,890
network we're talking big money right

1608
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:13,990
now we have to integrate some of our

1609
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:16,299
security into our what we call our CMS

1610
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:18,580
database that's our management database

1611
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:21,220
for our medical devices just like IT all

1612
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:23,380
medical devices are assets we classify

1613
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:25,089
the assets we code them we risk them and

1614
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:27,040
then we put them in a database so we can

1615
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:28,570
manage them so we need to integrate

1616
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,890
security features into that we need to

1617
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:31,810
know what firmware level they have what

1618
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:33,640
operating system they have what they

1619
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:36,310
have because what if the next big thing

1620
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:38,620
comes out and we're we don't understand

1621
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:41,529
what we have what our reversions what

1622
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:43,569
level is this service pack 3 do we have

1623
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:45,580
Windows 7 a lot of organizations don't

1624
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:47,440
know that's the scary thing they don't

1625
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:50,410
know what they have and what versions

1626
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,850
and levels they have again vendors make

1627
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:54,399
it hard maybe no patches or they're

1628
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:56,049
delayed we're always a couple months but

1629
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,859
they'll sometimes give us incomplete

1630
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:58,540
responses

1631
01:02:56,859 --> 01:03:01,029
they'll say segment it or put it behind

1632
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:01,630
a firewall they'll sometimes refuse to

1633
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:03,790
cooperate

1634
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:06,130
there's these MDS two forms that we're

1635
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:07,509
asking for this is our health care

1636
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:10,330
delivery organizations way of saying hey

1637
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:12,400
how are you making your device secure so

1638
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:14,440
the security team at the manufacturer

1639
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,240
will fill out these forms and swing

1640
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:19,480
basic questions it's almost like a risk

1641
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:21,368
or set of risk questions and then as a

1642
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:23,619
delivery organization will assess it

1643
01:03:21,369 --> 01:03:26,230
we'll say okay you allow antivirus you

1644
01:03:23,619 --> 01:03:27,760
allow this you allow encryption that's

1645
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:29,500
what we're looking for and that's what

1646
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,260
we want from the vendors some aren't

1647
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:35,020
filling those out again limited

1648
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:38,440
resources too much data not enough

1649
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:40,359
people lack of cyber education no time

1650
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:42,609
too much regulation on maintenance they

1651
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:44,109
care they want us we're required to do

1652
01:03:42,609 --> 01:03:48,430
maintenance and complete our maintenance

1653
01:03:44,109 --> 01:03:51,940
on our devices again segmentation is not

1654
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:53,348
enough no specific anti-anything for

1655
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:55,330
medical devices no one's created

1656
01:03:53,349 --> 01:03:58,480
anything that we can just install it's a

1657
01:03:55,330 --> 01:04:00,910
hereof we're protected so VLANs access

1658
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,950
control lists is not cutting it black

1659
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:05,170
lists and white lists become incredibly

1660
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:07,450
hard to manage how can we do this with

1661
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:09,310
all these devices we have limited and no

1662
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:11,230
support from anti-malware and then back

1663
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:13,000
to the question earlier we're looking at

1664
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:14,170
enterprise solutions so what some of the

1665
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,230
things we've done is we've purchased

1666
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:18,640
next-gen firewalls that have management

1667
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:20,950
console and we'll plug these into

1668
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,598
certain devices and will create

1669
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:25,029
whitelists and blacklists and VLANs

1670
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:26,920
within these devices and then we'll use

1671
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:28,990
the enterprise solution console to help

1672
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,820
us manage those devices but now we're

1673
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,520
still talking about plugging in $500

1674
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:35,830
boxes behind

1675
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:40,810
4800 devices so now just another device

1676
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:41,440
tagged on to another device so cyber

1677
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,690
security

1678
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,990
it's a foreseeable risk of sabotage my

1679
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:48,520
point is yes we can see hackers are

1680
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:51,399
breaking into medical devices it takes

1681
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:54,040
time it's doable but that's okay that is

1682
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:56,230
the wide scale unavailability of patient

1683
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:58,270
cares what our concerns should be the

1684
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:59,589
ability to create a denial of service to

1685
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:01,780
a whole healthcare organization to a

1686
01:04:59,589 --> 01:05:04,690
whole city to whole state could come

1687
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:07,089
about so the integrity of medical

1688
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:08,890
devices is one of our biggest risks

1689
01:05:07,089 --> 01:05:11,109
gapps again our procurement our

1690
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:12,670
lifecycle you know when do we start

1691
01:05:11,109 --> 01:05:14,950
retiring these devices when do we say

1692
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:16,749
hey with security is not enough the

1693
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:18,848
device has to be retired how do we

1694
01:05:16,749 --> 01:05:21,549
purchase new so our procurement process

1695
01:05:18,849 --> 01:05:23,650
and lifecycle again we may not know our

1696
01:05:21,549 --> 01:05:25,630
clinical inventory that's a big gap many

1697
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:27,700
many organizations because doctors

1698
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:29,469
nurses sometimes they just bring stuff

1699
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:31,479
they buy something at Walmart they buy

1700
01:05:29,469 --> 01:05:32,739
something online on Amazon and then they

1701
01:05:31,479 --> 01:05:35,140
just say I'll just plug it into the

1702
01:05:32,739 --> 01:05:38,069
network we know one may ever know what

1703
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:40,839
it even exists and they may be using it

1704
01:05:38,069 --> 01:05:43,509
so again our challenges still training

1705
01:05:40,839 --> 01:05:45,578
job roles we don't have a specific job

1706
01:05:43,509 --> 01:05:47,559
role right now that can manage this type

1707
01:05:45,579 --> 01:05:50,079
of work that can integrate with the IT

1708
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:52,089
security IIT as well the infrastructure

1709
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:54,269
Network eyes and database guys and then

1710
01:05:52,089 --> 01:05:56,799
the bio med clinical engineering side

1711
01:05:54,269 --> 01:05:58,988
many specialists focus on technical

1712
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:00,519
controls too much technical can't do it

1713
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:03,789
when we're trying to prove our provide

1714
01:06:00,519 --> 01:06:06,729
patient care and many safety specialists

1715
01:06:03,789 --> 01:06:08,380
focus on risk management again we know

1716
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:11,468
the risk is there we need to protect the

1717
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:15,779
patients that is all I have for you

1718
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:15,779
questions do we have any other questions

1719
01:06:21,029 --> 01:06:24,630
yes maybe

1720
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:37,720
if you stick around for a bit

1721
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:37,720
folder that thank you

1722
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:41,920
[Applause]

1723
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:49,970
you
