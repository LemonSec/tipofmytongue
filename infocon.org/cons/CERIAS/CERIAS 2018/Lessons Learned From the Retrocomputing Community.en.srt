1
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,719
okay the cold weather must have chased a

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,680
few people away today so go ahead get

3
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,270
started

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,250
professor payer is not gonna make it

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,780
he's travelling again this week so he's

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,850
not gonna be able to be in class today

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,830
but it's my pleasure to introduce Mitch

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,410
Parker and Mitch is the executive

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,150
director for information security and

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,920
compliance at IU Health and Indianapolis

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,390
so he's currently working on

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,340
redeveloping information security

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,250
program at IU Health and regularly works

14
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:39,070
in lots of non technology and technology

15
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,050
areas so he's been a speaker a lot of

16
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,969
conferences and a lot of a lot of

17
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,099
workshops if you're familiar with hims

18
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:47,739
he's he's big in the hims organization

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,600
and as a speaker there and he's been

20
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:51,788
also a proponent of the Internet of

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,899
medical things so I think you'll enjoy

22
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:54,879
his talk today

23
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:57,070
he's holds a bachelor's degree in

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,899
computer science from Bloomsburg and MS

25
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,600
and information technology from LaSalle

26
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,910
and his MBA from Temple so he's well

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,460
traveled and so all with adding further

28
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,080
dill introduced Mitch thank you very

29
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,910
much and yes well traveled up and down

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,619
Broad Street and Philadelphia I'd like

31
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,780
to put it as a salad temple or a couple

32
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:15,070
only a couple miles from each other so

33
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,659
what I'm going to talk about today is

34
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,240
lessons learned from the retro computing

35
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:20,860
community and purpose of what I'm doing

36
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,240
today is to show that successful retro

37
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,710
computing projects in groups which

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,360
currently exist they follow patterns

39
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,158
that we can use to help a lot of low

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,929
resource at industrial organizations

41
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,390
that really need the secure their

42
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,920
devices so I am from the Philadelphia

43
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,049
area a little bit of background on that

44
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,149
is that in the Philadelphia area

45
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:40,360
probably the most famous computer

46
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:42,430
flameout of the early 90s was a company

47
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,820
called Commodore computers based in

48
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:47,170
Westchester Pennsylvania and famous for

49
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,148
at one time being a multi-billion dollar

50
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,329
company and getting sold off for parts

51
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:54,009
in 1994 so Who am I

52
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:55,119
Gary talked about in the executive

53
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,640
director of information security

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,649
compliance at IU Health I have been a

55
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,810
CISO for over nine years both at IU

56
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:04,000
Health and at Temple University Health

57
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,610
System I've got over 30 years using

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,300
computers despite my youth I started out

59
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:11,650
with a Commodore 64 back in 1984 I still

60
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,840
have one of them set up obviously not

61
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,940
the original one which has probably some

62
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,910
landfill somewhere but I also have my

63
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,070
candy 102 my candy 200 mi tan DW

64
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,010
to which I actually occasionally take

65
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,140
out in use and I taught myself computers

66
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,090
by taking my old computers apart and

67
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,940
putting them back together again then I

68
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,760
went through a lot of Commodore trs-80

69
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:37,180
Tandy and PC clone hardware that way I

70
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,220
mean a lot since I got married and had

71
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,760
kids a lot of hardware has been given

72
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,770
away so what is retrocomputing for those

73
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,870
of you who don't know it's the use of a

74
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,970
lot of older classic computer and

75
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,220
hardware hardware and software now and

76
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,070
the vast majority of platforms as covers

77
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,390
are from the 1980s and 90s and the most

78
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,760
represented platforms you gotta have out

79
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,500
there and again this is a no particular

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,630
order or preference for those of you in

81
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,540
the room that may have one I have no I

82
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:07,299
have no interest in reenact in the BBS

83
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,700
flame wars of the 80s so yeah yeah the

84
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:14,140
Apple 2 family which includes the Apple

85
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:16,540
2 2 2 + 2 e 2 C + 2 GS and I can tell

86
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,059
you I've met was incredibly incredibly

87
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,340
nice guy and will tell you everything

88
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,950
about the Apple 2 to this day you have

89
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,540
the Commodore 64 128 you have the

90
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,060
Commodore Amiga and it's descendants and

91
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,609
clones the Atari home computers and the

92
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,040
ST sorry for aus - eggs for leading out

93
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,630
the TT when I wrote this deck you have

94
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,220
the Sinclair spectrum and his clones I

95
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,040
put this as specific significance

96
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,290
because this computer was so easy to

97
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,630
build that a large number of them were

98
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,880
actually rebuilt in the Soviet bloc by

99
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,859
former Soviet by the for Soviet bloc

100
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,930
countries themselves so literally

101
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,450
there's one case where people actually

102
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,370
rebuilt the spectrum using literally

103
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,190
household parts and things that cobbled

104
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,720
together out of scrap metal in Romania

105
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,090
back in the 80s which isn't pretty

106
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,340
incredible and of course you got to

107
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,830
mention - Tandy trs-80 portables and

108
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,500
desktops and of course - Tandy model 100

109
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,750
series which was the first real computer

110
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,370
you would call laptop and part of that

111
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,130
was written by a Microsoft engineer

112
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,350
named Bill Gates and of course you got

113
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:21,459
to mention the TI 99 for a series first

114
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:23,560
16-bit home computer so why these

115
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,680
computers are very simple and very easy

116
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,510
to use and fix the Sinclair spectrum I

117
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,370
mentioned before used a processor called

118
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,320
the za

119
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,890
from a company called zilog which at one

120
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,420
time was part of exxon and there are so

121
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,250
many of these processors on the market

122
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,830
that to this day you can still find that

123
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,810
part all over the place and there's

124
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,310
significantly less complex than modern

125
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,770
computers I sometimes call it

126
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,720
deceptively complex but you can really

127
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,359
get to know the platform really well and

128
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,880
many compute community members in the IT

129
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,470
community grew up with them and entire

130
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,990
communities have sprung up around this

131
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:01,580
so I will bring up the first and most

132
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:04,110
popular ones IRC Internet Relay Chat and

133
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,469
also back in the 80s before there was

134
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,660
IRC and the internet was popular and

135
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,910
well not in universities you had

136
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,710
CompuServe you had a little company in

137
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,110
Virginia called quantum link that grew

138
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:18,090
to become America online you had PC

139
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,070
Pursuit and yet a bunch of other 80s

140
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,830
online services many of which charged a

141
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,870
lot of money and of course the most

142
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:29,099
infamous one for hackers the Versa dial

143
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:31,170
a kad dial 300 baud you could take seven

144
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,750
Apple cat modems drop them in an apple -

145
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:36,960
and boom instant chat line back when

146
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,480
your average computer had about 64k of

147
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,609
RAM this was ridiculously popular and

148
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,410
you had often had several them in the

149
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,470
same city there were - I was aware of in

150
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:49,740
Chicago - in Philadelphia and at least

151
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,910
one in New York City and I would say out

152
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,480
of the hacker community this is probably

153
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:57,840
most famous / infamous take your pick

154
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,130
online social community and a lot of

155
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,390
them were quote-unquote linked

156
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:05,640
nationally back before long-distance was

157
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,380
free long distance cost a lot of money

158
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,390
and so there used to be services called

159
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,669
out dials you used to be able to use to

160
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,360
link services together in different

161
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:16,080
cities

162
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,930
so people link their D dials in places

163
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,450
like Canada Chicago New York all over

164
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,460
the place to talk and yes it's still

165
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,990
emulated and running to this day I'm

166
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,900
honest I'm a member of a Facebook page

167
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,610
for D dial and still haven't logged into

168
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,880
that one detail system in Florida but

169
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,550
it's there so what's my community

170
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,550
experience this is not an excuse for all

171
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,870
the hours I spent on IRC or D dial I

172
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,130
learned computer insecurity in the early

173
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:46,530
1990s pre-internet being popped

174
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,659
heck I will tell you that back when 900

175
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,400
numbers are popular the local internet

176
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,720
service provider actually offered a 900

177
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,049
number as an option to called it once a

178
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,090
month in a pager bill and I learned

179
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,199
pre-internet at the end of the BBS a

180
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,299
year at during the transition to the

181
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,310
internet I learned a lot from working

182
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,560
and participating a lot with friends and

183
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,449
acquaintances as they worked and towards

184
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,340
the end I started writing documentation

185
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,949
testing and connecting others with

186
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,340
resources they needed and sharing

187
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:18,389
hardware with those who develops I

188
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:20,159
remember one day driving 40 miles into

189
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,590
South Jersey to pick up a Commodore 128

190
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,789
D for a friend in Scranton Pennsylvania

191
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,460
neither one because I was gonna be up

192
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:29,430
there later that day why cuz it was 60

193
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,469
bucks and the guy wouldn't ship so what

194
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,120
makes this community unique they've

195
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,009
worked their way through innumerable

196
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,590
challenges to keep hardware and software

197
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:39,389
running far beyond its useful expected

198
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,130
lifetime and they've managed to do so

199
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,080
despite some of the most onerous

200
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,930
rightholders withholding information or

201
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,550
not even knowing where it really is so

202
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,669
I'm gonna give one very important case

203
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:53,099
in point when Commodore went under in

204
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:56,340
1994 and was pretty much sold off for

205
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:59,729
parts a number of companies bought said

206
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:02,190
parts and what happened is there was a

207
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,260
lot of legal fights over the rights to

208
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,719
some of that Commodore intellectual

209
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:09,210
property some of which got so intense

210
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,889
that I could name at least one executive

211
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,080
of a company that had a lot of ex

212
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:15,180
Commodore employees that when he does

213
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,340
case studies for his class at Temple

214
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,280
University will not even mention the

215
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:24,000
Commodore name out of fear of some sort

216
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,130
of legal repercussion and also they've

217
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,470
done so without major corporations

218
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,000
funding them so there's an interesting

219
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,700
case I actually sent this deck to be

220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,110
reviewed by Trevor Dickenson this man in

221
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,789
particular multi millionaire

222
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,860
entrepreneur happens like Commodore

223
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:40,199
Amiga is a lot so there was no new

224
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,110
amigas being made so he funded a couple

225
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,610
of you so and literally he spent several

226
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,839
million dollars of his own money paid an

227
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,450
engineering company to make him an Amiga

228
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,700
and he sold him something he sold

229
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:53,130
several thousand of money internets so

230
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,720
he's done an incredible job you did an

231
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,580
operating system pay developers to write

232
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,950
the operating system

233
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,890
very rare exception matter of fact he's

234
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,300
dealing when I could find everything is

235
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,260
almost completely bootstrapped and

236
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,120
self-funded and it's pretty incredible

237
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,900
so what makes it unique this is a

238
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,360
do-it-yourself

239
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,860
punk rock hacker ethos community so

240
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,710
these are the original hackers from back

241
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,210
in the day and many of these community

242
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,370
members are still active in corporate IT

243
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,830
although you'd never know it unless you

244
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,390
really asked them and they do it for

245
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,640
themselves there's no corporate

246
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,140
interests in there remember this is

247
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,110
do-it-yourself and they actually kind of

248
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,819
shun corporate interests and a big part

249
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,250
of reason why is some corporations and

250
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,470
rights holders have been very hostile to

251
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,600
the retro computing community and I'll

252
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,520
be honest about something for those of

253
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,670
you from said large corporations viewing

254
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,990
this video right now you don't know who

255
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,329
these people are that are asking you

256
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,640
about this information from some of your

257
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:53,010
twenty plus year old IP some of them now

258
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,220
are decision makers and executives at

259
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:59,310
large companies and when you blow them

260
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:02,160
off or give them curt answers it will

261
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,959
negatively reflect on your business and

262
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,020
I'm not saying that to be bad I'm saying

263
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,510
that because bad customer service leads

264
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,590
to some issues like I said you don't

265
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,630
know what these people do for their day

266
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,150
jobs I can name several very highly

267
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,770
placed IT executives that are active in

268
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,990
the retro computing community including

269
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:22,230
one that holds several patents for

270
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:26,070
things we use every day so why am I

271
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,540
doing this realistic reason because many

272
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:31,310
of the solutions out there and

273
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,240
implementations are people are taking

274
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,729
cybersecurity implementations that are

275
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,130
point solutions and saying they address

276
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:40,500
and assess risk this is a big problem

277
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,820
and as I see so I see that as being a

278
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,140
big issue because you can't buy

279
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,910
something out of a catalogue or

280
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,230
something from a company that's going to

281
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,750
magically fix all your problems it's

282
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,150
just never gonna happen that way and you

283
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,650
can't assess and address this risk if

284
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,930
you don't know what it really is or what

285
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,250
it means and you don't know what it

286
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,800
means unless you understand the whole

287
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,270
system and these people really

288
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,400
understand systems and they understand

289
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:04,620
them well and this community does a

290
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,949
better job of understanding systems and

291
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,780
assessing risk in any community I know

292
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,499
we've forgotten a lot and we will forget

293
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,939
more than most

294
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:14,279
people have ever learned and we can

295
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:17,909
learn a lot from them and apply it to

296
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:19,289
modern technologies so case in point I'm

297
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:21,509
gonna talk about industrial devices and

298
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:23,309
industrial device security there's a

299
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:24,839
number of companies out there that have

300
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:27,509
products such as industrial robots

301
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,149
medical devices SCADA systems standing

302
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:32,099
for supervisory control acquisition data

303
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:33,799
acquisition or control systems with

304
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:35,429
twenty to thirty year lifecycle

305
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:37,499
realistically that's what they plan and

306
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:39,718
budget for and in many cases this

307
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:43,049
equipment was already built on obsolete

308
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:46,589
hot hardware and software so I'll give a

309
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:48,829
real-life example of this 22 years ago I

310
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:53,189
worked as an intern in a company doing

311
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:55,378
PLC development and ladder logic we were

312
00:11:53,189 --> 00:12:01,799
putting forty six a--'s in the

313
00:11:55,379 --> 00:12:03,359
industrial robots in 1996 at 1996 the

314
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,279
processor to use was the penny and were

315
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:07,439
Petty and Pro we were already a couple

316
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,669
generations behind why because it was

317
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:11,699
the only equipment back then he could

318
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:13,169
rack mounts and he can't expect this

319
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:15,179
equipment to be upgraded like a PC on

320
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:17,509
Patch Tuesday oh and I forgot to mention

321
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:22,348
that this Hardware metla ran Windows 3.1

322
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:25,919
with on top of ms-dos 6 - so it was very

323
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:27,629
obsolete already and with the emphasis

324
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,169
now on quantitative management which I

325
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:32,669
got a big exposure to and I got my MBA

326
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:34,559
there's often expectations of every

327
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:37,289
device out there send performance data

328
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:40,559
for analysis including the devices that

329
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:43,619
were never meant to do so ie the PC from

330
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:47,579
1996 running running a robot out there

331
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:49,349
somewhere and in addition another

332
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:50,998
business trend there's been an emphasis

333
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:52,289
and centralizing management and

334
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:54,329
operations of companies into what they

335
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:56,639
call Centers of Excellence rough

336
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:58,138
translation there's been a lot of

337
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,819
mergers and acquisitions over the past

338
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,829
20 years perfect example of that is

339
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:05,848
General Electric another example I could

340
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:06,959
give is IBM and the real translation for

341
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:09,239
those of us in the room that work with

342
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,858
technology is they want to run the

343
00:13:09,239 --> 00:13:12,629
actual production sites as lean as

344
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:14,999
possible with as few people as possible

345
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:17,999
to reduce the number of people actually

346
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:19,919
there and reduce costs using centralized

347
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:21,920
monitoring which means they want to

348
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,389
network everything

349
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,670
coupled with that the number of people

350
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:29,250
in the workforce who built or maintained

351
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:31,050
these systems is slowly dwindling due to

352
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:34,350
retirement or certain or attrition

353
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:36,750
outside of the bump we got from y2k when

354
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:40,199
pretty much give you new COBOL you were

355
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:43,130
worth six figures we're seeing a lot of

356
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:44,969
retirements coupled with the fact that

357
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,680
especially in the case of the US

358
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,420
government a very large amount of the

359
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,439
workforce in the US government that was

360
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,810
under the old Civil Service Retirement

361
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,120
System were given payouts to leave

362
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:56,939
because of the old defined Ben pension

363
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,449
benefit the government had iBM is doing

364
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,279
really well

365
00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:02,040
why because they run their own schools

366
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,779
to train people on this stuff very few

367
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,149
companies out there actually run their

368
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:08,160
own schools to train people and I can

369
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:11,430
mean to IBM and a security company

370
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,469
outside of Detroit Michigan and that and

371
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,810
a lot of this industrial equipment is

372
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,980
being networked and in many cases the

373
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:20,729
original information used to build a

374
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:24,630
system it's gone why this a major risk

375
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,709
I'll give you three wanna cry Petya and

376
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,630
not Petya

377
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:30,599
there are a host of other active threats

378
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:32,519
out there such as Mirai and the various

379
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,069
huge amounts of worms out there

380
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:38,819
attacking your arm based devices or x86

381
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:40,380
to base devices every day and a major

382
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:42,509
propagation fact where vulnerabilities

383
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,720
is when you don't address or assess risk

384
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:47,220
vault or vulnerabilities correctly when

385
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,319
I talk to executives about what the

386
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,079
major cause of data breaches is I tell

387
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:52,979
them the systems aren't maintained first

388
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,870
time I ever get had to give a

389
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,689
presentation to the c-suite at my

390
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,329
current organization I was doing prep

391
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:02,130
with one of the executives before and

392
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:06,508
she sent me two data breaches I didn't

393
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:08,040
cover in my prep deck both of them I had

394
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:09,660
covered in five minutes after doing

395
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,459
research because I literally took a look

396
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,160
at it they didn't patch they didn't

397
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:15,930
catch got up in front of 30 executives

398
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,029
and basically said you've got a patch in

399
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,500
maintain your systems and you'll take

400
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:25,680
care of 90% of your problems we do this

401
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:28,230
and after a few months they got them to

402
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,149
believe me and buy into that but again

403
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,380
that's what it comes down to and when

404
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:32,730
you sit there and tell them you give

405
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,800
them these huge data breaches such as

406
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,899
OPM

407
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,689
what 25 million records breached and the

408
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:40,160
reason why it wasn't because you didn't

409
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,019
have someone wasn't wearing the latest

410
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,699
and greatest latest in greatest security

411
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:46,010
software they're running a three year

412
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,200
old version of Oracle forms that had not

413
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:50,149
received security updates and was not

414
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:54,200
going to receive security updates and

415
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:57,110
this is not Oracle's fault Oracle told

416
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:00,230
the government this is old and obsolete

417
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:02,120
software you need to replace it which is

418
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:06,529
why the old OPM administrator is now

419
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:09,230
looking for a job so another piece when

420
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:10,939
I did my research for this powe is that

421
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,220
you literally will have these devices

422
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,350
show up a network they're available to

423
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,970
entire corporations not to a branch

424
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,980
office not to a defined segment you'll

425
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,600
literally find somebody you figured out

426
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,000
how to do a serial to Ethernet adapter

427
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,870
or a next thing you know you've got an

428
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,750
industrial robot showing up on your

429
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,709
corporate network and when these devices

430
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,180
were being designed

431
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:31,010
they were just figuring out how

432
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,569
networking and these technologies works

433
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:35,810
so even securing them is a major

434
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:37,370
challenge and this sounds similar to the

435
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,130
challenges the retro computing community

436
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,720
faces so we're going to go over to

437
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,760
following changes they've following

438
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,440
challenges they've addressed

439
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:48,200
collaboration and communication focus

440
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,720
social communities lost poor or

441
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,490
incomplete documentation reverse

442
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,380
engineering of hardware and software and

443
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,630
again working around bugs years and

444
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,589
after effect building Newell to building

445
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:01,880
new tools addressing tasks at hand

446
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:03,589
emphasis on preserving the experience

447
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,929
and putting solutions in place to

448
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,189
preserve security so then we're going to

449
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:10,160
go over how we cannot apply these

450
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:13,280
lessons to to our businesses so we can

451
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,850
better protect ourselves so there's any

452
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,709
community any or the group that

453
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:20,839
leverages collaboration communication

454
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:24,020
it's the retro computing community there

455
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:26,629
are mailing lists IRC channels BBS's

456
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,339
over telnet though I don't think anyone

457
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,550
I know is doing dial-up BBS's anymore

458
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,980
they are I'd be surprised and bulletin

459
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,389
boards that you use for communication

460
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,070
there's always someone at the other end

461
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:39,140
always willing to answer questions or

462
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:43,040
research and there's no real hierarchy

463
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:45,080
it's a meritocracy built on delivering

464
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,340
information or products and there's an

465
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,299
informal expectation that you will

466
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,209
contribute or help

467
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:52,519
in some way shape or form there's also a

468
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,809
very strong conference community with

469
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:55,249
this group that has an emphasis on

470
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:57,230
presenting these findings or new

471
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:59,299
developments so biggest one I'm gonna

472
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,610
give is vintage computer festival which

473
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:04,730
hosts events in the East Coast Midwest

474
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:06,110
West Coast and I believe they have they

475
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,190
have them in San Francisco and Seattle

476
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,738
now I have to check with having

477
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:13,129
compliments on that who does a lot of

478
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:14,330
work for him but again this is great I

479
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:16,279
tell you one the best retrocomputing

480
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,600
enthusiasts I know is actually goes to

481
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:20,720
all these events he's based out of

482
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:24,590
Chicago you have hackers on planet Earth

483
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,090
which every year in New York City at set

484
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,459
I think at the hotel Pennsylvania it's

485
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,529
run by 2600 magazine and they do a lot

486
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,539
of work they actually have a

487
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:34,789
retrocomputing table set up by the

488
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:36,590
finished computer Federation you will

489
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:39,200
see a lot of them at Def Con and black

490
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:41,178
hats many of them go here I can tell you

491
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,259
at a conversation I first got to Indiana

492
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:47,379
with somebody about someone they knew

493
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:49,700
from Def Con 20 years ago

494
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:52,189
there's the Commodore Amiga conventions

495
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,960
was yes they still exist the Apple and

496
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,480
Atari ST conventions I believe there's

497
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,039
an apple convention in st. Louis that

498
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,320
gets several hundred people a year and

499
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,460
the local user groups and yes there is

500
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,639
one here in Indiana

501
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,220
I think they meet about half hour north

502
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:09,320
of my house and I'm down in Carmel and

503
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,730
the summary is people want to share

504
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,149
information freely in this community and

505
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:16,009
they're gonna do so so one other

506
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:19,248
critical aspect you can't overlook is

507
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:22,970
focus so these days social media is

508
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:27,230
marked by mayhem and trolling and quite

509
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:29,859
frankly just general chaos as the as the

510
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:32,239
events of Twitter today show us

511
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:34,939
but these communities they are very

512
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:37,249
focused on addressing task at hand while

513
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,889
the 2016 presidential election was quite

514
00:19:37,249 --> 00:19:41,809
frankly incredibly divisive on social

515
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:44,769
media you'd never know it from these

516
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:47,840
groups so groups like Club 100 which

517
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:50,210
tandy laptops website mailing lists the

518
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,029
Commodore 64 and 128 grew up on Facebook

519
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,559
and the IRC channels are very intolerant

520
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:57,470
of political discussion of trolling and

521
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,700
they will not hesitate to boot you if

522
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,880
you bring every star amber got those

523
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,270
conversations

524
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,160
and this is what I use and it was so bad

525
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:09,360
constant trolling that's kind of what

526
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:11,370
killed Usenet and they're very focused I

527
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,439
mean you have a mix of ages backgrounds

528
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:15,209
geographies and ethnicities who

529
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,100
participate in these forms especially

530
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,410
the Commodore ones where most of the

531
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,560
people are actually from Western and

532
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:24,450
Eastern Europe but again you never know

533
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:28,290
about the political issues in Europe if

534
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:30,840
you were on the IRC and you also have a

535
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:33,629
very large district or ship number of US

536
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,179
Armed Services veterans because reason

537
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,710
why very simple many of the people who

538
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,380
learn computing back in the 80s in the

539
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:42,570
70s they got their start in the Army

540
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,110
because back with computers cost as much

541
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:48,540
as a new car you wanted access to one

542
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:51,689
have you enlisted you had access very

543
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,520
simple but the truth is they leave it at

544
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:56,730
the door and when addressing issues and

545
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,990
challenges and there are many lessons to

546
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,990
be learned here from this and I'm gonna

547
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,540
actually suffix this with especially for

548
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,920
the information security community and

549
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,440
they all can have the viewpoints they do

550
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,470
right wing left wing or whatever they

551
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,150
can still work together no matter any of

552
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,790
their differences and they still get

553
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:17,700
work done and they can tell you from

554
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:19,649
personal experience you get both ends of

555
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,560
the spectrum and I've never had an issue

556
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:25,950
and when people have brought them up

557
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:28,050
they've been asked to leave so you get

558
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,060
brings us to lost poor and incomplete

559
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:32,190
documentation this is the biggest

560
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,960
challenge a lot of people face because

561
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,910
many of these systems lack any kind of

562
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,190
proper documentation and if they did

563
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,170
have it it's most likely gone by now

564
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,150
except for the great work Google didn't

565
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:45,330
pretty much preserving Usenet from the

566
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:48,060
70s and 80s and putting it available

567
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,800
online as part of Google News quite

568
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,510
frankly if Google hadn't done that a

569
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,639
huge amount of history for Commodore

570
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:57,030
computers would have gone by the wayside

571
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:00,570
or being permanently lost so big props

572
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:03,330
to Google on that so what's left is

573
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:06,720
still on paper or of electronic still in

574
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,830
the original disk or tape formats so

575
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,720
what's happens

576
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,820
community members post what they need on

577
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,170
a website or forum other communities

578
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,790
will research and

579
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,650
give what they have they'll put it up on

580
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,629
a website they'll put it up on Dropbox

581
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,760
door we're gonna put it up on a BBS to

582
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:24,210
download and these people will go to

583
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,370
flea markets ham fests vintage computer

584
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,600
festival local groups or hacker

585
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:30,060
conventions to purchase this equipment

586
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,560
or documentation and they'll scan it in

587
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,399
they'll post that they have it I mean

588
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,800
there's somebody I know

589
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,220
literally he'll pick up old computing

590
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,600
magazines scan him put them in PDF post

591
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,410
where he's got him and people download

592
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,120
them and in this particular case this is

593
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:48,990
very interesting or some software in the

594
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:51,949
Amiga community that was thought to be

595
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:54,180
lost they contacted the original author

596
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:56,010
brought him back into the community he

597
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,820
got a new release of software out of it

598
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:01,500
guy's name was Jim drew I believe and

599
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,419
they will contact original authors and

600
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,550
companies and sometimes this brings them

601
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,630
back into the community and again the

602
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,659
other way of seeing us a lot has been

603
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:11,820
with Nintendo games people will contact

604
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,190
the original authors of Nintendo games

605
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,919
and what's happened is you've seen a lot

606
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:19,050
of roms of what were once thought to be

607
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:22,830
lost games downloadable on the Internet

608
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:24,270
and they will make best efforts to

609
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,550
reconstruct what they don't have and

610
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,560
they will often collaborate to piece

611
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:31,909
together info like amateur archaeologist

612
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:34,230
it's actually pretty cool to watch and

613
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:36,030
they will fill in the blanks and put

614
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,520
together documentation in a standard

615
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:40,590
format and yes they will build equipment

616
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,910
to read the old formats I'll give a

617
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,500
perfect example it's a little something

618
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,150
called cryo flux you can get off the

619
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,460
it's a disk drive you can get off the

620
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,650
internet designed to do low-level disk

621
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,200
reads of three and a half five and a

622
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,970
quarter and eight inch disks yes they

623
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,790
did at one time make eight inch discs

624
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:59,130
and what this does is because standard

625
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:01,110
disc readers weren't capable of reading

626
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:05,180
past some of the errors this reads

627
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:08,639
magnetic flux patterns that's dedication

628
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:10,200
and what's the end result collaborative

629
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,600
communities working together to rebuild

630
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,530
relevant documentation and while it's

631
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:18,570
not perfect it's a start and in some I

632
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,740
should have put many cases it's the

633
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,830
improvement over the original

634
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,300
documentation why because you have to

635
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:26,189
because a lot of people reverse engineer

636
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,860
it and when documentation isn't enough

637
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:29,230
you have to

638
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,600
how it really works and you were dealing

639
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,980
with situations where 99% at a time

640
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,750
except for the rare cases I talked about

641
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,990
before you're not going to have access

642
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,309
to source code or the developers

643
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:41,170
therefore these people will reverse

644
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:42,610
engineer and document using emulators

645
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:45,610
and virtualized environments to

646
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,100
determine exactly how systems work this

647
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,510
means they will take the extra time to

648
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,449
disassemble code libraries and determine

649
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:54,720
exactly what lines of code executed

650
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:57,280
where sound like malware research

651
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,720
perfect example I can give of this of

652
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,230
determining how something works under

653
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,610
very specific corner cases was a game

654
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,410
for a Super Nintendo called Speedy

655
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:07,899
Gonzales based off of the old Warner

656
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:10,570
Brothers character so what happened is

657
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:14,230
is the programmers that built this game

658
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,309
were incredibly ridiculously talented to

659
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,429
the point where they were able to get

660
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:20,799
more performance out of four megahertz

661
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:22,410
than they should have and they used some

662
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,520
dirty tricks and the hardware to do it

663
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,679
so someone that wrote one of the Super

664
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:30,120
Nintendo emulators and I read this an

665
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,200
ARS technica five years ago literally

666
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,270
figured out how to game operate it

667
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,980
because there was a glitch caused by how

668
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:39,760
this one programmer programmed in Speedy

669
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:43,260
Gonzales in level six and what he did he

670
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,160
figured out exactly what the glitch was

671
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,410
reverse-engineered it published the

672
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,790
results of his emulator and got an

673
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:51,040
article on ARS technica out of it which

674
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:53,379
meant that a lot of people out there got

675
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,710
to see firsthand what this man did and

676
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:59,320
it was absolutely brilliant and this is

677
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,940
the kind of dedication and this is the

678
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,610
kind of people you need disassembling

679
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,140
malware why because they know how it

680
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,549
works and they can get those corner

681
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,980
cases working and a lot of the malware

682
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:10,360
we're seeing these days uses similar

683
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,910
techniques to what the video game

684
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,059
programmers used in the 80s everything

685
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:18,190
old becomes new again and some of the

686
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:20,010
more motivated ones will document ships

687
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,720
using logic analyzers and other tools

688
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:24,820
custom builds the determine exactly had

689
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,169
our Hardware operates and they will

690
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,990
document what they have and share it

691
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:34,059
part of the reason why a lot of this

692
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:36,100
hardware it's dying the there's only a

693
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,620
finite number of Commodore 64's or

694
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,610
Commodore Amiga that were made

695
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,559
unfortunately both of those computers

696
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,809
used a lot of

697
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:45,120
some ships as common or had their own

698
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,620
ship foundry they were able to do this

699
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,570
and what happened is they didn't exactly

700
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,699
put out good documentation those chips

701
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,769
unlike the woz who documented everything

702
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,720
he could about the Apple too and made

703
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:55,860
sure everyone had it and I'm sure if it

704
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,190
wasn't out there on the internet he'd

705
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,539
pay for it to be out there these days

706
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,340
these people are going out there reverse

707
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,509
engineering what these chips did so they

708
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,039
can make sure the emulators can emulate

709
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:06,860
them because the hardware is dying which

710
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,419
means software can't run anymore

711
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:12,120
you have to be able to do it it's very

712
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,860
important it also gives you additional

713
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,889
knowledge of how the systems work and

714
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,809
where the risks really are or in a case

715
00:27:16,889 --> 00:27:21,029
of some of the more brilliant video game

716
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:23,009
programmers how to make us how to make a

717
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:26,940
Super Nintendo applet real-time video

718
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:29,419
and as part of your documentation would

719
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:32,220
reverse engineering process you will

720
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:34,860
find often very hard to reproduce bugs

721
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,299
and they will find something that took

722
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,918
you years to discover however

723
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:39,960
there's several ciao there's several

724
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,249
challenges here much like Speedy

725
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,210
Gonzales would have talked about earlier

726
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:44,309
in a Super Nintendo

727
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,139
people for I knew about this bug and use

728
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:47,908
it to their advantage or as I like to

729
00:27:46,139 --> 00:27:49,619
refer to it as many of the demo coders

730
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:52,740
who programmed demos for a Commodore 64

731
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:54,269
and Amiga who were infamous for that and

732
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,909
if you try and fix it in hardware or

733
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:59,580
software you have a chance of breaking

734
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:01,889
existing systems we see a lot of that

735
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,389
today Microsoft had that problem years

736
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:06,209
ago before they put the side-by-side

737
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:08,969
libraries and windows and which we used

738
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,320
to call DLL hell and if you fix it you

739
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:13,110
need to be able to operate in both a

740
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,779
broken and fixed state emulators do this

741
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:17,969
a lot as did Windows with its

742
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:21,480
quote/unquote shims which are really

743
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:23,460
popular before Windows 10 and the most

744
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,529
popular solution for when you find these

745
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,629
bugs is integrate the solution into an

746
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:29,970
emulator with an option to turn it on or

747
00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:34,529
off so I know when you a he does that

748
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:39,809
qemu which emulates x86 computers DOSBox

749
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:41,549
vice or mommy code fix fix only to

750
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:44,009
programs that need it and offer it as an

751
00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:46,350
option or patch the media community is

752
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:47,940
really good about that and there's a

753
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,259
broad-based solution you document the

754
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,429
living heck out of it and communicate

755
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:52,429
that everyone you know

756
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,580
so when you talk about building new

757
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:01,240
tools most of the original development

758
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:04,280
environments they show their age order

759
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,990
unusable on modern computers because a

760
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,520
lot of development environments use some

761
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:10,250
of the same hooks you use to make demos

762
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,650
run there's a lot of new technologies to

763
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,760
take advantage of so what a lot of

764
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,830
people do is they develop their own

765
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,870
tools on newer platforms that can either

766
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:20,270
interface with the emulators or actual

767
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,110
devices via the interfaces kind of like

768
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,629
what people used to do a Palm Pilot

769
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,770
development 20 years ago and it allows

770
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:27,080
you to speed up your development by

771
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:28,430
action by using modern tools and it

772
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,500
allows you to debug issues more

773
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:32,600
thoroughly by again using some of the

774
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,670
modern tools you're gonna be a lot more

775
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,870
productive using some of the GNU the

776
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:39,680
buggers and you were some of the stuff

777
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:41,419
from 30 years ago and you have to have

778
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,740
that emphasis on addressing the tasks at

779
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,270
hand you look at a fight in the finite

780
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,220
number of hours in a day you can

781
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:47,720
actually do something and these are

782
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,520
people doing this in their spare time

783
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,170
and they're folk they focused their

784
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,639
successful projects around a limited

785
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:54,860
scope that addresses the tasks at hand

786
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,110
and while it take them might take a

787
00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:00,620
while to complete the development is

788
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:03,129
very usually transparent and open and in

789
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:06,080
many cases can be downloaded via github

790
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:08,840
however they address to get they address

791
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,310
the key issues and the focus is on

792
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,110
preserving and reproducing the user

793
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,610
experience in his original and manner as

794
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,810
possible there's not about making a

795
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,939
modern experience because people

796
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:19,399
wouldn't use it it's not authentic you

797
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,320
have to keep it original univis emulated

798
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,840
you preserve it you go out of your way

799
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,370
to not changes and if there's new

800
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,449
features you integrate them in such a

801
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,370
way that integrates with the old

802
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:31,250
environment and more importantly can be

803
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:33,919
turned off so I can think of all the

804
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:36,140
modifications for a trs-80 one model 100

805
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,610
and 102 you can turn them all off and

806
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,430
return back to your stock hardware

807
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:42,530
whenever you'd like and there's new

808
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:44,150
hardware and software features don't in

809
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:46,190
it don't make them part of the core user

810
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:48,590
experience keep them away make it

811
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:49,910
something someone has to turn on because

812
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:55,540
you don't want to ruin that experience

813
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:57,920
and also people forget muscle memory and

814
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,540
user experience and if you mess with

815
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,790
that you mess with someone's workflow

816
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,040
you're gonna have a pretty major issue

817
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:05,750
which is major a big reason why a lot of

818
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,490
software projects fail a lot of upgrades

819
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:09,620
fail that's because you change

820
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:12,140
someone's workflow so drastically they

821
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,250
don't know what to do and remember

822
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,640
you're dealing with poor documentation

823
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:18,650
most of the time so you have to preserve

824
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,270
an experience now there's new hardware

825
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:23,570
you keep the cost down and the hardware

826
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:25,879
as common as possible and like woz did

827
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:28,280
with the Apple 2 you publish everything

828
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,990
you make it so you can open up a book in

829
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,660
whoa look here's the hardware block

830
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,890
Tiger of everything I ever did document

831
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,200
everything about how to install it and

832
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:37,970
you use common low cost hardware

833
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,000
solutions that anyone can implement or

834
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:44,420
as I could do a tour substitute here

835
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,550
Raspberry Pi which for $35 has taken the

836
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,710
hobbyist world by storm because it could

837
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,360
be used for Darner everything and is

838
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,970
used for darn near everything in retro

839
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:56,330
computing and always be available as a

840
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:57,770
resource always be available I can tell

841
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:01,960
you one computing community in

842
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:03,620
particular that was emphatic about

843
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,270
self-selecting developers was a

844
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,428
Commodore Amiga community if you didn't

845
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:09,160
respond to bug requests or put out new

846
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:11,390
versions of your software to fix bugs

847
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,940
you didn't have a lot of users they have

848
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:16,220
to work because they would users would

849
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,540
basically say don't use the software he

850
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,950
doesn't know what he's doing he doesn't

851
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:21,500
respond the customer service requests

852
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:25,700
and I found this bug it's crashing and

853
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:28,760
he hasn't fixed it big emphasis on good

854
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:32,059
customer service in that community so

855
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:35,240
you got to put solutions in place to

856
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:36,230
preserve security so what this means is

857
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,780
you got to make sure the entire

858
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:39,800
environment is appropriately secured and

859
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,389
if you know how do you how do you

860
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,610
environment operates you can assess and

861
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:45,950
address risk and the retro computing

862
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:47,899
community will often with emulators

863
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:50,960
describe what turnin options will do and

864
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,860
more importantly what not to do and they

865
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,410
emphasize keeping your personal

866
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:57,309
information safe and off of devices you

867
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:59,420
develop on sounds familiar

868
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:00,770
so how does this relate to modern

869
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,570
company I just talked about a bunch of

870
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:05,389
things that have gone on over the past

871
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,950
thirty years here's the first way I'm

872
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:10,520
going to bring this home for you we are

873
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:11,900
losing information more now than ever so

874
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,760
I'm gonna bring up the example of the

875
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,640
iPhone I have a thunder phille iPhone

876
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,520
here that up until iOS 11 was able to

877
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,429
run 32-bit applications it now only runs

878
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,710
64-bit application

879
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:27,499
so think of all the 32-bit applications

880
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:29,749
out there that no longer run because

881
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:31,279
apple iOS will not run them and from

882
00:33:29,749 --> 00:33:33,519
what I understand there is no emulator

883
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,710
yet for apple iOS that I'll do 32 bits

884
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,230
we generate petabytes of information a

885
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:41,090
year and I'm sure that there's you could

886
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,320
probably use exabyte at this point for

887
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:45,199
the amount of information we generate

888
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,428
and barely any of it despite the best

889
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,450
efforts of companies like Google and

890
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:52,100
Microsoft is kept in a format we can use

891
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:53,629
we didn't know we have and we need to

892
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,119
collaborate to know critical information

893
00:33:53,629 --> 00:33:58,129
about what we own and almost every

894
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:00,230
company out there has something very old

895
00:33:58,129 --> 00:34:02,529
and obsolete that is absolutely critical

896
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:05,629
to their business you're not alone

897
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:07,970
everyone's got something 20 or 30 years

898
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:09,469
old and it you shut off would cause a

899
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:12,079
serious disruption to your revenue

900
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:17,328
I don't care of your Apple Microsoft IBM

901
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:19,299
or Purdue you have something and I will

902
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:21,889
tell you message from management here

903
00:34:19,299 --> 00:34:23,389
your peers are most likely already

904
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:26,119
collaborating and they haven't told you

905
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:27,409
yet and I will tell you in terms of some

906
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:31,220
of the managers I've dealt with over the

907
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:32,540
past 20 years an IT there in some cases

908
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:35,239
there's a fear of repercussions because

909
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:40,129
some managers emphasize not talking to

910
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:40,729
outsiders and realistically if you're an

911
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:42,679
app boat

912
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:45,579
you should be providing the blocking and

913
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:48,500
tackling for these four people to

914
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:51,139
preserve your critical assets and reduce

915
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,270
risk and don't be scared of potential

916
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:55,579
impact from lawyers reverse engineering

917
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:57,200
how a 20 year old device works or that

918
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:58,700
looks like to explain the people the

919
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,279
Digital Millennium Copyright Act has

920
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:03,558
section 1201 for a reason you are

921
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,520
allowed to reverse-engineer something

922
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,250
you own for the purposes of

923
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,920
interoperability so as long as you do

924
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:14,119
that tell the lawyers that you should be

925
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:18,859
ok and nothing is so critical that you

926
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:20,630
have to absolutely hide it and the

927
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:22,250
lessons learned from this corporations

928
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:25,190
and team members need to collaborate on

929
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:27,380
shared vulnerabilities why everybody has

930
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,119
done and possess on the period we need

931
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,980
to work together to address them it's

932
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,809
about reducing risk not corporate

933
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,589
advantage and what do we learn from

934
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:37,890
wanna cry Petra and

935
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:40,950
Pecha what good is corporate advantage

936
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:44,549
if you don't have a network what good

937
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:46,229
it's no good so what you want to do is

938
00:35:44,549 --> 00:35:47,339
you want to empower your key team

939
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:49,200
members to collaborate with their peers

940
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:49,828
and you want to instead of trying to

941
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,910
hide it

942
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:52,619
we're trying to hide the fact you've got

943
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:55,700
some legacy system someplace you

944
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:58,410
facilitate it I couldn't have a major

945
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:01,348
major supplier to one of the Big Three

946
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:03,868
automakers that actually facilitates it

947
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:05,819
who and this was 20 years ago why

948
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:08,549
because most of robots that assemble

949
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:12,869
auto that assemble autos at the time

950
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:15,599
were running backs not openvms VAX an

951
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:17,549
operating system that quite frankly is

952
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,910
older than I am and he came on eight

953
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:22,529
inch disks so because of that you had a

954
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:24,868
major auto company out there that was

955
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:27,869
openly collaborating they had staff

956
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:30,349
doing that why because those 27 year old

957
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:32,069
robots at the time they shut down

958
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:35,700
there's a lot of people that weren't

959
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:37,079
really buying new cars and you want to

960
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:40,319
provide legal protection for them to do

961
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,910
so so that they can reduce risk and they

962
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:44,160
can share this information without fear

963
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,779
of repercussions you want them joining

964
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,190
information sharing an advisory centers

965
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:50,130
such as the National Health Science ACK

966
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:51,900
or in the case of Purdue the research

967
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,119
education and networking I sac red eye

968
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,729
SEC and you want to facilitate the

969
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,319
shared forums and discussion areas to

970
00:36:56,729 --> 00:37:01,799
discuss how to resolve a lot of these

971
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:04,259
issues and give them time and resources

972
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:05,609
to reverse engineer what you've got if

973
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:06,539
you have to change the acquisition rules

974
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:09,749
so be it

975
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:11,489
this is your business eBay flea markets

976
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:13,410
and Bitcoin or work the risks if it

977
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:15,299
involves keeping something safe and

978
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,759
secure on your network and I can tell

979
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,839
you in particular the supplier to the me

980
00:37:17,759 --> 00:37:21,059
to one of the big three auto

981
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:23,400
manufacturers I mentioned had three

982
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:25,710
staff members their job was to go on

983
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,039
ebay into the vintage computer forum and

984
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:30,989
buy all the deck hardware that can get

985
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,999
their hands on they would literally get

986
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:34,859
lists from their IT department what to

987
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:39,419
buy and they would their job was to go

988
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:41,609
on eBay and buy it and also don't do

989
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,319
this in isolation have them gather its

990
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:45,150
information and knowledge as part of the

991
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:46,739
yearly risk assessments and include

992
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,869
addressing discovered risks as part of

993
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:50,490
the risk management plan

994
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:52,200
because you have to do so from the point

995
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:54,359
of view of addressing the risk in real

996
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,980
life use cases and don't get caught up

997
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,910
in these point solutions that say hey do

998
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,040
you put this on you network you'll

999
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:01,160
preserve all your legacy devices why

1000
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,480
can't you well it's not gonna do it and

1001
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:07,080
you have because the reason the real

1002
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,280
reason we have all of the legislation

1003
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,069
out there on the information security

1004
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,290
why we have HIPPA why we have high tech

1005
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:15,900
is because and why we have the rules in

1006
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:17,520
finance and why the FFIEC has the rules

1007
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,800
they do is because you have to know what

1008
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,170
you have address what you have and treat

1009
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,000
these resources like they have the 20 or

1010
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,430
30 year lifecycle they do you have to

1011
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,960
mitigate risk and you have to make sure

1012
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:30,960
your use cases address present and

1013
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,490
future conditions translation if they

1014
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,660
decide that they're gonna run a skeleton

1015
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,520
crew at your factory and they're going

1016
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:38,520
to monitor everything over the internet

1017
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:42,150
from Kalamazoo Michigan they need to be

1018
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,410
able to do so and do so securely and you

1019
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:47,070
got to address these risks with common

1020
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:49,020
solutions so level set for a lot of

1021
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:50,640
people here don't put this off because

1022
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:53,310
it doesn't meet someone's criteria for

1023
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,740
an ideal solution oftentimes an IT we

1024
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:57,660
get into this mindset of we have to get

1025
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:59,819
the perfect solution out there it has to

1026
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,980
do everything that doesn't work that way

1027
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,440
you don't have something to secure your

1028
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,520
systems now and you're at risk and the

1029
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,190
reason why you're at risk is because

1030
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,680
you've you're sitting there in analysis

1031
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:12,359
paralysis and you like many other

1032
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,310
companies you don't have a butter to put

1033
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:15,930
all new solutions in and you shouldn't

1034
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:18,509
try to play keep up with the Joneses so

1035
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:20,310
translation many of the magazines you

1036
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:22,920
read out there many of the publications

1037
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:24,330
they make their money off of advertising

1038
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,369
revenue trying to get you to buy the

1039
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:28,950
latest and greatest products you

1040
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:31,200
shouldn't fall into that trap you want

1041
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:33,779
to keep the solutions common low cost

1042
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,850
and easily replaceable or fixable in

1043
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,350
case of failure so in other words you

1044
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,790
collaborate with others I'm building and

1045
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:41,310
maintaining them and keep them simple

1046
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:42,840
and add it away so if you don't think

1047
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:44,640
that something like this works take a

1048
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,900
look at the Open Compute Project where

1049
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,759
you have some of the largest cloud

1050
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,380
services and application providers on

1051
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,420
the internet collaborating on server

1052
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,830
designs twenty years ago it would have

1053
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,359
been unthinkable it also would have been

1054
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:56,160
a major dent in the revenue stream with

1055
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:58,850
a lot of former multi-billion dollar

1056
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,450
companies and I want to emphasize that

1057
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:02,700
former multi

1058
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:04,799
billion-dollar companies the companies

1059
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,598
you deal with now for server technology

1060
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,980
and compute technology are not most

1061
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,530
likely not going to be here in 20 years

1062
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:14,220
and the forum you recognize outside of

1063
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:17,089
maybe IBM and even then half of what was

1064
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:21,419
IBM 20 years ago now belongs to Lenovo

1065
00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:22,828
hewlett-packard 20 years ago there were

1066
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,550
four other companies that were part of

1067
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:25,920
hewlett-packard

1068
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:28,980
the Hewlett Packard Enterprise I believe

1069
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,869
the new one ZTE there was also agile

1070
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:34,829
--nt and about two other companies that

1071
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:37,260
got spun off so change is inevitable and

1072
00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:39,060
you have to make sure you're as open as

1073
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,040
possible and flexible as possible as

1074
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:44,730
simple as possible because 20 years from

1075
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,550
now those companies are most likely not

1076
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:50,310
going to exist so keep things as simple

1077
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:53,070
keep it matter to weigh and collaborate

1078
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:55,230
and documents so how does this actually

1079
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:57,480
benefit you you actually address your

1080
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:59,310
risks based on your use cases and you

1081
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,530
put solutions in place that actually are

1082
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:02,759
provably secure in a combination with

1083
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:05,069
network based security such as

1084
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,160
segmentation a light amount manage

1085
00:41:05,069 --> 00:41:09,779
multiple sites securely so think of some

1086
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,129
benefits I listed here such as central

1087
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,619
medical device or clinical engineering

1088
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:15,900
command centers that's something you're

1089
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:17,520
hearing a lot about these days why

1090
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,800
because a couple of major hospitals

1091
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,470
pulled it off executives see that and go

1092
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,230
ooh I want that because it helps me

1093
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:27,930
increase my revenue so you have to be

1094
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:30,530
prepared and you think about centralized

1095
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:32,730
SCADA management for industrial devices

1096
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:34,200
think of the fact that there's a lot of

1097
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:35,250
factories out there but the people that

1098
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,589
actually know how to maintain that

1099
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:40,170
equipment are few and far between so you

1100
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:43,440
put the monitoring equipment where the

1101
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:45,690
people are at and you literally run VPN

1102
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,150
connections from where the people are at

1103
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:49,680
to those machines keep keep a tech or

1104
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,660
two on site to fix the stuff when the

1105
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,279
when it breaks but again you're have

1106
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:55,740
people monitoring industrial equipment

1107
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,599
three states away and when I did my

1108
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:00,029
research to his presentation I went to

1109
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,190
guy named Bill heard he's a Hoosier

1110
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:03,690
he should be mentioned as much as SWA's

1111
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:06,480
niak is why because he's designed the

1112
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:08,339
Commodore 128 he designed the computer

1113
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,640
that in the mid-80s had three processors

1114
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:12,960
in it that was doing work that quite

1115
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,930
frankly no one else in the market was

1116
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,550
doing

1117
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:17,230
and he comes to me when I talked about

1118
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:21,130
the silver email he goes to me he goes

1119
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:23,500
you know Mitch we put this equipment out

1120
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:27,280
there we were just figuring out how it

1121
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,630
worked so now we have equipment designed

1122
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,090
when people were figuring out how

1123
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:32,710
networking works heck even with micro

1124
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,360
processors work and you're putting it on

1125
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:36,010
the Internet so it's the equivalent of

1126
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,320
putting a jet engine and Model T in so

1127
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:40,150
in many cases so that's part of the

1128
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:44,560
reason we have to be so careful in

1129
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:46,600
assessing our risk and we have to do so

1130
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,310
in a way to preserve the experience

1131
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,020
because there's no way in heck you're

1132
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:53,170
gonna make something running a processor

1133
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:54,190
from 1979 like the 68000 you're not

1134
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,660
gonna make it run a modern user

1135
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:57,810
interface it's not wearing a networking

1136
00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:00,100
stack you got to think differently and

1137
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:02,020
keep that user experience and keep any

1138
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,700
changes out of the way you don't

1139
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,620
introduce new challenges of not needed

1140
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,490
and more importantly you make us that a

1141
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,529
person that's been operating that

1142
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:10,899
machine for the past 30 years is able to

1143
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:11,980
do so without major changes or else

1144
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:16,330
you're gonna have some employee

1145
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:18,160
engagement issues so I wish I had the

1146
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:20,590
old Commodore demo thing I could have

1147
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,960
put up here but I wanna do thanks to

1148
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:26,170
Bill herd designer of the Commodore 128

1149
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,810
in +4 and fellow Hoosier John Haeger hi

1150
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:30,940
Ken petit and Stephen Adolph of club 100

1151
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:33,370
having complaints of the vintage

1152
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,230
computer Federation Alex or Bella's from

1153
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:39,009
Blackstone Law Group and 2600 magazine

1154
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:41,470
and the crew from Pouncy 64 on IRC EF

1155
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:45,000
nets so thank you all very much

1156
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:45,000
well before to any questions

1157
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:04,660
everyone was applauding it working what

1158
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,880
do you see

1159
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:08,259
technologically it's gonna relieve some

1160
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,480
of those problems that are just kind of

1161
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,100
like piling on right now if anything I

1162
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,540
think you have to have a good risk

1163
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:16,299
management plan I'm very familiar with

1164
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:17,860
the man who spoke here actually talked

1165
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,800
to one of his friends on a regular basis

1166
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,540
from Eskenazi so we actually collaborate

1167
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,410
with them pretty extensively so just a

1168
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,930
little bit of level setting in

1169
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:27,190
backgrounds ultimately you have to

1170
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:29,020
extend your risk management program the

1171
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:31,180
medical devices and you are gonna have

1172
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:34,150
to put these devices off in your own

1173
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:37,089
little worlds a lot of medical devices

1174
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:39,160
out there again I can name devices from

1175
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:40,690
multi-billion dollar companies that have

1176
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,710
networking abilities because somebody

1177
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:44,680
figured out how to make a serial to

1178
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:46,330
Ethernet ships at work you have to keep

1179
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,370
all of that in mind you have to assess

1180
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:50,740
your risk properly you also have to

1181
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:53,980
realize that there's no way I can expect

1182
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:55,839
the company to update these devices

1183
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:56,290
after five years it's just not gonna

1184
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,490
happen

1185
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,720
half the time they're kidding get the

1186
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:00,459
built they can't even get the builds

1187
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,480
building a software working directly

1188
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:05,530
which is why I mentioned it today in

1189
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:07,480
retrocomputing literally if I were to

1190
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:09,430
tell you I want to build a pomalyst 3.5

1191
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,980
application today I wouldn't know where

1192
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:14,230
to start because even getting the

1193
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,340
software needed to build it running on a

1194
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:17,230
modern operating system would be a

1195
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:20,620
challenge that's the problem you have a

1196
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:23,290
medical device security is because a lot

1197
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:25,990
of this hardware and software that has a

1198
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:29,080
stated 10-year life cycle you're not

1199
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:30,759
patching it on Patch Tuesday and why the

1200
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,560
heck should it be visible in to anyone

1201
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,450
for any purpose other than what it needs

1202
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,759
and according to HIPAA Security Rule it

1203
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:39,220
shouldn't be this full only be there for

1204
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,330
the purpose that's needed for so yes

1205
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:42,730
we're gonna see you a medical device

1206
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:43,840
security that people are going to figure

1207
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:45,040
out the hard way don't have to segment

1208
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,450
this stuff off from the rest of your

1209
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,279
network and they're gonna have to keep

1210
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:49,990
it isolated and know their data flows

1211
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,480
which is ultimately be a mat a HIPAA

1212
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:53,799
Security Rule in the first place and I

1213
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,190
applaud the work that man is doing at

1214
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,190
Eskenazi

1215
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:02,049
it's I'm just curious with your passion

1216
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:03,759
in the retro computing area obviously

1217
00:46:02,049 --> 00:46:07,559
you're very passionate about having been

1218
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:10,720
able to apply that in your day job

1219
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:13,660
I haven't been able to apply it at IU

1220
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,730
Health but I will tell you in previous

1221
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:17,440
jobs I've run into hardware and software

1222
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:20,440
that has been so old no one else has

1223
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:23,380
known how to operate it I have been able

1224
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,839
to use serial ports and actually

1225
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:27,670
configure one which is lost arts I have

1226
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:30,759
actually had to do it for a fire alarm

1227
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:33,130
system my whole job because a fire alarm

1228
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,710
system was sending out serial ports and

1229
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:38,680
sending out signals out of what's called

1230
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:40,270
an odd baud rates and getting anyone to

1231
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:43,240
understand serial port as anything other

1232
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:44,829
9600 baud is a bit of a challenge these

1233
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,379
days so yes I have applied this

1234
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:52,390
repeatedly at my job just not an IU

1235
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:57,960
Health so any other questions from the

1236
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:57,960
audience there thank you

1237
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,580
you
