1
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,030
okay let's get started tonight it's my

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,160
pleasure to introduce Brian Lynch who's

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,350
a consultant with Eli Lilly in his area

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,448
is in threat intelligence he's part of a

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,550
team there that works on that he's been

6
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:23,200
at the company for 16 years and he's

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,790
held various roles within security

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,140
including manufacturing security

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,299
vulnerability management threat

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,369
management and most recently threat

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,619
intelligence where he where he works

12
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:34,180
today he has a bachelor's degree in

13
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,789
management information systems and a

14
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:40,059
master's from masters in information

15
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:41,559
communication Sciences and he is

16
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:43,809
certified in a number of different ways

17
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:46,059
and he's going to share his experiences

18
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:51,699
with us and Eli Lilly on threat

19
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:57,190
intelligence thank you can assume is

20
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:57,818
this on projecting all right well thanks

21
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,729
for having me guys

22
00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:02,829
as he said he kind of did my intro for

23
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:06,908
me from the slides we're gonna talk

24
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:08,530
through this is a talk I gave at the NH

25
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:12,280
I sac which stands for national

26
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:15,100
healthcare I sac back in November so

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,990
just a couple months ago tried to modify

28
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,259
it a little bit so I'll be AB loading a

29
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,729
little in the middle of this but for the

30
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:23,170
most part what I hope you're going to

31
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:24,640
get out of here we'll get to agenda

32
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,859
slide in a minute but is that you'll

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,240
walk away not only understanding a

34
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:30,039
little bit about what for intelligence

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,469
is but kind of seeing how it's

36
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:34,359
implemented in a company so you know we

37
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:35,559
could go to Google and look up different

38
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:37,479
things about threat intelligence but

39
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,560
hopefully you'll walk away with what it

40
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,950
kind of looks like being it being

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,479
implemented Atta had a large company so

42
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,340
that being said he introduced me a

43
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:49,090
little bit here I mentioned I'm 16 years

44
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:51,670
of Lilly my husband married for 15 years

45
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:56,320
I got an 11 year old son his baseball

46
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:58,869
coach loved to exercise and workout and

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,309
love the Lord 15 years and I'm a high

48
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,229
school youth group leader so I'm happy

49
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,960
to be on campus so I'm gonna get visit a

50
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:08,139
few of my students that have come up

51
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,669
here to be a school produce so and then

52
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,799
ways to get hold of me the best way is

53
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:13,510
definitely my email I have the Twitter

54
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,840
handle I don't use it nearly as often as

55
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,000
I should and it could look kind of

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,530
conceited to

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,240
be risk master and the field of

58
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,860
information security but I can assure

59
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,750
you that what that really is is around

60
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,700
the board game risk if you guys we heard

61
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,100
that and me and my family play that a

62
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,119
lot and they're they get beat a lot so

63
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,350
that's where that comes from

64
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,450
so I mentioned the agenda we're just

65
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,459
going to kind of go through the creation

66
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,958
our ti team around people process

67
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,490
technology what the future looks like

68
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,980
and hopefully leave plenty of time for

69
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,780
questions and answers you'll see the

70
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,600
wild e coyote and the roadrunner up

71
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,160
there and and then also the threat

72
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,040
intelligence lifecycle in there and so

73
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,420
that is a I thought this was pretty

74
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,070
apical because if you know the

75
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,119
roadrunner or that know the coyote he's

76
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,680
always trying to get the roadrunner

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,800
really never ever catches him and he's

78
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,660
always having to retool replan and keep

79
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,160
trying to execute right and so for

80
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,930
intelligence not a lot different there's

81
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,850
this never-ending right you there's

82
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,050
always changes in AB series and whatnot

83
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:16,200
so that's the theme of the slides and

84
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,330
then as always want to do these these

85
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,579
these views are my own and out it

86
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:25,950
necessarily of my company and this was

87
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,180
again the nhi sax audience but not

88
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,040
necessarily a super technical

89
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,900
presentation and that's where the coyote

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,190
leaving the screen was for all the super

91
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,209
technical people to leave so they

92
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,709
wouldn't pepper me with a bunch of

93
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:42,330
questions and make me feel stupid

94
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:43,590
so so jumping into it before I talk

95
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,940
about threat intelligence I'll tell you

96
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,540
where I where I came from and what Lilly

97
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,859
looked like before we before we did that

98
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,179
and actually I jumped ahead I skipped

99
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,260
the first ball in my slide this is when

100
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,120
I added so sorry

101
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,790
so threat intelligence what is threat

102
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,200
intelligence I thought I would would do

103
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,459
a definition of that and so what we

104
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,970
believe that to be is analyzed

105
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,350
information about hostile intent

106
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,900
capability and opportunity of an

107
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,299
adversary so it's very much focused on

108
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,400
the human and not focused on

109
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,840
vulnerability so we have a we have a

110
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,340
vulnerability management apartment too

111
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,930
and a lot of times threat intelligence

112
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,750
and vulnerability management can get

113
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:21,660
mixed up and really vulnerabilities are

114
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,300
away that adversaries can use and

115
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,440
exploit threats but threats but

116
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,240
vulnerabilities by themself or not

117
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,840
threats so that's kind of what we deem

118
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,040
to be threat intelligence

119
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,780
and so now we'll go into so prior to

120
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,820
having a threat intelligence program at

121
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,380
Lille we were we had what we would call

122
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,860
our instant response team our Sauk

123
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,909
Security Operations Center and as a part

124
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,550
of that there is a threat management

125
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,840
function and myself and one other

126
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,240
colleague who's now on the threat

127
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,739
intelligence team we were that function

128
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,990
and we had several different roles in

129
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,850
there we were kind of in-between between

130
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,710
our tier one folks there was eyes on

131
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,940
glass looking at incidents and they

132
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,489
would send stuff to us they thought were

133
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,780
incidents but we would make sure we

134
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,000
really thought they were kind of weed

135
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,280
out the false positives before we push

136
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,110
them up we also had to manage the vendor

137
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,760
and we had to do SL leis and metrics and

138
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,120
different things like that and so I tell

139
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,380
you all that to say we were we were

140
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,330
supposed to do threat intelligence in

141
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,010
that role it was one of our titles but a

142
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,599
lot of times at big companies you know

143
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,130
you have a whole bunch of stuff to do

144
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,330
and you just gotta prioritize and so

145
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,800
threat intelligence just kept getting

146
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:28,280
prioritized at the bottom and we just

147
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,440
didn't do it so we got to the point

148
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,179
where we really need a dedicated team

149
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,700
and so that's around the third piece on

150
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,229
my on my slides here which is why do you

151
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,020
need a dedicated team and so these are

152
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:41,090
some of the reasons very much threat

153
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,740
intelligence as external visibility

154
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,119
what's going on outside of your company

155
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,010
trying to come in what's what's

156
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,200
attacking your your company what's

157
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:51,740
attacking your sector like Pharma or

158
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,750
healthcare we wanted to understand the

159
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,610
threat better what threats are there to

160
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,940
us we didn't really understand who might

161
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:01,220
be interested in attacking us we wanted

162
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,860
to get to an intelligence driven model

163
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,440
for security and wanted that to threat

164
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,870
intelligence to play a role into that

165
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,880
and a couple of the other bullet points

166
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,740
on there around IO CES and understanding

167
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,250
apts advanced persistent threats and

168
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,960
things like that so so I mentioned that

169
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,120
the threat management's goal was to

170
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,370
really weed out false positives really

171
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,620
and make sure we get things up there so

172
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,440
kind of the primary if I had to sum

173
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,220
about the primary purpose of of Ti is

174
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:34,880
we're trying to form our business of

175
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:36,800
threats and risks around a round art

176
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,090
around our business so that's that's

177
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,330
kind of how I would sum up all those

178
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,799
bullet points and then this is where

179
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,099
I've thrown in a few extra things yeah

180
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,099
go ahead

181
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,980
absolutely yes great question that is

182
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,900
very much one of the things so it's back

183
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,790
to that that risk driven intelligence

184
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,880
driven program so for the vulnerability

185
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,770
side we if we find a very critical

186
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,870
threat out there that's exploiting a

187
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,150
vulnerability to make that threat be

188
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,560
realized yes our our vulnerability team

189
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,169
can add that too they have a kind of a

190
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,930
top ten scanning list and they can add

191
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:31,930
that to their list feel free

192
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:05,580
that is a much tougher question also a

193
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,649
good one right now I would say and you

194
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,969
know so some of my Lilly collegues are

195
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:10,619
in the corner and they're gonna think

196
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:12,959
introduce yourself sort of the end or at

197
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:15,389
the end but right now we don't do a

198
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,179
super great job of metrics tracking and

199
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:19,709
so dwell time and and reduce all those

200
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:22,589
different things it would be hard for us

201
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:24,209
to say definitively that our programs

202
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:25,769
doing that I would say that I would like

203
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:28,709
to say we are we just have a hard time

204
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:34,318
quantifying it right now I think would

205
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:35,549
be a fair answer to that let's see so so

206
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:38,759
a couple things I wanted to throw in

207
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:41,458
here on this just so what what I think

208
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,949
makes threat intelligence valuable to a

209
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,569
company and to me it's a lot like goal

210
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:46,829
setting probable setting and you know

211
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:49,019
they need to be realistic and they need

212
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:50,849
to be timely and whatnot and so what I

213
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,540
what I found what I believe is they need

214
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,920
to be accurate and timely and relevant

215
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,040
tailored to your audience to your to

216
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,139
organization to our to arch you know

217
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,779
industry predictive it's a big part of

218
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,610
threat intelligence we get asked a lot

219
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:07,439
right you know what how does this threat

220
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,910
affect us where could it affect us why

221
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:11,129
would they go use this threatened so

222
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,089
predictive and then actionable so those

223
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:13,620
are some of the things I think are

224
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:17,670
valuable threat intelligence

225
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,899
characteristics and then an important

226
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,860
thing for threat intelligence program to

227
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,910
do is to show value and sometimes that's

228
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,319
hard because I think if their

229
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,899
intelligence kind of like insurance

230
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:29,939
right and so it's kind of timely because

231
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,319
I just got my year-end report for my

232
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:33,209
from my credit card statement where I

233
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:34,559
put a lot of my stuff and I saw that I

234
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:36,859
spent thirty three hundred dollars on

235
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,180
insurance this year which was like wow

236
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,189
having a hard time finding the value in

237
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,839
that so but that's where threat Intel

238
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:44,040
comes in there too is that we got to be

239
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,360
able to find that show that value

240
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,349
someone that's in the metrics so I said

241
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,360
we're gonna get to but so four things I

242
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,889
put down that I think show value of a

243
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,559
threat Intel program which is to produce

244
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:58,800
Intel products for a wide variety people

245
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:00,809
including your executives using your

246
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,149
approach your Intel to drive your

247
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,829
project portfolio so help prioritize

248
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:07,170
which projects are more important or

249
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:08,729
another so you mentioned vulnerabilities

250
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,939
but you also do projects right what tool

251
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,349
needs to be implemented

252
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:13,118
more quickly because of the threats were

253
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:15,519
seeing

254
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:17,789
I had to decrease dwell time metrics and

255
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,499
other metrics to your question and then

256
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:22,689
cost avoidance and so that one's huge

257
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:24,849
because it's hard to communicate that

258
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:26,228
but for us so take not pitch it for

259
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:28,329
instance and you guys are probably read

260
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:29,799
when Merck got hit with that right there

261
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:31,478
are fellow pharmaceutical company with

262
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,649
us and I think they've reported

263
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:35,259
somewhere in they were have four hundred

264
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:37,599
million dollar loss right and then also

265
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,829
I cannot server say their name right so

266
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:41,649
I'll just say the shipping company they

267
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:44,409
got hit as well they were like 350

268
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:46,629
million dollars lost and so being able

269
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:48,399
to communicate that hey that was an

270
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:50,049
attack very much that could have hit us

271
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,819
and it didn't through our through our

272
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,439
some of our efforts our tools so that's

273
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:56,848
how where we can demonstrate some value

274
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:59,559
out of Ti and security as a whole really

275
00:10:56,849 --> 00:11:02,619
so moving on so we're going to talk a

276
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:04,569
little bit on the slide about how we got

277
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:06,519
to a TI program and then we're going to

278
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:10,598
talk about people process technology and

279
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,919
so again I would just highlight you guys

280
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:13,029
have probably heard through undergrad

281
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,359
and whatnot you know when you're getting

282
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:17,919
to come the management sponsorship is

283
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:20,649
key right you got to have sponsorship to

284
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,929
really drive anything across the company

285
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,659
and so to create a TI program was no

286
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:27,039
different and so our C so found salt the

287
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:29,649
value with some of the stuff already

288
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,269
talked about we needed a TI program she

289
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:32,829
didn't really have the expertise to

290
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,539
build it and we didn't really have it

291
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:37,149
inside so what we did is we went out and

292
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:38,889
we bought it we we hired a pretty

293
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:40,959
high-level person from another company

294
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:42,369
that reported directly to our C so who

295
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,638
has who had threat intelligence

296
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:49,179
experience and and came in with that

297
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,829
mindset to build it and then of course

298
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:52,569
we had to show that value pretty fast

299
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:54,399
right so we started producing Intel

300
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:55,839
reports was what we could do right away

301
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,489
to start showing that value to keep that

302
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,449
management sponsorship to kind of gain

303
00:11:57,489 --> 00:12:04,329
the to grow the team and then I guess I

304
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:06,549
would just say what we did because it

305
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:08,108
could be hard to get to a point where

306
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:11,019
you're ever like we're ready for threat

307
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:12,699
intelligence were 100% ready so we went

308
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:14,259
at it at risk is what we like to call it

309
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,769
and we started doing threat intelligence

310
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:19,269
before even having a team ready

311
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,709
really so we lifted and shifted and I

312
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:22,419
mentioned myself and another colleague

313
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:23,439
that was in threat management we just

314
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:25,420
basically moved over

315
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,829
started doing threat intelligence and

316
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,128
we're gonna talk about that more I think

317
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:32,349
on the next slide

318
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:33,879
so the build out of the team and the

319
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,319
people piece so the coyote here he's

320
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,759
looking a little dazed and confused

321
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:38,829
because when and that's pretty much how

322
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:40,870
my colleague and I felt but you got all

323
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:43,479
this stuff you got you got executive

324
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,550
briefs and you got attacker TTP's and

325
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,899
sharing of threat intelligence and all

326
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,060
these different things coming at you how

327
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:52,000
are you gonna hunt and all these things

328
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,560
that make up TI and and you got to Lily

329
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,910
people they got a lot of experience at

330
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,349
Lily and kind of know our environment

331
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,839
they don't know how to do Ti so what we

332
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,060
did and I think it was a great resource

333
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:04,300
mix for us is that we went out hired two

334
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,069
external people out out and brought him

335
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,050
in that had Ti experience one of them

336
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:09,339
came from a whole different industry

337
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,758
sector than us so brought a different

338
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:14,680
skew to us to perspective to us in

339
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,420
pharmaceutical and another guy we got

340
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,160
out of the Army and that's what he did a

341
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,370
full time was threat intelligence from

342
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,560
an from an army standpoint and so those

343
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,420
two guys coming in was really helpful

344
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,949
and so as you guys can imagine if we had

345
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,479
had for Lily people trying to do this

346
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:30,459
and just learn a threat intelligence I'd

347
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,529
have been much slower and if we had had

348
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:34,029
for external people that knew a bunch

349
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:35,740
about their intelligence but couldn't

350
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:38,560
apply it to the lily environment and

351
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,120
what systems and tools and procedures we

352
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,680
had in place that would have been a lot

353
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,980
harder to put in place so I think that

354
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,269
resource mix was really good and then

355
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,829
other things we're doing around people

356
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:50,740
not only in threat intelligence but in

357
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:52,420
security altogether is that we we let

358
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,180
our all of our people go to a training

359
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,969
every year we're a big sand shot so

360
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,560
sands training and so we do a training

361
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,449
every year and get certified if we

362
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,910
choose in that we also get to go to a

363
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:05,319
conference or more usually in that

364
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,029
because a lot of times the conference is

365
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:08,519
like nhi sac are pretty cheap and so

366
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:12,430
they don't really cost too much to go to

367
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,889
we we're celebrating a lot of times lily

368
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,269
and big companies you know

369
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:17,949
certifications kind of go by the wayside

370
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:20,170
but in security we're really celebrating

371
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:22,809
that and rewarding and recognizing

372
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,420
people and I get new certs and we do

373
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:27,189
several things where we try to get in

374
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,500
front of people I share so kind of like

375
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:31,870
this we we do at internal we have some

376
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,699
quarterly sessions and monthly sessions

377
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,649
where we can come and present stuff that

378
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:37,030
we've learned at conferences so that's

379
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:41,410
some of what we down around the peep

380
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:43,750
sign so we'll move on to the process and

381
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,640
this is a very busy slide and I'm gonna

382
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,060
touch on pieces of this throughout this

383
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,020
got a lot of notes behind the scene here

384
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,369
but over on the left hand side it's

385
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,040
those same things threat intelligence

386
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,810
feeds and and sources and threat honey

387
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,939
and all those things you got to do has a

388
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,859
threat analyst and then everything on

389
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,720
the right is all of your outputs except

390
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,400
for the legal privacy partnership so you

391
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,030
got you've got some other factors in

392
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,890
your company

393
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,699
that you that you have to weigh in when

394
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,800
it comes to doing threat intelligence

395
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,360
and then you got all the rest ooh you're

396
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,829
gonna report to what kind of reports

397
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,930
you're gonna do how you're going to

398
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,810
share so that's kind of walking you

399
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:19,329
through that slide so when we first

400
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,609
started doing this I mentioned we needed

401
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:24,010
to do provide some values so we started

402
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,120
doing reporting and there's different

403
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:28,120
types of reporting a threat intelligence

404
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,740
so you can have a flash report so wanna

405
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,450
cry and not pet you over one of those

406
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,950
right so when those came through those

407
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,210
were very big deals and we had to start

408
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,760
working I was immediately and we need to

409
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,140
inform our org what was going on so

410
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:42,550
those are flash reports need to get out

411
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:45,220
very quickly we also have RFI's request

412
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:47,859
for informations reports and so what

413
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,360
those are are not urgent requests that

414
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,120
people might want to bring into our team

415
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,080
and we can respond to those and do time

416
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,339
as it allows and we get those back out

417
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,560
one of the main products we do is a

418
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:01,540
weekly threat Intel report that goes out

419
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,400
to our whole security team and a little

420
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,280
bit broader audience at this point and

421
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,959
it's basically the TI team taking all

422
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,569
the threats over the last week trying to

423
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,220
get to six to ten that are most

424
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,630
applicable that we think the company

425
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,850
needs to know about and we send that out

426
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,710
with with some analysis and whatnot to

427
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,170
drive some action and drive some

428
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,730
awareness and then we also do some

429
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,069
quarterly and annually reporting so

430
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,440
quarterly we roll up the top threats for

431
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,940
the quarter annually can also be end of

432
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,640
the year what were our top threats but

433
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,140
also a predictive report where when we

434
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,860
just went through that exercise for 2018

435
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:37,089
where we were trying to predict with

436
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,730
some help of our you know intelligence

437
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:43,210
reading what we think the threats are

438
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:46,270
going to be for this year so so that was

439
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:50,320
that was our reporting stuff we also

440
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:50,890
have again you get something like one a

441
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,420
cry not

442
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,800
we didn't really have a process in place

443
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,910
for how we're gonna come together as a

444
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,030
team and work because you can imagine

445
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,589
that that went across many areas so our

446
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,360
security engineering function or a

447
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:03,160
vulnerability management and our instant

448
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,720
response folks all these people had to

449
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,490
come together we didn't really have a

450
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,440
process so now we have what we call a

451
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,210
proactive threat management process and

452
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,070
that's where we come together and

453
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:14,680
foreign intelligence comes in and

454
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,510
provides what what's the what's what's

455
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,030
the threat you know what are the actors

456
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:21,099
doing is it actively being exploited in

457
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,470
the wild or is it just proof of concept

458
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:24,909
code or you know you provide that and

459
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,460
vulnerability management comes in we'll

460
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,320
give updates on how well patch we are on

461
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,870
any known vulnerabilities relating to it

462
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,909
ir will come in and talk through us any

463
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:36,120
any instances we're seeing in our

464
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:56,920
network and what we're doing about it

465
00:17:36,120 --> 00:18:01,750
question yeah I could sounds like I can

466
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:04,300
hear him so who makes the call on what

467
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:08,700
the patch was that the question sorry

468
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:11,190
for summarize intelligence report on

469
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,700
what old abilities are gonna be patched

470
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,720
what new tools might be purchased given

471
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,130
threats that are now coming over the

472
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,340
ocean or wherever they come from gosh

473
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,840
you got you okay around FAFSA so a

474
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,129
management a lot of times those if

475
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,899
something has to be patched quickly

476
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,250
it'll fall on that PTM process I was

477
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,010
just talking about and that's what that

478
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,960
team as a team those three areas kind of

479
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,310
come together and get to a group

480
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,830
decision and that goes up to our

481
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,360
management and our management ultimately

482
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,340
makes that call and then contacts

483
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,928
management over

484
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,689
our infrastructure areas to do the

485
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:45,150
patching when it comes to our projects

486
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,289
that's still a work in progress but

487
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,390
that's a tie in to our risk management

488
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:50,400
function so they have what we call it

489
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,289
like a risk registry where where all of

490
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,770
our different risks are out there and

491
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:57,809
our projects ideally will all kind of

492
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,370
relate it to this risk registry and so

493
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:01,139
that's how projects could be prioritized

494
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:05,719
and so that's how the call will be made

495
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,720
on those does that address your question

496
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:16,620
hey Co you Paul your time okay great

497
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:18,419
let's see so I want to talk about our

498
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,129
reporting because this was something I

499
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:22,320
got a lot of feedback on at the nhi sac

500
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,820
and so from a threat intelligence

501
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,379
standpoint when it comes to these flash

502
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,210
reports and an octet you don't want to

503
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,770
cry those were big wins for threat

504
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,320
intelligence at Lilly because what we

505
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:34,289
decided to do as a team is we decided to

506
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:37,139
produce reports quickly very quickly in

507
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:39,480
the absence of them needing to be even

508
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,500
80% correct and so I got a lot of

509
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,549
feedback afterwards where people are

510
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,620
saying oh so you're just pushing out

511
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:45,029
crap right and that that's not true

512
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,860
right so we're still trying to do the

513
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:49,320
best we can but what we don't want to do

514
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,240
is be super behind and everybody else in

515
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,590
the org already making decisions before

516
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,620
they hear from threat intelligence

517
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:57,990
so there's specifically and want to cry

518
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,120
we produced threat intelligence like

519
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,340
eight hours prior to getting anything

520
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,168
from our commercial feed vendors and in

521
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,699
the end that first report our first

522
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:09,149
report compared their first report was

523
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,429
way more accurate and so that was a big

524
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:13,110
win for us and and it's not slamming

525
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:14,460
commercial feed providers was they for

526
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,320
they provide a lot of value to us too

527
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,490
but they definitely have to be slower

528
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,110
because they need to be more accurate

529
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,000
they got to be more on the accurate side

530
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:23,459
than speed and they have to balance it

531
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,720
too but so that's what we do if we find

532
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,600
that very valuable for the org

533
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,710
I think the organ Joe is that and so

534
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,969
then you might be asking if we're not

535
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,770
getting our data from threatened feed

536
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,299
and providers where do we get it and so

537
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:36,179
this is where our partnership with nhi

538
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:38,970
sac is super cool is there's a tool

539
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:42,270
called or a forum called we secrets and

540
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,429
so it's a it's a basically a chat window

541
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:47,280
really and all the different members of

542
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:49,169
anti sac are in there and take not petia

543
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,120
so Merck people were out there and when

544
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:51,640
they figured out how they got attacked

545
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,320
where

546
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,870
came in they were out there freely

547
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,929
sharing that and it was super valuable

548
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:00,669
to us maybe kept us from being being hit

549
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,910
with it because we were able to we had

550
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:05,470
similar situations in some areas and we

551
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,730
were able to go find those and close us

552
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,650
down or patch them so that was very

553
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,660
helpful so we secrets having a chat

554
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:14,910
window with external people is super big

555
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,910
and intelligence yes sir

556
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:22,360
Bob I think it was like 2015

557
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,610
maybe maybe 2016 I think is 2016 where

558
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,620
basically they made it easier for

559
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,709
corporate America to share information

560
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,330
with the government in vice versa and

561
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,940
made DHS responsible making sure that

562
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,320
the information it received was shared

563
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,360
equally and quickly among government

564
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:41,909
agencies have you seen that help within

565
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,909
the last year at all in terms of threats

566
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:51,669
um I would say I don't I haven't seen a

567
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:53,140
difference no okay in that yeah it's

568
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,850
just my opinion maybe other people might

569
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,830
think differently but for what who we

570
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,800
partner with and how we share I didn't

571
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:01,929
really see any difference in that so

572
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:05,350
okay would be my answer to that let's

573
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:09,580
see there for a big piece on here so

574
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:13,330
this is around the the legal partnership

575
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:14,199
so so I would say that all legal

576
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,120
departments are pretty conservative

577
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,280
legal apartment Lilly is probably more

578
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,889
conservative than others you know we're

579
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,000
heavily regulated by FDA and so we got

580
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,160
to be really careful about what we do

581
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,600
what we share and so you know there's

582
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,580
there's meant to be healthy tension

583
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,290
between a threat intelligence program

584
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,939
and illegal and a wall division right

585
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:33,129
because law the lawyers are trying to

586
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,780
keep us safe from being sued and harm

587
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,550
and threat intelligence is trying to

588
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,590
keep us safe from hackers right and so

589
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,110
we have two different viewpoints and we

590
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,129
gotta come together this partnership

591
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:44,830
it's easier said than done

592
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,540
but what we've decided what we think has

593
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,040
helped with that is that you have to

594
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,360
play offense right music you're not

595
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,340
playing offense you're playing defense

596
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,889
and when you're on the defensive you

597
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,500
never really get anything through and so

598
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,450
we play offense and so I was going to

599
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,100
share a couple examples of that the

600
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,370
first one is around our threat hunting

601
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,350
right so throw honey was very you know I

602
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,969
made I made our lawyers very nervous

603
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,620
and talk about throw honey so we came up

604
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,660
with a plan to go through throughout

605
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,030
hunting and we I think it was a

606
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,770
PowerPoint deck maybe a PDF but we we

607
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,970
created basically a list of things that

608
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,400
we were going to do what are we gonna

609
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:20,350
hunt log sources are we going to use

610
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,230
what types of things are we going to

611
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:25,870
look for and it made it very specific

612
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:27,910
set of things that we would hunt on and

613
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,469
also a very specific set of things when

614
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,570
we would stop hunting so like if it

615
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,910
became known or was getting very close

616
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:35,918
to know the person that was behind a

617
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,630
said thing and we would have to stop and

618
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,340
then pass it on instant response and

619
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,190
they have procedures with the lawyers on

620
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,570
how they handle that so taking that that

621
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,289
was our offensive approach we took that

622
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,059
to our lawyers

623
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:47,500
it wasn't easy it wasn't one meeting and

624
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:48,879
we're done but we got to a point where

625
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,919
they signed off on our threat hunting

626
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,600
and now as threat intelligence people

627
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:54,280
that hunt to find some threat

628
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,740
intelligence in our network our internal

629
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,960
intelligence we know what we can do

630
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,900
without any recourse so that was super

631
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,630
big or super huge for us the other one

632
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:08,049
is around threat sharing and so it was a

633
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:09,789
similar similar situation we we were

634
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:11,559
ingesting a whole bunch of stuff getting

635
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:12,789
a lot of stuff from other people but we

636
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:14,200
weren't sharing anything we're told we

637
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:16,690
couldn't share anything and so it was

638
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,010
the same kind of deal we were we created

639
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,440
a PowerPoint presentation took a

640
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:22,030
lawyer's several iterations but we were

641
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,919
telling them okay this is the type of

642
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,520
stuff that we think is green data so the

643
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:29,830
TLP

644
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:31,299
green amber red that are in white so

645
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,620
these are what we thinks why and this is

646
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:34,929
how we would share them internally and

647
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,418
externally what media we how we would

648
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:39,220
use it and if it's red and orange and so

649
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:41,429
we laid that all out and got approval

650
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,720
eventually so now as thread and telling

651
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:46,419
analysts we can we know what we can

652
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:51,820
share freely hopefully without recourse

653
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:53,049
right and so that that that is how we

654
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,549
play defense and how we got to

655
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:56,530
partnership with legal and it's a never

656
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:57,760
it's just it's cyclical just like

657
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,870
everything else you got to keep doing it

658
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,250
but but that's something that's very

659
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:06,549
important to do when you're doing a

660
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:07,900
threatened total program all right all

661
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:10,418
right we're gonna move on to technology

662
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,429
so this picture is just showing if you

663
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:14,500
just throw a bunch of Technology @ti you

664
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:16,690
can become the overwhelm analyst or the

665
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,330
coyote that's blown himself up trying to

666
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,950
chase the roadrunner

667
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:23,379
so and that's not where we want to be

668
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,799
because again all these different tools

669
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:28,630
on the right firewalls and IDS's and

670
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:30,059
VPNs DLP's you could get lost in trying

671
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:32,200
to hunt all those different logs or

672
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,519
trying to figure out how to enrich those

673
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,659
with threat intelligence and all the

674
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:38,230
different things so you got to have a

675
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:39,720
strategy around your technology so I've

676
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,679
often heard it said that

677
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,210
operationalizing threat intelligence is

678
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,470
a lot like cat herding and I would say

679
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,679
that that's probably pretty a pretty

680
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:50,559
accurate analogy so well we want to get

681
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,210
to is here where the coyote is looking

682
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,668
real cool and calm is sleek and feeling

683
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:59,320
very confident and in his abilities and

684
00:25:54,669 --> 00:26:00,370
so what we did at Lille some of the

685
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,889
things we did so when we first started

686
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:04,090
the program we you know we needed some

687
00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:05,620
help right how do we get in threat

688
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,149
intelligence we need somebody to feed

689
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,768
that to us and we didn't have a lot of

690
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:10,809
threats sharing we don't have we secrets

691
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:12,370
we don't have companies helping us so we

692
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:14,500
did a lot of open source stuff we did

693
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:17,139
have nhi sacs so they would feed us some

694
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:19,049
stuff but we also would we also had some

695
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:22,120
government stuff so we have the

696
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:23,350
InfraGard which is an FBI agency that

697
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,299
you sign up for and you get information

698
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:27,219
there's also the Indiana fusion Center

699
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:28,990
and we're members of that and we can go

700
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,519
out there and get information and then

701
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,320
there was just reading open source

702
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:34,840
articles from sans and other training

703
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,299
organizations or blogs from popular guys

704
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,559
that you guys and gals that talked about

705
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:40,779
threat intelligence that you want to

706
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,460
that you want to hear from so so that

707
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:43,659
was what it looked like initially for us

708
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,029
it's how we were gathering our threat

709
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:49,419
Intel and it was truly externally only

710
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:51,039
focused it became after a while became

711
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:52,330
okay we're basically getting tactical

712
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,980
intelligence right because threat

713
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:56,529
intelligence is broke up into tactical

714
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:59,500
operational and strategic and so

715
00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:01,360
tactical is that low-level IOC indicator

716
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,940
compromised type stuff

717
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,439
IP addresses and then you know to get an

718
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,990
operational and strategic you kind of

719
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,070
got to move up a level and so we thought

720
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,330
to get there we're never going to get

721
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,340
there on open source so we started

722
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,570
looking at threat intelligence providers

723
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,610
so I'm going to talked about them

724
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:19,629
earlier in kind of their what they do

725
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:20,799
for us so thinking through we were like

726
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,870
we didn't really know do we only need

727
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,389
one do we need three are they all gonna

728
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:26,799
repeat so we wrote some requirements

729
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:28,360
around what we think we needed our

730
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,860
provider which basically for us said hey

731
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,389
we're looking for operational and

732
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,218
strategic requirements we

733
00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:34,839
like we had tactical covered if you guys

734
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:38,079
want to throw in some tactical okay but

735
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:40,389
but we need operational strategic and we

736
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,219
and we also wanted to we wanted to

737
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:44,649
proof-of-concept them all at the same

738
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:47,229
time or close as we could so we ended up

739
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:49,178
doing five or six threat until providers

740
00:27:47,229 --> 00:27:51,039
over the course of a month and a half or

741
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:52,389
so and really just look in their data it

742
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,709
was great you did hear about a threat

743
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:55,320
you know you could punch it in all their

744
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:58,089
portals and just see what they knew and

745
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,399
and that's where we landed on we did by

746
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:01,958
to thread and tell providers and that

747
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,699
was really because one seemed very

748
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:05,049
operational focused and one was very

749
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,269
strategic and they didn't seem to

750
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:10,539
overlap a lot and so that's where we

751
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:11,799
ended up and bought two of those then

752
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:13,419
you run with that for a while so you're

753
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:15,070
getting all your emails and all your

754
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:16,329
stuff from your open source and then you

755
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,908
get all the stuff from the threatened

756
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:20,829
televisor and you again start to look

757
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:22,119
like the coyote in the last picture and

758
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:23,499
you're like man I got to do something

759
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:25,269
out this so then there's a sniff tea

760
00:28:23,499 --> 00:28:28,209
thing called the tip threat intelligence

761
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:30,039
platform and so we started looking for

762
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:32,229
that and we were like okay so what the

763
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:34,599
tips going to do for you it takes all

764
00:28:32,229 --> 00:28:36,070
these different threat Intel feeds it's

765
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:37,779
going to put them in one spot so you

766
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:41,289
have one portal login to it's going to

767
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:43,989
correlate them so you see one so if they

768
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:46,989
do duplicate they D dupe it and then you

769
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:48,279
see one article or one title and then it

770
00:28:46,989 --> 00:28:50,259
will tell you all the sources you have

771
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:51,429
coming in that reported on that which

772
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:54,279
kind of gives you a level of confidence

773
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:56,229
right so if you you're looking up

774
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:58,299
something and just some open source

775
00:28:56,229 --> 00:29:00,519
thing told you about it and none of your

776
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:02,469
premium providers and confidence is a

777
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:03,820
little lower but if you if everybody's

778
00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:05,769
told you about it it's a pretty high

779
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,899
confidence that this is a real threat

780
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:10,629
out there so that's what that's what we

781
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:12,369
did with our tip and I did want to touch

782
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:13,629
on that we did the same thing we popped

783
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:15,488
proof of concept two of those

784
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:17,349
side-by-side and we wrote up

785
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:18,989
requirements but I wanted to touch on

786
00:29:17,349 --> 00:29:21,399
the requirements because a lot of times

787
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:22,239
organizations are bad for letting and

788
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:25,418
make sure you're this right order

789
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:27,309
letting our investments our tools drive

790
00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:29,589
our requirements and that's the wrong

791
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:31,329
way to handle it and so at least we

792
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:32,529
think when it came to our tip we did it

793
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:36,759
the right way which we let our

794
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:38,200
requirements drive our investment so we

795
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:41,499
could have went out and got maybe even a

796
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:44,109
more expensive or a bigger better tip

797
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:45,130
solution that would have had 80% of

798
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:46,539
stuff we weren't ready to do

799
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:49,059
in the next two or three years because

800
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:50,679
were not that mature yet because I think

801
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:53,440
I failed to mention we're a new program

802
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,030
as of July 2016 as when we've been doing

803
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,730
threat intelligence when that program

804
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:58,960
came on so we wrote requirements to be

805
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,910
very specific to what we thought we

806
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,350
would do in the next year or two and so

807
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,690
that's how we picked our tip was based

808
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,250
on that so that was that was big for us

809
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,380
so we're not now now we're not inundated

810
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:12,370
with a whole bunch of functionality that

811
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:15,640
we can't use anyways so that's around

812
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:17,649
the technology quickly I was going to

813
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:21,700
tell you now what we hope to do from a

814
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:23,260
TI standpoint in 2018 and beyond but so

815
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,510
we've talked about the tip just finished

816
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,158
up about that and so right now we do all

817
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:30,520
I just talked about we ingest a bunch of

818
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:32,230
different feeds into it and it D dupes

819
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,700
it and it correlates this and gives us

820
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,190
some confidence but what we're not doing

821
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,650
is we're not we're not integrated with

822
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,270
any of our security tools and so like

823
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,620
our sim for instance we really need to

824
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,539
get threat intelligence data into our

825
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:48,459
sim and so that way we can right use

826
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:49,720
cases off of that or we can just enrich

827
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,370
the data that's already there with some

828
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,530
threat intelligence so that's some of

829
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:54,939
our goal is to enrich our endpoint

830
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:57,610
security tools with their intelligence

831
00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:01,419
data from our tip enrich our sim things

832
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:03,549
like that mentioned threat hunting right

833
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:05,620
now has a very manual process for us and

834
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:08,350
so we went we do believe there's

835
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,149
low-level low-hanging fruit stuff that

836
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:12,639
we should be able to automate in some

837
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:14,470
way or fashion so as a part of 2018

838
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,390
we're gonna look into threat

839
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,640
intelligence tools or threat hunting

840
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:20,950
tools that may be able to help us in

841
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,919
that area and so that we can help to

842
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:25,240
alleviate some of those some of those

843
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:26,590
daily tasks if they're hunting that they

844
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,480
can just do on their own and alert us

845
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:31,120
when they find something so that's

846
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,919
something we want to do threat modeling

847
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,379
that that's something we don't do

848
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:38,049
anything any right now just probably

849
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,190
just a resource concern just prepare

850
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:41,950
don't have the time for that it's a low

851
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:44,530
priority but there's some real value in

852
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,270
threat modeling and depending on time

853
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,860
and questions I have a backup slide I

854
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:51,010
threw out a couple of the models to show

855
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,510
you guys at the end and then additional

856
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,309
staff so I mention we have four four

857
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,710
people on our team we're all consultant

858
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:58,450
level like myself and so what we really

859
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:00,370
think would help ti

860
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:04,150
some point or another is to bring in an

861
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:05,979
entry-level person to to maybe focus on

862
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:08,020
tactical intelligence and then let a

863
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,700
couple people focus on strategic and

864
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,870
operational and kind of split the team

865
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,230
up where right now we're kind of one big

866
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:16,179
mass and and so I think it would be a

867
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,460
great thing and that's part of the

868
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,200
reason that Lily came up today is just a

869
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,180
let you guys know we have a program and

870
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,500
and and you know there's there's

871
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,060
opportunities there and their

872
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,490
intelligence and security coming you

873
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:32,379
know down the road so we so we encourage

874
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:38,410
you guys to keep us in mind yes let's

875
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:41,010
see I think that is it for there so then

876
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:43,420
to just sum up so the key takeaways

877
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:45,370
around the people side again

878
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,870
sponsorships super huge right whether

879
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,070
you're just trying to get a program in

880
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:50,229
place whether it's threat intelligence

881
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:51,820
or otherwise at a big companies you got

882
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:54,100
to get your management sponsorship on

883
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,689
board and then I talked about beat the

884
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,490
resource mixed to death but I really

885
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,980
think having external and internal

886
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:04,390
people in CI team was was very helpful

887
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:05,800
for us process we it's important to have

888
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:08,680
processes in place so that you can

889
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:10,360
handle critical threats and you can did

890
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,130
you can distinguish between how you're

891
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,209
gonna handle a threat which isn't really

892
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,860
an incident right because we have

893
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:16,570
incident processes and we were using

894
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,100
those initially and that wasn't the

895
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,870
right way to do that because they really

896
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,370
weren't incidents to us but we were just

897
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,949
trying to spin up the Wills and get

898
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:26,830
everybody working quickly so we needed a

899
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:28,540
process that was similar but but yet

900
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,429
different enough that it required its

901
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,710
own process so having having processes a

902
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:35,440
place around threat intelligence and in

903
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:37,120
things that are potential threats and

904
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,730
again at the partnership with legal

905
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,189
playing offense making sure that you're

906
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,750
going up with them and that they that

907
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:45,640
you have some way to get approval on

908
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,740
what you're gonna do and and keep that

909
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,660
conversation going and then around

910
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,100
technology had touched on again you know

911
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,140
select a tip based on your maturity

912
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,600
level really let requirements drive all

913
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,980
of your investments and then we

914
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,260
definitely organize our threat feeds

915
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,260
into tactical operational and strategic

916
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:07,510
so that being said that is where I would

917
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,310
open up for some questions and then like

918
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,619
I said I do have a final slide that it's

919
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:13,149
got some other ti specific stuff

920
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:15,190
again I know that was very process

921
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:19,989
driven button but I will go questions

922
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:23,889
first when you sit down you look at a

923
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:25,808
threat and it's you know if it's some

924
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:27,940
threats you can take care in the normal

925
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:30,940
course of business and investment other

926
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,099
threats especially strategic ones may

927
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,079
require some future investment who

928
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:38,200
assigns to value the consequence if

929
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:41,470
those risks actually occur who weighs

930
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:43,089
the risk probability and assigns of cost

931
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:45,339
to the consequence is that something you

932
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:47,379
would do or is that a team effort with

933
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:49,328
other departments as well so that would

934
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:51,038
definitely is recti and great question

935
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:53,109
are we a direct tie in to our risk

936
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:56,859
management folks so that risk registry I

937
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:58,779
touched on earlier we want that threat

938
00:34:56,859 --> 00:35:00,670
and threat intelligence driven program

939
00:34:58,779 --> 00:35:01,930
so we want to do those bigger strategic

940
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,700
things that aren't going to be quick

941
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:05,049
fixes hey go check this setting and this

942
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,848
server and make sure we're not acting

943
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:08,920
we're not we're not gonna get hit by

944
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:10,779
this but this is gonna take months to

945
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,819
implement we need to get that on a risk

946
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:15,190
register and the risk management work is

947
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:17,259
gonna be that for us they're the ones

948
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:20,019
that should drive that and keep that

949
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:21,489
that strategic level and getting it to

950
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:26,979
leadership hey this is where we need to

951
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:28,900
invest so when you add to that and by

952
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,710
the way I'm Jillian King I'm the

953
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,509
director of our monitoring

954
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,489
investigations and response teams which

955
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:35,440
is our INR their intelligence and our

956
00:35:33,489 --> 00:35:37,359
digital forensics team there is an

957
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,769
intentional effort for us to as a

958
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:41,890
collective leadership to you come

959
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:43,808
together and identify what our top 10

960
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:46,150
information security risks are and we do

961
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:47,950
do use a lot of the information that's a

962
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,930
part of the risk registry to make the

963
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:51,640
streets specific strategic decisions

964
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:55,660
around where our investments are gonna

965
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:58,328
be over the next course you know one to

966
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,680
three years right so we do take into

967
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:02,230
consideration that now as far as

968
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,450
associating a cost with each risk we

969
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:06,759
have not quite mature to that space yet

970
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,558
and as Brian mentioned it's kind of hard

971
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:11,259
sometimes to quantify it but we do have

972
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:14,259
enough external use cases that we can

973
00:36:11,259 --> 00:36:15,309
use to leverage and quantify from the

974
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:18,160
risk that's in place

975
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:20,259
okay so that was leading into my next

976
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,509
question which is the risk management

977
00:36:20,259 --> 00:36:24,430
side is in one big organization and

978
00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:30,070
Willie too looks at everything from

979
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:32,319
hail damage to cyberthreats

980
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:34,000
or is it you have like a team that

981
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,380
specializes the cyberthreats and works

982
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,300
as part of a big organization how's that

983
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,260
structured out yeah so the risk

984
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,670
management I'm talking about is

985
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,440
definitely information and risk

986
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,830
management and so there underneath are

987
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,400
seaso

988
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:47,529
and they are they are in order Jamelia

989
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,360
has her section of security there's

990
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:56,050
there's a lead over our over our

991
00:36:49,360 --> 00:37:08,290
information risk management area other

992
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:10,030
questions that's good so when you do

993
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:12,880
your situational awareness what's

994
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:15,040
happening okay have you had a lot of

995
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,510
chance to look at that or are you now

996
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,480
pretty much just using your portal with

997
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:21,430
different dashboards if you will to kind

998
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,340
of give you an overview and figure out

999
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:35,069
what you need to focus on short and

1000
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:35,070
medium term not example awareness versus

1001
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:39,820
well you mentioned a portal right you

1002
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:45,070
mentioned that you've got different

1003
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:46,540
feeds and you basically look for feeds

1004
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,890
match each other so you don't have to

1005
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:51,580
read the same thing two or three times

1006
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:54,150
from five different sources is that just

1007
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:56,340
basically like an email is it a

1008
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,960
significant activity report rolling by

1009
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:01,270
do you have it depicted on the network

1010
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,950
architecture you know how do you how do

1011
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,900
you just display that information so

1012
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,819
people can intuitively act on it faster

1013
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,560
if it's feasible gotcha

1014
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:10,840
so our threat intelligence feeds are

1015
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,210
very much only for the threat

1016
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,520
intelligence team so there's our tip it

1017
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,930
so we get login to our tip we do have

1018
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,700
access to the portals of all of our

1019
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:21,399
different providers right and we can log

1020
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:23,230
in I sack when you log in InfraGard but

1021
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,640
for the most part wherever we can it all

1022
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:27,130
goes into our tips we have one place to

1023
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,540
login but literally that tip has four

1024
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:31,330
users and it's the four threat

1025
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:33,070
intelligence analysts or consultants so

1026
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:35,080
there's only four people they can log

1027
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:37,660
into it and we're the ones that see that

1028
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,020
data so how it gets disseminated to the

1029
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,970
rest

1030
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,470
organization is through our those all

1031
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:44,470
those different reporting mechanism I

1032
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:47,560
talked about flash RFI weekly the those

1033
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:49,089
are in and I and we have also have a

1034
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,940
weekly meeting where we stand up and

1035
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:53,950
talk to you I've skipped over that in my

1036
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,510
notes but so that's how those that

1037
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:58,410
information kind of gets disseminated

1038
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:58,410
across the org

1039
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,600
well quickly I'll just show you this

1040
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:10,310
because again I as I mentioned at the

1041
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,110
front it front end of this I this was a

1042
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:14,210
presentation I gave to it to an industry

1043
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:16,400
conference and so I was this was my

1044
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:17,870
attempt to throw up some threat

1045
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,190
intelligence type stuff to kind of give

1046
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,930
you an idea of some of the models and

1047
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,550
different things out there there in the

1048
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,259
center is the the threat intelligence

1049
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:26,780
lifecycle that we saw on the front and

1050
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:30,230
the agenda slides so again planning a

1051
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:33,440
direction collection processing it and

1052
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:35,180
analyzing it getting the information out

1053
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,650
and then and then going again right and

1054
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:39,980
it's just this constant cycle where

1055
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:41,780
because threat actors change and so and

1056
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,270
there's always more and more threats so

1057
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:47,480
so that's kind of that that model and so

1058
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:49,700
I've talked about threat modeling and so

1059
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,340
there's the the diamond model which is

1060
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,200
what you're gonna see both the top left

1061
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:56,570
and right is the same same thing and

1062
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,009
there's also the kill chain a lot of

1063
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,720
times there's a lot of a lot of talk

1064
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:01,340
about hey do you guys use the diamond

1065
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,500
model or do you use the kill chain and

1066
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,700
again don't get me wrong we I said we

1067
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,500
don't really do a lot of threat modeling

1068
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,799
right now so it's not saying we're doing

1069
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:11,510
this but what I in my mind the right way

1070
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,480
to do this is you it's not they're not

1071
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,770
exclusive you do both I mentioned the

1072
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,990
threat intelligence class we all took

1073
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,400
last year that was definitely something

1074
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,450
we did and as a matter of fact they took

1075
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,760
it even farther and called it a

1076
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:25,640
competing hypothesis procedure which was

1077
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,350
really complicated but that's more like

1078
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,940
what's in the bottom left-hand corner so

1079
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:31,370
you take the kill chain on the left and

1080
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:34,100
then you got different adversary I know

1081
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:36,700
it's very small but those columns are

1082
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:39,680
all different adversaries or different

1083
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,810
scenarios going on and then the diamond

1084
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,669
model is in each one of those so in each

1085
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,090
one of those you're all in the diamond

1086
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,400
model

1087
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:48,110
what's my capability what's my who's my

1088
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,880
adversary what's their capability what

1089
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:53,750
infrastructure are they use in and who

1090
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:56,570
are they trying to pone right and you

1091
00:40:53,750 --> 00:41:00,800
you do that diamond model in each phase

1092
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:02,990
of the kill chain for each each actor or

1093
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:07,850
each adversary or each scenario in that

1094
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:09,500
competing hypothesis so so it's a very

1095
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,880
quick thing but the the diamond model

1096
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,810
specifically you look into focusing on

1097
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,540
the top left corner

1098
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:16,160
it's basically what way you can read

1099
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,400
that is the adversary deploys a

1100
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,680
capability over some

1101
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,529
structure you own writer you have and

1102
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,700
they do that against a victim right so

1103
00:41:23,529 --> 00:41:27,039
that's what the diamond model does have

1104
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:30,578
a surge capability via via

1105
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:31,720
infrastructure to affect a victim and so

1106
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:33,369
that's what the diamond model is there

1107
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,470
for is just to model these threats and

1108
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:37,240
say who's my adversary what are they

1109
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:38,459
using what are their capabilities and

1110
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,379
who are they trying to get a hold of

1111
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,630
where the kill chain and the kill chain

1112
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:47,880
again it's super small but the kill

1113
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:51,970
chain is reconnaissance weaponization

1114
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:54,789
delivery exploitation installation

1115
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:56,828
command and control and then actions on

1116
00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:58,630
objectives and so basically that's the

1117
00:41:56,829 --> 00:42:01,690
kind of the life cycle of the bad guy

1118
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,890
right and so at first you might find

1119
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:06,460
them and they're just they're just doing

1120
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:07,960
a vulnerability scan or you know an in

1121
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,279
map against your organization that's for

1122
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,200
common sense right they're just trying

1123
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:13,329
to understand what you have and where

1124
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,250
and where they could attack you right

1125
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:16,569
and then weaponization that's where

1126
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:20,200
they're gonna start creating some remote

1127
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:21,700
access malware's and creating viruses

1128
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,649
and worms for you so that they could do

1129
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,720
that and then they deliver it to you

1130
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:28,029
pretty so explanatory and then you get

1131
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,020
exploited and then once you exploit a

1132
00:42:28,029 --> 00:42:30,670
lot of times that are installing

1133
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:32,200
something on on there too so that they

1134
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:35,410
can maintain their presence on your

1135
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:37,029
network right and and then that's where

1136
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,618
the command and control comes in the

1137
00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:40,089
next-to-last piece and then once they

1138
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:41,650
have that then they start their actions

1139
00:42:40,089 --> 00:42:45,038
and start doing what they want to do to

1140
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:47,140
you and so so that's what's down again

1141
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:49,690
the left-hand side of that chart on the

1142
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:51,339
bottom left is the kill chain and then

1143
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:53,109
the diamond models are in each one and

1144
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:54,788
then each one of those columns are

1145
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:56,710
different adversaries or different

1146
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:59,529
avenues they're trying to do like you

1147
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:02,589
could say they're trying to attack port

1148
00:42:59,529 --> 00:43:04,779
443 and they're also trying to email

1149
00:43:02,589 --> 00:43:06,849
fish and they're also trying there so

1150
00:43:04,779 --> 00:43:08,859
that you could keep track of and that's

1151
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:11,230
how you kind of model threats and so

1152
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:12,730
this was a threat model threat hunt

1153
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:14,470
thing i wanted to share with you guys a

1154
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:17,400
little extra research i did to try to

1155
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:18,640
throw in there to provide that college

1156
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,260
knowledge

1157
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:24,970
over-over process so but then after that

1158
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:27,549
that is literally all i have i go back

1159
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:30,700
to my question slide and then we can be

1160
00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:31,960
done back to that previous slide yes sir

1161
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:35,618
on a pier

1162
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:37,450
it on the right basically are you

1163
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:41,140
categorizing how tough it is to deal

1164
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:43,660
with those different threats if you will

1165
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:46,569
or potential threats or capabilities

1166
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:48,490
thank you I that's called the pyramid of

1167
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:51,130
pain thank you for pointing that out

1168
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:54,490
that's the pyramid of pain and so yes

1169
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:57,790
what that saying is that's how that's

1170
00:43:54,490 --> 00:44:01,060
what you what you can how hard it is so

1171
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:03,730
to try to get to the TTP level and and

1172
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:06,099
protect against that and detect against

1173
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:07,780
that is super tough right and so as you

1174
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:09,010
go down trying to figure out what tools

1175
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:11,470
are going to use and stuff is

1176
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:14,230
challenging you know hash values super

1177
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:16,480
easy to detect super easy to block super

1178
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:18,790
easy to go out and get some my OCS on

1179
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,099
that IP address is also easy right

1180
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:22,779
domain names a little bit harder but

1181
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:24,280
still pretty simple so that's what

1182
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,770
that's representing is how hard it is

1183
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:29,890
did it defend against detect against how

1184
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:31,960
hard it is to go gather data on so it's

1185
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:34,180
called the pyramid of pain I'm glad you

1186
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:44,260
pointed out as like totally right past

1187
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:46,480
it so anything else okay there's nothing

1188
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,450
else that's thank Brian for his team for

1189
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:53,480
coming up here tonight

1190
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:53,480
[Applause]

1191
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:00,910
