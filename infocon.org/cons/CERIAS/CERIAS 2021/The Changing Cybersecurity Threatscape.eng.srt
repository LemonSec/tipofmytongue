computer security club which is i think

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,479
kind of a

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,640
kind of a sister club to the purdue

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,200
security club i know some of our alumni

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,520
are there at purdue now and if you guys

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,840
have come down and done um some captured

49
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,600
flag competitions and so forth

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,920
so and i know we you know we gave some

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,240
advice and mentoring to to getting that

52
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,200
club started some years ago

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,600
and uh my own teaching background is in

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,520
cryptography network security mobile

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,000
wireless security digital forensics

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,479
ethical hacking and so forth so i've

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,560
been doing that for a long time

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,640
and um our company is one that does uh

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,560
manage programs for

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
for other companies so

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
you'll have

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,920
a lot of companies out there especially

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,360
in what i would call the mid market

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,760
range which is you know like 50 million

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,879
dollars in sales up to a billion dollars

66
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,160
they know they need help with cyber

67
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,519
security they don't have anybody

68
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,519
in-house that can do the work uh it's

69
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,519
hard to find the people now

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,519
there's something like a 4 million

71
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,040
person worldwide shortage of cyber

72
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,519
security talent in you know around

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,000
so um finding the right people and

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,920
getting them in-house and so forth very

75
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,959
difficult

76
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,720
so you could outsource that whole thing

77
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,640
to a company like ours that can manage

78
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,160
it from top to bottom and i'll talk a

79
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,920
little bit later about you know what

80
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,360
what are all the things you should be

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,400
doing

82
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,200
um for any organization to try to combat

83
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,879
the these emerging threats they're going

84
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,440
to be talking about

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,519
um

86
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,239
yes uh it's funny to see the empty room

87
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,040
there uh last time i was there

88
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,640
this is what i looked like i don't know

89
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,879
what i was doing i do remember i was i

90
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,959
had a really bad cold at the time so i

91
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,920
was constantly uh blowing my nose or

92
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,920
whatever and yeah i was carrying a

93
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,400
couple of extra pounds there i think

94
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,200
um but i was more actively doing um you

95
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,319
know

96
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,640
boots on the ground hands-on

97
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,120
hacking stuff back then i'm more of a

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,959
business development facing role these

99
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,480
days although i still get you know i

100
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,319
still get my hands dirty doing a bit of

101
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,920
technical as well

102
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
um you know i'm kind of the big picture

103
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,760
person you know they

104
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,000
i have you know a deep background and 30

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,159
years experience and looking at

106
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,799
every shape and size of system and so

107
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,239
understanding what the security needs

108
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,920
are and recommending solutions is kind

109
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,879
of my

110
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,120
forte now so here's where to talk about

111
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,560
today

112
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,599
um

113
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,400
how has the world kind of changed um

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,760
from an i.t

115
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,480
an i.t security standpoint since

116
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,640
kovit 19 and all the work from home

117
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,400
that's that's been happening

118
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,640
um and what is what is the impact of

119
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,599
that on you know infrastructures you

120
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,959
know what what do we

121
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,320
how do we handle that now it's called

122
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
zero trust but you know what does that

123
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,839
mean exactly

124
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,160
um i went to black hat briefings out in

125
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,960
las vegas a few weeks ago

126
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
nice to get back you know in person to

127
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,479
some of these events def con and so

128
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,440
forth

129
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,479
um

130
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,080
and uh you know there's only about half

131
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,680
as many people as usual but you know

132
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
there's more one-on-one intimate

133
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,840
conversations it wasn't all bad

134
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,520
but talking some of the vendors there at

135
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,360
black hat there wasn't even any

136
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,479
agreement on what like the term xdr

137
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,280
means

138
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,960
you might have heard of edr endpoint

139
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,560
detection response and you might have

140
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,639
heard of ndr network detection response

141
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,560
and then there's this idea of xdr which

142
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,360
is

143
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,080
you know across the board to end point

144
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,720
network cloud everything

145
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,840
that's

146
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,560
not always the agreed upon definition so

147
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,400
you had you have these vendors out there

148
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,479
trying to sell solutions and solve a

149
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,720
problem where the problem space is not

150
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,800
even very well defined i think that it's

151
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,639
the same situation with zero trust and

152
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,400
so we'll get into that what what i think

153
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,759
it means

154
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,440
um and then others might disagree with

155
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,560
me but that's this is my take on it

156
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,120
um talking about software you know

157
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,960
trusted software that you invited your

158
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,320
environment from these third-party

159
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,120
vendors and you're expecting it to to be

160
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,280
trusted but not so much anymore as we've

161
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,400
learned from

162
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,080
the solar winds attack and we'll talk a

163
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,400
little bit about that

164
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,000
um

165
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,400
in working with ransomware and

166
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,680
understanding ransomware and having to

167
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,400
do

168
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,479
digital forensic cleanups over the last

169
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,000
few years and

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,440
working with partners who actually have

171
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,919
to negotiate ransomware payments from

172
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,360
these attack groups you know with a

173
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,000
bitcoin payment and so forth

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,880
um

175
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,479
we've learned some things about

176
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,319
ransomware and how it launches and how

177
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,080
it how they land

178
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,800
it in environments which might surprise

179
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
you of the you know initial attack

180
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,319
attack vectors

181
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,800
that we will get into

182
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,720
another um area i've been kind of

183
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,560
studying up on recently writing some

184
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,960
blog posts and white papers on is

185
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,520
it seems to be a rampant issue of

186
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,600
ssl vpn vulnerabilities in these

187
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,520
firewalls so i'll talk about

188
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,759
what that issue is and why that's such a

189
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,000
big deal

190
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,120
um

191
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,479
because a lot of people ask me they're

192
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,560
like oh what you know what about ai

193
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,160
machine learning what is that doing for

194
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,720
cyber we'll touch on that for a bit

195
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,520
and see you know what is the real

196
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,360
how does that change

197
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,280
the threat scape you know are we seeing

198
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,919
more and more like ai based attacks

199
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,400
and get into that and then you talk a

200
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,680
little bit about what are the best

201
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,160
practices people should be doing

202
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,639
to combat all of these threats um as

203
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,400
time permits at the end

204
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,160
you know i'll i'll open up two questions

205
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,560
and um i think we'll also

206
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
uh maybe if there's any questions as

207
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,160
we're going along you know maybe we'll

208
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,440
just bring those to my attention i'll

209
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,599
try to answer them as we go along

210
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,080
just raise your hand or whatever or

211
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,400
enter something into the question

212
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,720
box

213
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,520
so first um looking at this post covered

214
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,039
world

215
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,880
you know there was this kind of

216
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,240
traditional view before covid of

217
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
and by the way this traditional view was

218
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
definitely going away long before this i

219
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,440
would say even

220
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,840
even since the early 2000s the

221
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,360
traditional view has been

222
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,039
you know eroded

223
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,479
in favor of

224
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,720
you know modern architectures where the

225
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,880
majority of traffic you know is not

226
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,280
behind the firewall anymore so but there

227
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,039
there was this you know traditional

228
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,919
notion or viewpoint of a network

229
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,960
and of your i.t infrastructure as being

230
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,280
clearly defined where the perimeter is

231
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,960
the majority of traffic is behind the

232
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,919
firewall you could apply in enterprise

233
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,319
policies across the board

234
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,560
um and you know you had kind of

235
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,240
well-defined security challenges just

236
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
keep people out and then you're pretty

237
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,440
good

238
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,680
well as you know from cloud computing

239
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,520
from using software as a service you

240
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,039
know online

241
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,720
um

242
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,319
it's it's difficult to even find

243
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,000
people's data like where where it

244
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,240
belongs anymore when we come in and do

245
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,759
an assessment

246
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,440
the first thing we try to do is discover

247
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,000
where their critical data are so i'm

248
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,319
just taking an example of a professional

249
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,759
sports team that we've worked with the

250
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,440
major league baseball team

251
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
not not the hometown race not anybody

252
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,919
local i won't say who it was but it's a

253
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,559
very prominent mlb team

254
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,000
and the first thing we did is you know

255
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,599
where's your data

256
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,760
some of it was on premises some of it

257
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,600
was in a data center some of it was in a

258
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,240
cloud some of it were was in the

259
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,160
software as a service solution so

260
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,480
payroll had their own sas that they're

261
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,440
using

262
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,399
um

263
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,480
finance had their own ticketing had

264
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,920
their own actually the ticketing was

265
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,360
funny because they initially thought

266
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,040
they were running everything on a server

267
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,880
in in their environment it turned out it

268
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,839
was in a

269
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,680
in a cloud-based uh

270
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,920
server which then interfaced through an

271
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
api connector into

272
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,000
like ticketmaster server

273
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,360
um

274
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
they had these like moneyball guys you

275
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,000
know the the analytics folks that they

276
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,360
brought in from google to run the

277
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,040
numbers on you know

278
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,959
what players should they go after to try

279
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,160
to get a trade for or draft uh who reach

280
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,399
base have the highest on base percentage

281
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,399
and things like that these guys so

282
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,560
everybody else was on office 365 in

283
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,880
exchange and these guys like google's

284
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,920
they're on g suite in google drive so i

285
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,839
mean it was just there was no

286
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,000
centralized i.t visibility control for

287
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,480
any of this right the data was was

288
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,000
scattered everywhere there was

289
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,200
unstructured

290
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,760
data you know sensitive financials as

291
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,200
well as personally identifiable

292
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,399
information

293
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,240
um just kind of everywhere and that's

294
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,000
that's what we see in the lower

295
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,399
uh left-hand corner of the of the screen

296
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,279
is

297
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,959
everything is happening outside the

298
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,600
firewall now and finding just finding

299
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,680
the data first of all is the big

300
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,519
challenge and then figuring out how to

301
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,440
lock it down and secure it as the second

302
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,800
part of that

303
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,920
um

304
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,600
as we're doing right now with zoom or go

305
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,440
to meeting or teams

306
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,120
a lot of your communications a lot of

307
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,920
your

308
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,279
you know

309
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,600
chat your messaging and everything is

310
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,120
going to be outside

311
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,320
the

312
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,519
traditionally protected perimeter now

313
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,800
i just noticed what was it

314
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,640
the department of department of defense

315
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,399
had its own

316
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,120
um web and chat services

317
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
and messaging services through disa the

318
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,200
defense information systems agency

319
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,120
they're they're going to deprecate that

320
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,680
now in favor of moving everything to

321
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,440
commercial off the shelf you know like

322
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,360
microsoft teams i thought that was an

323
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,200
interesting move for them

324
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,640
so there's there's a lot of security

325
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,640
challenges that i i guess they feel that

326
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,600
um

327
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,320
office 365 and microsoft

328
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,440
and teams and azure have addressed

329
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,920
i know that there is a

330
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,240
certification called fedramp

331
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,399
um that is anybody that wants to do

332
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,800
business with the federal government in

333
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,640
the cloud has to go through this

334
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,200
accreditation process and i know that um

335
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,040
azure has done that so it might have

336
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,560
done that for that for their environment

337
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,000
so

338
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,440
long and short is

339
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,279
you've got this emerging view that

340
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,880
requires a new type of approach and the

341
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,800
new approach is called zero trust

342
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,600
and here's jeremy's take on xero trust

343
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,880
which might be

344
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,560
slightly at odds with what other people

345
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,920
think it is but

346
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,200
um

347
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,279
my idea of zero of trust is that i

348
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,800
assume somebody's already inside my

349
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,920
environment

350
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,480
and how can i limit them to what they

351
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
can get to make sure they can't get to

352
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,519
my crown jewels of data

353
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,600
that they can't make any you know

354
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,760
negative changes make changes are going

355
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,519
to affect the security margin of my

356
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,880
enterprise

357
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,600
so to do that and i also want to kick

358
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,680
them out right so they can't and fix the

359
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,000
problem that let them get in

360
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,480
so that's how i think of zero trust um

361
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,240
it's just like uh you know the navy has

362
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,040
to build ships that are gonna reach

363
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,800
their their destination even if they

364
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,079
spring a lake

365
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,320
right so they there has to be ways

366
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,320
um to um cordon off or you know seal

367
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,399
steal the breached parts of the ship or

368
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,680
bail them out

369
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
so they can continue on its journey and

370
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,760
get to where it's going um in the same

371
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,480
way that's kind of the new normal for

372
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,000
uh these environments you know

373
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,519
everything's happening outside the

374
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,120
firewall

375
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,440
so i want to have micro segmentation in

376
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,839
place which means

377
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,760
if they get into one thing they can't

378
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,040
then leverage

379
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,279
that foothold to move laterally get get

380
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,360
into other things in my environment i

381
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,800
want to add single sign-on with

382
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,200
multi-factor authentication everywhere

383
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,480
so um

384
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,639
having a single sign-on solution is

385
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,320
great because then you really only have

386
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,600
to have one

387
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,519
password along with you know a

388
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,120
multi-factor

389
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,839
um thing like you know on a some kind of

390
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,800
octa or duo or other authenticator app

391
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,880
google microsoft on your phone that you

392
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,079
have to then

393
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,959
click a positive sign off or some enter

394
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,040
some code that's changing

395
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,480
and you want to have your provisioning

396
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,160
all done through that single sign-on

397
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,279
portal as well because then again

398
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,120
you can create long and strong passwords

399
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,560
and multi-factor authentication for

400
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,360
everything you're getting into

401
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
you want to have xdr which is you know

402
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,959
edr

403
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,000
managed

404
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,839
uh

405
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,240
endpoint detection and response

406
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,720
uh agents and monitoring everywhere

407
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,279
so you have to put sensors out there

408
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,399
that collect data and report up to

409
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,000
a centralized

410
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
aggregation server and then you want to

411
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,560
run correlation rules on that to

412
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,160
generate security alerts we'll come back

413
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,560
to that in a minute

414
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,720
the other things that i would call

415
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,079
you know that need to be monitored and

416
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,480
need to be accounted for

417
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,079
are uh

418
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
shadow i.t so bringing under centralized

419
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,959
visibility control things you might not

420
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,240
have thought of

421
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,040
where

422
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,480
the company runs for example uh social

423
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,399
media

424
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,040
a a business will run a good portion of

425
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,959
their operations on social media they'll

426
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,079
use linkedin for hr and hiring they'll

427
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,959
use you know twitter and facebook for

428
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,199
public relations and promotions

429
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,079
um

430
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,600
i've seen twitter used for helpdesk

431
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,040
support before right you know um so

432
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,800
all right the question is you know are

433
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
you monitoring that are you is it under

434
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,680
centralized i.t visibility and control

435
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,079
is it under multi-factor authentication

436
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,000
the answer is a lot of times no a lot of

437
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,079
times it's being run by

438
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,399
the pr department and there are security

439
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,760
amateurs they don't know anything about

440
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
security and so you'll see account

441
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
takeovers account

442
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,360
impersonations

443
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,320
um

444
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,720
you know uh and then embarrassing stuff

445
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,079
happens to the company where they're

446
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,399
posting stuff they didn't mean to post

447
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,800
so that's just one area that um needs to

448
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,360
be brought under that control and it may

449
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,440
not traditionally have been included in

450
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,240
a security plan

451
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,880
all right so

452
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,120
um

453
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,519
in the past you know if you had a trust

454
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,120
relationship with a software vendor

455
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,959
let's just take for example

456
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,040
uh zoom right or

457
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
microsoft teams

458
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,800
you're assuming hopefully

459
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,480
uh that they're not you know stealing

460
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,639
your private data that they're not um

461
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,160
planting trojan horses in your

462
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,360
environment

463
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,440
um that will allow attackers to do

464
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
remote code execution and so forth

465
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,839
you know this is the this is the

466
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,199
contract

467
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,279
that you have with them

468
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,120
has anybody ever stopped to read all the

469
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,440
terms of services in this

470
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,759
um software agreements i mean a lot of

471
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,040
it is saying you're not gonna do

472
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,199
anything bad to them like reverse

473
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,320
engineer their software and misuse it

474
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,839
but they don't really promise that

475
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,000
they're not gonna do anything bad to you

476
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,399
in the case of solar winds

477
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,440
i don't know if you're familiar with

478
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,639
this attack that took place late in 2020

479
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,040
but it's very wide-ranging attack

480
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,880
um the way what happened was um

481
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,839
a company called uh mandiant fireeye

482
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,079
which is a you know top-rated security

483
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,360
company

484
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,800
determined that there was an attack in

485
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,519
their own environment and that some

486
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,680
russian apt advanced persistent threat

487
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,199
group had come in

488
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,040
and stolen some of their

489
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,399
security tools that they used for red

490
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,560
teaming you know pen testing

491
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,399
and they when they figured out how it

492
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,160
happened it turned out that it was

493
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,920
through um

494
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,519
this a trojanized backdoor

495
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,040
in their

496
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,639
solarwinds software solarwinds if you're

497
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,240
not familiar is

498
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,399
some network management and health and

499
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,279
status reporting software very good you

500
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,079
know software code um i mean you know

501
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,160
software program that a lot of people

502
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,559
use something like 30 000 customers they

503
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,359
had

504
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,799
and a good number of them something like

505
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,000
1800 had up had downloaded

506
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,720
a

507
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,959
um infected

508
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,520
update to the software so started with

509
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,839
um they called it sunspot

510
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,959
sunspot

511
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,240
the apt actors had gotten into the

512
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,319
devops environment

513
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,559
of solarwinds and had actually planted

514
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,520
this

515
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,320
this uh process there some kind of back

516
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,440
door said that whenever they kicked off

517
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,120
a build they would look for like um

518
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,000
microsoft visual studio process running

519
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,280
and they would

520
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,400
inject

521
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,160
uh their code in there and they would do

522
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,400
things like suppress error messages and

523
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
and compiler warnings

524
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,600
just in case any you know just to make

525
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,440
sure they didn't see what was going on

526
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,679
and they they actually built um a back

527
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,400
door into this uh code that was going

528
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,760
out to the for people that are updating

529
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,000
their solarwinds software

530
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,760
well what were they doing they were

531
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,360
dropping in

532
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,640
a dropper um indicate the first case was

533
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,000
sunburst which was a customized tool to

534
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,400
allow command and control

535
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,840
access

536
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,600
and we're going to get into this in a

537
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,240
little bit but there's a

538
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,919
there's a basic game

539
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,840
in the attacker play and

540
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,520
that's surveillance on your target

541
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,919
finding an initial vulnerability that

542
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,520
you can exploit

543
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,600
um gaining persistence for later

544
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,840
gathering passwords and credentials

545
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,000
things like that moving laterally but

546
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,840
one of the key things that always

547
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,520
happens is establishing command and

548
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,720
control

549
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
because that allows them to

550
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,000
basically have taken over the

551
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,880
environment and continue to manipulate

552
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,120
the environment as long as they like

553
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,679
um the other droppers we're dropping a

554
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,600
tool called cobalt stripe if you're not

555
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,280
familiar with that

556
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,360
it's an exploit framework so it's

557
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,240
actually a commercial off-the-shelf tool

558
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,440
um

559
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,280
you're like well couldn't they just

560
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,120
couldn't just look for the use of that

561
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,440
tool in your environment

562
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,919
maybe but they probably um

563
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,440
probably made a where's version of it

564
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,039
which means they had like source code

565
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,160
and then they

566
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,200
um

567
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,880
modified it slightly and created a

568
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,240
different binary that might have a

569
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,000
different signature than you might

570
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,600
typically see for cobalt strike there's

571
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
still ways to actually look for

572
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,440
for you know the running cobalt strike

573
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,720
process but

574
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,960
um a an exploit framework is used by

575
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,600
penetration testers to go try to

576
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,200
you know red team a system and try to

577
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,640
get into it and see if you can exploit

578
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,720
vulnerabilities and it offers a great

579
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,840
you know after

580
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,760
you've achieved an exploit and you have

581
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,200
a shell

582
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,960
it really allows you to maintain

583
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,360
persistence to do all kinds of commands

584
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,120
and interacting with the environment as

585
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,880
you know remote access

586
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,559
uh terminal

587
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,240
so that was the reason for that but my

588
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,159
question is

589
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,440
how did they initially land that

590
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,159
sunspot into the devops environment of

591
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,720
solarwinds and i've seen a lot of things

592
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,000
about how

593
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,840
how sunspot worked and all these

594
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,120
droppers and

595
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,440
and the fallout from it but i've never

596
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,360
seen anything reported about how they

597
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,039
initially got into the solar winds

598
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,559
environment and i i think it was because

599
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,960
maybe they didn't have adequate

600
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,679
security monitoring in place themselves

601
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,679
that's just my theory but

602
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,960
we'll uh

603
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,280
i'll come back and um your eyes on that

604
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
some more so i got a question for the uh

605
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,440
for the audience

606
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,919
um in talking about like maze ransomware

607
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,200
which is one of the more common types of

608
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,880
ransomware we've seen over the last

609
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,039
couple of years very annoying

610
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,640
we've actually had to dig out a number

611
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,159
of customers from

612
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,720
maze ransomware attacks i mentioned

613
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,919
in this case we um we have a partner

614
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,159
that we get we don't i mean i don't want

615
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:58,880
to

616
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,760
handle ransom right i mean

617
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,679
we'll help you

618
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,440
rebuild restore recover we'll help you

619
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,080
put in proactive controls and by the way

620
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,480
none of our managed services customers

621
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,400
knock on wood have ever been hit with

622
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,000
ransomware because we'll see one of

623
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,520
these indicators compromised early

624
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,919
enough in the game that we can stop it

625
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,760
and kick the intruder out before it

626
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,799
becomes

627
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,880
a ransom situation

628
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
but this was a third party referral to

629
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,640
us in this case

630
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,960
um from i think a lawyer

631
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,640
and

632
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,440
they um

633
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,760
and we had to engage with somebody to

634
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,960
negotiate

635
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,039
a decryption key for the environment

636
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,200
reason being unfortunately

637
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,440
they didn't have good backups in place

638
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,120
so that when they're when their primary

639
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,360
servers got encrypted

640
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,919
their backups also got encrypted

641
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,039
they thought they were backing up to the

642
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,120
cloud uh they were only backing up to a

643
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,600
local network area storage and so they

644
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
lost everything all their financials

645
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,120
going back for two years they couldn't

646
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,720
ship product they couldn't receive

647
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,159
payments they couldn't do anything so

648
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,679
they had to pay

649
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,360
um i think it was close to half a

650
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,520
million dollars to get a decrypt key for

651
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,400
their

652
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,559
environment

653
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,880
so my question for you what do you think

654
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,960
the initial vector of attack is for most

655
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,600
ransomware

656
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,480
anybody we're going to vote on that do

657
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,120
you think it's service misconfiguration

658
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,280
phishing and social engineering

659
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,120
or remote desktop misconfiguration

660
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,799
well i think a lot of people might guess

661
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,720
b right because people i think people

662
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,320
are the weakest link

663
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,240
but in fact in working with this third

664
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,679
party who's done

665
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,799
the most

666
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,720
ransomware negotiations over the last

667
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,880
two years of basically anybody

668
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,560
we found out it was

669
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,000
[Music]

670
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,880
remote access misconfiguration so remote

671
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,159
desktop

672
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,240
uh setting that up improperly you're

673
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,240
basically opening a pipeline into your

674
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,600
environment

675
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,000
um so this is with you know

676
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,679
uh team viewer

677
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,640
or um go to my pc

678
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,919
or you know

679
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,280
rdp port

680
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,720
3389

681
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,440
in any of those are basically the same

682
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,799
thing where you're

683
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,080
if you allow

684
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,679
that connection to come in from anywhere

685
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,440
you haven't white listed it to only a

686
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,280
trusted known ip

687
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,039
um and if you're allowing you know

688
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,960
unlimited connection attempts they can

689
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,679
try brute force password guessing or

690
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,360
they can try what's called credential

691
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,760
stuffing where they go and find they go

692
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
look in the dark web where they look on

693
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,840
someone you know they get a a cache of

694
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,320
passwords from some other website or or

695
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,600
domain that's been breached and then

696
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,200
they try those out again because people

697
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,120
tend to reuse passwords

698
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,320
um

699
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,880
against all advice they do that

700
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,360
and and uh so through the remote access

701
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,559
misconfiguration that's how they're

702
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,559
getting in most of the time

703
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,440
um

704
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,799
you know i rounded these off a little

705
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,520
bit i think it's more like 62.5

706
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,919
for remote access and um

707
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,159
roughly a third or 30 in through

708
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,679
phishing and social engineering tricking

709
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,679
somebody to click on a on a link in an

710
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,840
email tricking somebody into going to a

711
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,159
fake site that looks like the real one

712
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,720
in downloading malware or you know

713
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,960
entering their credentials uh somewhere

714
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,640
in the wrong place

715
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,240
and then an uh 10 of you know

716
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,559
mis unpatched or missing patches or

717
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,880
deprecated operating systems

718
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,640
and so forth um

719
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,880
just an example that might be you know

720
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,200
some some things i've seen out there

721
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,480
uh running

722
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,840
an old version of

723
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,000
um microsoft exchange

724
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,679
so um

725
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,360
a lot of people have migrated into like

726
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,159
off three office 365 online in the cloud

727
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,919
and so forth but a lot of people still

728
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,799
run an old exchange server and

729
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,480
they might forget to patch that you know

730
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,440
they might

731
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,760
they might patch their windows and you

732
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,520
know and all those things associated

733
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,640
with that but they might have forgotten

734
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,400
to go past their exchange and there's

735
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,559
been an awful lot of exchange attacks of

736
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,440
late

737
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,760
um that's been in the news quite quite

738
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,880
often lately

739
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,320
another thing we see you know if we're

740
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,919
ever doing red teaming or penetration

741
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,440
testing we're going to always be lined

742
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,400
for any

743
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
old unsupported operating systems

744
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,480
because they're very easy to exploit

745
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,960
they they can't be updated so i'm

746
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,559
talking about windows windows server

747
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,760
2003 windows 7 um and some other things

748
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,000
that are still out there in wide

749
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,360
proliferation

750
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,919
uh in many many places so those are the

751
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,720
ways people get in

752
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,520
why

753
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,600
is this ransomware such a big pain and

754
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,120
you know what um

755
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,919
well

756
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,080
these are really good business people

757
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,440
you might have heard this before but

758
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,679
they um they typically

759
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,600
have you know good customer service

760
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,720
right they um they will uh you know if

761
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,039
you if you pay they'll they'll get you

762
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,400
your decrypt key because they want to

763
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,240
make sure they don't get the reputation

764
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,760
that you know they're not going to give

765
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,679
you the key if you pay because that's

766
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,120
bad for business

767
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,000
um

768
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
they also are utilizing multiple

769
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,159
extortion methods you know backups is

770
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:58,960
just

771
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,360
one way to combat ransomware but that

772
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,440
does absolutely nothing about them

773
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,159
threatening to dox you which is putting

774
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,840
all your private information out there

775
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,679
on the on the web and

776
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,760
embarrassing you or even reporting you

777
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,640
to

778
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,720
um say authorities if you're a publicly

779
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,600
traded company uh you you're

780
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,000
the commerce department might fine you

781
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,400
for allowing your your customer data to

782
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,360
be

783
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,880
exploited

784
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,679
so they'll threaten you with with the uh

785
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,559
double extortion number one we won't let

786
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,400
you have your data back at all unless

787
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,679
you pay us for the decrypt key and

788
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,799
number two

789
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:35,919
um

790
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,000
you know if if you think you can recover

791
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,320
from backups we're just gonna uh put all

792
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,840
your private data out there anywhere it

793
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,360
way and just embarrass you and you'll

794
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,240
take your reputational hit you know

795
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,919
um another thing is they have very

796
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,480
successful affiliate programs so

797
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,720
they'll hire a team of penetration

798
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,880
testers red teamers to come in

799
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,440
and find a system that they can then

800
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,559
exploit

801
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,440
and then

802
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,679
uh they'll hand the system over to the

803
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,440
the ransomware gang which will then pay

804
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,760
them some money and say uh we'll give

805
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,080
you some percentage of whatever recover

806
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,000
you know on the ransom

807
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,080
so it's just it's a big business now you

808
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,159
know multi-billion dollars

809
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,200
and um

810
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,400
you know at the end we could talk some

811
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,159
more about you know what how does that

812
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,320
look you know with the russian oligarchs

813
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,760
and all that stuff

814
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,000
um

815
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,840
let's see

816
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,039
moving on

817
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,159
all right so this is what we're talking

818
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,200
about early earlier

819
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,279
if i don't know if you cover this in any

820
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,960
of your classes but

821
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,640
i would look up the miter attack

822
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,159
framework

823
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,200
so

824
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,480
um

825
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,880
some years ago i think

826
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,480
lockheed martin or somebody else came up

827
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,240
with a cyber kill chain

828
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,080
idea and and by the way this this

829
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,640
stuff's not you know new this is this is

830
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,600
how

831
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,840
attackers are getting it began been

832
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,240
getting into systems for years if you go

833
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,360
back to reading i think 1999 or 2000

834
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,120
hacking exposed

835
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,240
um george mcclure and stuart kirk

836
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,600
george kirk's

837
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,200
some of these guys stuart mcclure i

838
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,039
can't remember all the guys that were on

839
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,640
that book but they talked about this

840
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,120
very thing um and what we just said

841
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,480
earlier you're always going to be

842
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,880
looking around for a way to get in

843
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,320
you're going to

844
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,960
get a foothold of initial access through

845
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,720
either phishing social engineering

846
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,520
remote desktop misconfiguration or

847
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,840
taking advantage of some public facing

848
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,200
system uh you know there's other ways to

849
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,039
like you've seen the one before where

850
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,080
you know you put some malware on a usb

851
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,480
memory stick and then you write on there

852
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,279
oh here's the ceo salary or whatever and

853
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,640
you leave it in the parking lot somebody

854
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,080
comes and picks it up puts in their

855
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,279
computer now

856
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,200
they've uh they've launched malware on

857
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,880
their system

858
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,640
um there's different ways to get that

859
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,799
initial access and then you want to gain

860
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,559
you know persistence or back door for

861
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,520
later on you want to escalate privileges

862
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,039
because you don't want to just be

863
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,559
an unprivileged user you want to have

864
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,360
admin or root level privileges

865
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,120
defensive agent means you're going to

866
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,320
try to shut down their antivirus or

867
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,559
turn off any kind of analysis tools i

868
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,360
saw recently that the

869
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,279
one of the ransomware

870
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,120
types i can't remember which one it was

871
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,200
i think it was the r e v our reveal

872
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,480
barbie vehicle whatever it was would

873
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,520
actually if it saw that you tried to

874
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,159
turn on ida pro which is a reverse

875
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,480
engineering you know um

876
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,880
binary analysis tool it would try to

877
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,120
kill that instance or the process from

878
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,279
running to keep it from

879
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,440
keep you from running that tool

880
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,919
um credential access this is basically

881
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,399
uh you know scraping memory for

882
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,399
passwords one of the tools you see out

883
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,240
there a lot of mini cats it's used for

884
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,279
that

885
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,960
lateral movement is moving around within

886
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,880
the environment to try to spread from

887
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,480
computer to computer

888
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,840
uh collection

889
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840
is you know going and finding important

890
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,279
data so they're looking for product

891
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,159
plans intellectual property financials

892
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,520
uh personal identifiable data

893
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,159
um credit card numbers whatever

894
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,919
and then they're going to as we said

895
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,399
establish command control to an external

896
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,000
site this can allow them to keep

897
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,640
updating you know getting more stuff

898
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,080
exfiltrating the data is you know

899
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,480
scaling all the data out to a to a cloud

900
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,039
or some other place and then finally

901
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,279
impact is you know doing bad stuff like

902
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,039
encrypting all your files

903
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,240
um deleting files shutting down systems

904
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,039
denial service so

905
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,960
as you can see on the right

906
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,840
um

907
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,919
here's just some examples of how you

908
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,960
know maze ransomware does what it does

909
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,520
um it creates persistence by scheduling

910
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,480
a batch file in your startup folder

911
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,600
um it turns off uh you know dynamic

912
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,320
analysis tools like like i said before i

913
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,600
think it's item

914
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
ida pro

915
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,000
it scrapes passwords using many cats if

916
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,840
you're not familiar with that tool

917
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,880
mimikatz is really powerful

918
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,120
whenever you log into a windows system

919
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,039
it caches

920
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,000
your user id and password in plain text

921
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,360
in ram

922
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,960
and so that's a tool that will scrape

923
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,720
ram memory to go get passwords uh out of

924
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,919
there

925
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,200
um

926
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,600
ps exec and powershell are tools you

927
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,919
know admin tools that are used for

928
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,080
uh moving laterally and to execute you

929
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,880
know commands over the network inside a

930
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,399
microsoft environment windows

931
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:35,679
environment

932
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,519
um for command and control you know we

933
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,000
could find hard-coded ips

934
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,200
through um in the code for uh you know

935
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,000
http communication so it would look like

936
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,200
basically

937
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,840
regular web communications and traffic

938
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,399
on port 80 but it's really um

939
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,480
you know belies the fact that there's

940
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,919
uh you know

941
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,720
commands being sent back and forth

942
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,799
for staging the data to be stolen we

943
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,840
always see them use tools like 7-zip or

944
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,120
winrar

945
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,399
or and then win scp for ftp

946
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,399
data out to cloud

947
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,440
um

948
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,840
as a little nasty side thing it does it

949
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,919
deletes your shadow volume so if you're

950
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,519
not familiar with shadow volumes on

951
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,760
windows what they do is um they try to

952
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,880
create

953
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,480
restore points

954
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,440
um in snapshots so that if like you ever

955
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,880
have the blue screen of death you know

956
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,559
after you install a program

957
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,000
and you're like oh man i wish i could

958
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,240
get back to a state where before i blue

959
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,679
screen well you can

960
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,240
uh by restoring you know booting to safe

961
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,360
mode and then restoring the system os

962
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,519
back to where you were before your blue

963
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,480
screen

964
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,240
well you can't do that if they delete

965
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,720
your shadow volumes and turn off the

966
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,480
shadow volume service

967
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,440
um

968
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,919
you can't be very hard to recover um and

969
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,279
then they do things like stop your

970
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,960
database service so they can encrypt the

971
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,600
database server i mean really really

972
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,279
nasty but these are all things that can

973
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,039
be watched for

974
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:01,919
uh

975
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,679
that's what we do as a company and

976
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:04,880
there's other companies out there that

977
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,880
will do this and there's you know

978
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,399
certainly organizations can run their

979
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,279
own security operations services

980
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,679
um you know but you get you got to find

981
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,000
the people right you're gonna have to

982
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,320
you need at least i would say two people

983
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,720
per shift around the clock 24 7. so

984
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,480
that's like six people plus you need you

985
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,200
know

986
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,519
experienced threat hunters

987
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,360
there's usually tears of analysts so

988
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,679
tier one is like the eyes on glass

989
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,559
people

990
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,559
watching the matrix you know 24 7 and

991
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,640
then tier two are the people that come

992
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,039
in they're more advanced supervisory and

993
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,120
and uh determine if an escalation needs

994
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,120
to be made when something is found and

995
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,799
then tier three are your advanced threat

996
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,159
hunters

997
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,399
who will you know figure out how to stop

998
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,120
the problem get to the bottom of it and

999
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,679
eradicate it so you really need all that

1000
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,080
stuff um and so you know as you can

1001
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,919
imagine most companies

1002
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,000
even a billion dollar company

1003
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,240
is probably not going to

1004
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,320
put put out the money for

1005
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,919
an eight to ten person security

1006
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,960
operations team um

1007
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,119
it's it when you can get the equivalent

1008
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,199
of that for you know a fraction of cost

1009
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,599
from some outsourced provider right so

1010
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,280
it's usually a good idea for these

1011
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,679
companies to just outsource that

1012
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,679
all right so this is a notional idea of

1013
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,560
what you know one client might look like

1014
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,320
so here we have the analysts that are

1015
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,520
you know wherever they are they're in a

1016
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,199
security operations center or there

1017
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,960
might be working remote

1018
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,280
they're all um connecting into uh you

1019
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,119
know a vsoc

1020
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,760
you have an updated threat feed

1021
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
you're getting um you're getting logs

1022
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,800
from

1023
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,159
uh 0.365 and azure and aws and india

1024
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,879
cloud you're getting um you're getting

1025
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,000
logs from you know on-premises servers

1026
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,239
virtualization servers any kind of you

1027
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,879
know financial software they're running

1028
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,719
um every site is going to have its own

1029
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,119
security stack with a firewall endpoint

1030
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,280
protection email security and all that

1031
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,520
stuff this can all be fed in you know

1032
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,359
the logs of this can be fed into this

1033
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,280
one aggregation server

1034
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,880
and then you run these like

1035
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,800
pre-configured correlation rules it gets

1036
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,320
updated with a threat feed every 15

1037
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,560
minutes or so and it bubbles up these

1038
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,960
alerts that these people then

1039
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
determine if they need to be escalated

1040
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,560
the alerts are going to be the things

1041
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,240
that we just showed on the previous

1042
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,280
slide

1043
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,320
you know

1044
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,200
it's an alert about oh i just saw i just

1045
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,520
saw somebody going to a fake phishing

1046
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,359
website can you we can see that in real

1047
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,359
time because we see them get redirected

1048
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,000
to a domain that looks exactly like the

1049
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,920
regular real domain but it's off by like

1050
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,359
one character

1051
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,440
and it's in http so we can see them

1052
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,800
inputting their credentials into this

1053
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,079
site that looks like the real one but

1054
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,520
it's fake

1055
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,599
um we can see command and control

1056
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,520
traffic happening you know from from

1057
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,760
these known you know blacklisted sites

1058
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,119
we can see

1059
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,640
um people trying to do privilege

1060
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,480
escalation and turn off you know

1061
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
antivirus and all these things have have

1062
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,079
a signature of the um ioc the indicator

1063
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,960
of compromise that allows us to stop it

1064
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,880
as early as possible in the kill chain

1065
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,800
before it gets to the bottom of the

1066
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,160
chain near the impact level

1067
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,839
all right so um

1068
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,160
quickly moving on topics here

1069
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,800
one of the hot kind of things i've been

1070
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,880
um researching lately and because

1071
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,800
we've been seeing it come up in some of

1072
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,040
our digital forensics incident response

1073
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,480
work

1074
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,440
is um ssl vpns so

1075
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,839
the background is

1076
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:34,800
um

1077
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,280
you know ford fortigate fortinet and

1078
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,119
some others um

1079
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,240
put out some firewall updates recently

1080
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,480
and and all these all these firewalls

1081
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,160
have it whether using watchguard

1082
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,599
checkpoint

1083
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,760
fortinet palo alto

1084
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,839
cisco um

1085
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,520
whatever you're using

1086
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,200
pulse secure

1087
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
they all have they all want to have some

1088
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,040
kind of web interface that allows you to

1089
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,880
do remote configuration of the firewall

1090
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,160
and they all want to have some sort of

1091
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,599
ssl vpn capability because

1092
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,000
as opposed to layer two

1093
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,680
uh vpn ssl is very easy to to manage and

1094
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,079
integrate it's all part of your your web

1095
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,839
services stack

1096
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,200
and so

1097
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,760
these firewall manufacturers will try to

1098
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,400
put together

1099
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,720
a um

1100
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,359
a web services interface

1101
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,000
and what they do is they usually go

1102
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,839
back

1103
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,079
to um some old version of apache right

1104
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,920
they just it just take some old

1105
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,280
uh you know

1106
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,480
2001 2002 era apache

1107
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,200
and modify it to be part of their

1108
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,320
firewall

1109
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,040
user interface well

1110
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
as you can imagine people that play

1111
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,320
capture the flag

1112
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,400
and do this stuff for a living and find

1113
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,280
bugs

1114
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,720
uh see these

1115
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,359
ssl vpns as slot machines from a bug

1116
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,560
bounty perspective now the people i'm

1117
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,160
talking about um

1118
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,200
orange sai and um meh chang

1119
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,079
are like the best of the best right they

1120
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,160
um orange just won

1121
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,839
to own which is

1122
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,280
um if you go to cansec west

1123
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,119
uh security conference

1124
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,040
um they have a cone to own competition

1125
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,359
where people bring their zero days for

1126
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,560
you know windows uh

1127
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,160
mac os

1128
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,400
ios um chrome

1129
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,800
firefox whatever and the and these

1130
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,040
vendors will pay them money

1131
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,680
for um showing how they can

1132
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,400
you know own or compromise these systems

1133
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,320
in real time so these are these are

1134
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,640
unannounced undiscovered zero-day

1135
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,280
attacks that people bring with them

1136
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,640
and um

1137
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,599
orange

1138
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,920
uh and his team brought like a zero day

1139
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,320
for microsoft microsoft exchange server

1140
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,240
this year and completely owned it and

1141
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,680
ended up winning

1142
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,920
you know a big um

1143
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,680
money in you know the most points in the

1144
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,599
opponent owned competition

1145
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,520
they are also um

1146
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
they play in the defcon captured flag

1147
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,560
which is considered the world

1148
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,000
championship of hacking so they kind of

1149
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,680
turn their hobby which is finding

1150
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,240
security vulnerabilities into a way that

1151
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,800
pays off you know a real a real nice

1152
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,640
salary for them

1153
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,440
or you know so

1154
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,119
um

1155
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,040
ssl vpn is

1156
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,280
why it's a big deal it's found in

1157
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,160
uh

1158
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,680
you know half a million servers on the

1159
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,560
internet

1160
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,640
uh that's just to fortigate ssl vpn

1161
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,560
that's you know that's one brand

1162
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,640
um some of the examples are you know

1163
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,359
there there's a twitter ssl vpn and

1164
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,920
there's some marvel comics sslvpn

1165
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,880
so they're out there to be found um you

1166
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,720
probably could go and show dan which is

1167
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,400
like a vulnerability search engine and

1168
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,680
find a bunch of these out there but um

1169
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,000
basically they treated it like a ctf

1170
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,960
challenge

1171
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,280
so they started out

1172
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,160
uh

1173
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,400
they first got you know a firewall and

1174
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,319
they saw the firewall image as just this

1175
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,720
big binary blob with all the symbols

1176
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,680
stripped

1177
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,359
that's very very much like a ctf

1178
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,720
challenge right a ctf challenge

1179
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,560
capture flag is where

1180
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,680
um

1181
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,040
they give you some

1182
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,800
binary they don't give you any source

1183
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,240
code for it and you have to figure out

1184
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,839
how to exploit it

1185
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:22,720
um

1186
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,119
to uh you know create a buffer overflow

1187
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,119
or you know a stack or heap overflow and

1188
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,319
then

1189
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,599
redirect

1190
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,960
um execution so you can get a shell

1191
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,480
once you have a shell then you go look

1192
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,040
for the flag or whatever it is you know

1193
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,160
the part of the challenge that has a

1194
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,359
flag

1195
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,920
well um this is the very same thing

1196
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,680
uh how did all you got to do is figure

1197
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,839
out how to mount that image

1198
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,240
uh get a shell and then go exploring

1199
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,400
within the unix environments or linux or

1200
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,720
whatever it is you know coded in

1201
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,520
um

1202
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,000
so what they did is um they did that

1203
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,599
very thing they figured out how to mount

1204
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,000
the image they um

1205
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,839
were able to do some reverse engineering

1206
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,359
of it with you know ida pro and some

1207
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:04,960
other tools

1208
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,480
and um

1209
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,079
figured out how to land a buffer

1210
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,359
overflow

1211
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,680
and uh you know they they want a bug

1212
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,560
bounty for that

1213
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,799
the

1214
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,599
the patch for this fortigate

1215
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,240
vp sslvpn vulnerability

1216
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,560
was issued like a year ago

1217
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,040
and yet we just still had a customer

1218
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,960
again not a managed service customer of

1219
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,280
ours but a referral from a third party

1220
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,280
uh that was using that deprecated

1221
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,040
firewall software

1222
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,040
um and it's that's another lesson is

1223
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,079
like when you're going to do your

1224
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,119
updates

1225
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,200
don't just think windows updates

1226
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,480
remember

1227
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,240
you've got firewall firmware that needs

1228
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,319
to be updated on a regular basis server

1229
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,280
firmware virtualization software remote

1230
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,839
access software server access software

1231
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,000
these are all kind of shadow areas of

1232
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,359
updates that people don't consider

1233
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,880
sometimes when they're just thinking

1234
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,680
about

1235
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,480
you know

1236
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,640
patching windows so there's lots of

1237
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,079
other places that need to be patched as

1238
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,160
well and as it has to be part of your

1239
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,119
vulnerability management program

1240
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,599
so what they found is um

1241
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,560
uh

1242
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,319
people would add these native script

1243
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,000
language extensions

1244
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,560
uh which caused lots of problems

1245
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,640
um it was based on

1246
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,359
very very old apache code as i mentioned

1247
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,280
uh they're able to do

1248
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,520
um directory traversal attacks which

1249
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,440
means that they could um

1250
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,839
create a buffer

1251
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:30,720
overflow um

1252
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,640
escape out you know dot dot slash dot

1253
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,240
dot out of the

1254
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,920
directory they're in into another

1255
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,000
directory which would allow them to then

1256
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,440
read files

1257
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,200
one of the files they found

1258
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,920
uh is for whatever reason the ssl vpn

1259
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,319
implementation that was part of the

1260
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,680
linux stack

1261
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,240
uh was was saving anybody who had logged

1262
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,920
into the into the firewall it would save

1263
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,400
their user id and password in plain text

1264
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,760
in the logs

1265
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,880
so they just had to figure out how to

1266
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,800
get to that

1267
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,480
and they were able to do

1268
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,280
an exploitation a heap overflow you know

1269
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,599
before authentication

1270
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,359
where they would just simply send some

1271
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,680
cert you know certain crafted

1272
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,480
um strings to the firewall and get it

1273
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,319
into a state where they could crash it

1274
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,720
and allow them to go read

1275
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,079
this file that would give them the

1276
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,280
passwords

1277
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,599
and as i said uh this customer we were

1278
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,200
doing the forensics for

1279
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,359
hadn't updated their their software

1280
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,400
their firewall firmware

1281
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,760
so when we're trying to help them clean

1282
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,280
up from this

1283
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,240
um

1284
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,319
you know this ransomware attack we kept

1285
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,000
seeing the attacker

1286
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,440
getting back into their system and we're

1287
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,960
like man we changed everything we

1288
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,480
thought we kicked them out and we

1289
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,560
finally figured out it was from the fact

1290
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,839
that they were up exploiting the

1291
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,880
firewall vpn service so that's why we

1292
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,480
that's why i was like man this is this

1293
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
is a huge issue that's out there and

1294
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,119
something i i would say we see another

1295
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,200
one of these you know issues coming up

1296
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,960
every few months so keep your eye out

1297
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,200
for it

1298
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,319
um

1299
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,440
i think

1300
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,040
uh i'm going to quickly move through

1301
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,640
this so i can get to the to the

1302
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,200
questions part but um a lot of people

1303
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,359
ask you know what can we do

1304
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,680
with ai and cyber security and as you

1305
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,480
know

1306
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,079
you know if you're taking any classes in

1307
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,119
this

1308
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,160
um

1309
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,280
ai is

1310
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,400
mimicking human abilities to

1311
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,680
analyze data learn recognize objects

1312
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,520
make decisions solve problems and so

1313
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,410
forth

1314
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,920
[Music]

1315
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,119
so

1316
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,200
what we hear out there is oh man you've

1317
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,599
got to have ai to be able to combat ai

1318
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,280
and i hear this from some of the ai

1319
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,560
vendors you know

1320
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,480
um there's some really good tools out

1321
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,400
there like dark trace is one that you

1322
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,560
might have heard about that is that does

1323
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,000
kind of anomalous

1324
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,680
intrusion detection

1325
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,400
so whereas i was showing you sim

1326
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,920
before security information event

1327
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,240
management which is based on

1328
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,760
rules and

1329
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,520
signatures and looking for for specific

1330
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,400
uh

1331
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,400
attacks that we've seen before

1332
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,640
an ai intrusion detection system is

1333
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,800
going to more look for patternless or

1334
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,640
anomalous types of behavior so it's

1335
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,520
going to

1336
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,280
kind of understand the steady state of

1337
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,880
an environment and then if it ever sees

1338
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,200
any perturbation or

1339
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,280
um you know behavior that's out of out

1340
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,280
of range then it will you know schedule

1341
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,319
an alert

1342
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,800
um and so we hear from these ai vendors

1343
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,720
that oh man you've got to have rai

1344
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,200
because people are attacking with ai

1345
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,319
systems

1346
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,280
but the ai reality is that you know seen

1347
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,440
really any evidence of adversarial

1348
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,880
attacks in the world

1349
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,440
uh those are more you know just you know

1350
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,119
there's no concrete evidence of any of

1351
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,920
these apt or ransomware

1352
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,920
things using all

1353
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,480
ai and machine learning attacks

1354
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,520
that's not

1355
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,119
they can't or they won't

1356
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,800
or that it's not coming i'm just saying

1357
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,359
that's i kind of haven't seen it myself

1358
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,200
here

1359
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,280
again i'm working with

1360
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,680
you know mid-market enterprises that's

1361
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,079
that's the sweet spot for my company

1362
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,359
um and maybe

1363
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,920
apt if they have anything in the in the

1364
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,520
machine learning

1365
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,119
capability they're not going to use that

1366
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,800
on on such a company they're going to

1367
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,200
save it for going after nation states

1368
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,079
attacking national secrets going after

1369
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,000
the really big guns where they can steal

1370
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,440
you know very valuable intellectual

1371
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,800
property who knows

1372
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,640
but we we just haven't seen it too much

1373
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,400
ourselves

1374
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,760
um

1375
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,720
you know

1376
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,920
what is a real value proposition is that

1377
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,839
it does see things faster than humans

1378
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,359
and it can help

1379
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,280
it can really go after the low-hanging

1380
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,640
fruit it can do

1381
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,280
you know crunch numbers fast

1382
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,760
so a few years ago at defcon which is a

1383
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,680
hacker conference in las vegas i'd send

1384
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,160
you know just about every year

1385
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,400
they had the cyber grand challenge which

1386
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,599
was a

1387
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,839
darpa defense advanced research projects

1388
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,839
agency sponsored

1389
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:54,880
um

1390
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,560
you know uh

1391
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,079
challenge where they

1392
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,119
invited

1393
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,960
teams to come in and create you know

1394
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,720
robots if you will artificial

1395
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,200
intelligence or you know um

1396
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,520
programs to be able to do cyber attack

1397
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,920
and defense so we they had systems that

1398
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,240
they had to try to protect themselves

1399
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,079
and determine if somebody else was

1400
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,480
attacking their systems and try to

1401
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,440
defend

1402
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,800
and they also had systems that they

1403
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,480
could attack you know they could they

1404
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,559
could attack each other

1405
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,880
and try to find exploits and then gain

1406
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,960
you know capture flags and gain points

1407
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,359
so the winner of all that was mayhem

1408
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,640
which was uh the carnegie mellon uh team

1409
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,319
and actually saw mayhem

1410
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,680
uh in

1411
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,680
in the smithsonian

1412
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,359
after that it was pretty awesome those

1413
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,359
little um those boxes up on the stage

1414
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,760
were were the actual competitors

1415
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,280
uh and they were you know autonomous the

1416
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,520
winner may have actually got to go fight

1417
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,480
uh

1418
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,480
against humans in the human

1419
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,040
captured flag competition the next day

1420
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,440
um it finished in last place

1421
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,079
but it you know it did show that there

1422
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,559
is there is a lot of potential for

1423
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,160
um utilizing

1424
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,960
uh machine learning for for solving

1425
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,720
these problems we're going to see it a

1426
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,598
lot more in the future

1427
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,640
a recommended read for you if you want

1428
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,200
to get into you know cyber security and

1429
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,680
want to understand the mindset of some

1430
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,040
of these great

1431
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,200
ethical hackers are out there

1432
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,880
um

1433
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,800
that's a copy of it you can find you can

1434
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,280
get online it's okay they um they

1435
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,440
initially put it out free of charge and

1436
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,200
allowed you to download it in a pdf

1437
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,359
format you can buy it too i guess if you

1438
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,200
wanted to

1439
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,720
donate or contribute to the cause you

1440
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,319
can get it on amazon but i think you get

1441
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,480
a free copy out there in a lot of places

1442
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,760
anyway

1443
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,359
a lot of the experts say the same basic

1444
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,119
thing which is

1445
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,280
good security comes from good people

1446
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,280
good security people not from a shiny

1447
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,440
box that does stuff right

1448
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,800
um so

1449
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,599
ai i don't see as replacing humans at

1450
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,559
this point you know human analysts i see

1451
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,480
it as a force multiplier for trained

1452
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,119
analysts um it can crunch a lot of data

1453
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,520
it can help us narrow down problem

1454
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,800
spaces

1455
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,839
um

1456
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:10,880
and

1457
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,319
you know you're still going to need

1458
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,319
people that can make sense of the alerts

1459
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,000
and follow up on the alerts and close

1460
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,680
out the alerts

1461
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,119
but um

1462
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,920
and i also would very much hesitate in

1463
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,240
allowing you know automated remediation

1464
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,440
or patching

1465
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,880
uh it is

1466
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,040
available to some extent you know what

1467
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,119
they call self-healing networks or

1468
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,040
auto-resilient networks

1469
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,319
i think i would just be worried about

1470
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,200
that because i've seen in the past that

1471
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,359
you know a system where you just apply

1472
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,000
controls without really testing them out

1473
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,680
and making sure they're working properly

1474
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,440
is a system you're gonna you're gonna

1475
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,119
break you're gonna break that system and

1476
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,260
break it and make it unusable

1477
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,880
[Music]

1478
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,960
um anybody that's ever starting in this

1479
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,720
field if you ever find yourself in a

1480
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,880
role where you're going to um have to

1481
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,400
implement controls

1482
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,640
and and address these emerging threats

1483
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,800
you need to have a plan a plan in place

1484
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,319
you need to assess

1485
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,119
your

1486
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,880
organization's posture

1487
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,720
establish continuous monitoring as i

1488
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,480
said before sim sock

1489
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,200
and also train people to be aware and

1490
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,440
not to be the weakest link

1491
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,400
so

1492
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,480
having a plan means uh executive

1493
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,000
leadership buy-in

1494
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,559
and developing you know a real plan with

1495
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,640
actions and milestones and working

1496
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,400
against that plan

1497
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,240
uh one of the big drivers we've seen

1498
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,839
lately

1499
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,680
is cyber breach insurance isn't that

1500
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,200
interesting so cyber breach insurance

1501
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,680
was supposed to be this this uh safety

1502
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,760
net this blanket safety blanket whatever

1503
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,520
you want to call it that would keep you

1504
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,760
like if you made mistakes it's okay

1505
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,119
we've got our cyber breach insurance

1506
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,680
it'll cover us in case we ever you know

1507
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,839
have any uh denial of service or lost

1508
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,880
data or whatever um it'll kick in and

1509
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,200
it'll pay out

1510
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,119
what people are getting they're getting

1511
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,880
their cyber breach insurance renewal

1512
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,960
notices now and find out finding out

1513
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,880
their premiums have gone up four or five

1514
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,280
six times and they're like holy moly

1515
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,760
this is this is really pricey now we

1516
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,440
need to do something about it and the

1517
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,200
insurance companies have kind of wised

1518
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,280
up and the underwriting has changed so

1519
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,200
that they um they're not just going to

1520
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,480
give out policies and they're not going

1521
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,160
to cover you for as much if you don't

1522
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,240
have the basics in place that was the

1523
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,599
issue

1524
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:20,800
a lot of people would fill out these

1525
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,400
applications and you're supposed to have

1526
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,400
x y and z in place to show that you have

1527
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,000
due diligence and they didn't really

1528
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,440
have it in place so they would get

1529
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,920
breached and then uh they may not get

1530
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,839
the payout if they didn't have in place

1531
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,440
what they're supposed to have in place

1532
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,760
so all this is driving price and you've

1533
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,680
got to have this stuff in place to get

1534
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,680
insurance anymore

1535
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,119
assessments are things you do on a

1536
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,800
regular basis either scanning for

1537
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,240
vulnerabilities from an external

1538
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,880
standpoint as an attacker might from the

1539
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,520
internet or inside your environment by

1540
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,440
placing you know vulnerability scanners

1541
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,440
in there and looking for missing patches

1542
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,119
of misconfigurations

1543
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,220
you also want to

1544
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,440
[Music]

1545
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,440
show compliance against a best practices

1546
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,280
framework such as the

1547
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,640
national institute of standards of

1548
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,400
technology cyber security framework for

1549
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,559
infrastructure critical infrastructure

1550
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,960
protection or the center for internet

1551
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,440
security top 20 or if you're you know

1552
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,359
processing credit cards

1553
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:16,480
pci dss there's any number of standards

1554
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,000
out there iso 27001 is another one um

1555
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,400
that there are best practices for

1556
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,160
uh your environment and you want to have

1557
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,599
an objective standard to measure

1558
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:26,880
yourself against you don't want to just

1559
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,720
say well we think we're doing the right

1560
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,920
things

1561
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,359
without you know

1562
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,480
what are you doing the right things

1563
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,440
against

1564
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,880
these are objective standards that you

1565
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,720
can utilize

1566
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,800
as i mentioned before there's always

1567
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,480
these new threats coming out there's

1568
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,160
even the issue of you can't even trust

1569
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,800
your quote trusted software anymore so

1570
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,240
you have to have layers of security in

1571
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,400
place you have to always be watching

1572
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,480
um assumption of breach i say as a new

1573
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,319
normal assume somebody's already in your

1574
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:53,280
environment

1575
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,960
how quickly you can detect that they're

1576
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,280
there and kick them out and and fix the

1577
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,400
hole

1578
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,160
so that it can't happen again that's the

1579
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,680
new normal

1580
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,079
it this is this is borne out by

1581
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,640
by the nist cyber security framework um

1582
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,319
there's basically five parts in there

1583
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,839
identify your data

1584
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,119
uh

1585
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,440
enact protections you know proactive

1586
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,359
defenses like encryption and

1587
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,680
multi-factor authentication and so forth

1588
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,000
but then that's that's only about 20 or

1589
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,240
30 percent of the of the cyber security

1590
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,720
controls in that framework the rest of

1591
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,520
it is all detection response and

1592
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,480
recovery

1593
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,359
so detection is detecting when an

1594
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,440
intruder is there

1595
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,640
uh

1596
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,960
response is kicking them out contain

1597
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,800
constraining what they can do and making

1598
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,680
sure

1599
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,839
they're eradicated from the environment

1600
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,079
and then recovery is fixing the issue so

1601
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,680
it doesn't happen again

1602
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,920
that's how we operate now because

1603
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,680
as the defenders we have to defend a

1604
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,920
thousand ways into the castle and we as

1605
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,680
we already said before it's not a castle

1606
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,839
it's more like a

1607
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,400
amoeba it's a blob

1608
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,440
everywhere

1609
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,359
uh and doing the defense is very

1610
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,319
difficult so we're going to make

1611
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:01,440
mistakes

1612
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,599
how how quickly you can detect respond

1613
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,520
and recover those are the keys

1614
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,240
to um to good security these days

1615
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,119
and finally uh making sure people are

1616
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,319
trained

1617
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,760
making sure they're empowered as the

1618
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,680
first line of defense you know they can

1619
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,680
subvert everything else we're doing we

1620
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,200
can have great firewalls endpoint

1621
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,400
protection

1622
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,520
um

1623
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,960
monitoring and everything but i can't

1624
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,480
keep somebody from

1625
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,559
giving out information over the phone

1626
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,240
and we've seen it before

1627
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,920
where somebody gets called up from the

1628
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,319
outside they're like hey um

1629
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:35,440
uh we need you know the boss wants to

1630
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,680
go get gift cards for people

1631
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,200
and you need to run to you know

1632
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,400
walgreens or cvs and buy some gift cards

1633
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,839
scratch off the numbers and give them to

1634
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,119
me so i can

1635
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,960
so the boss can give out these you know

1636
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,119
these recognition awards and the people

1637
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,599
go and do it now there's not any kind of

1638
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,520
cyber security protection i can put in

1639
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,280
place for that other than training

1640
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,880
people not to fall victim to such

1641
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,280
attacks so training education awareness

1642
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,319
of the key

1643
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,079
um when we first

1644
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:05,440
fish a company or an organization

1645
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,359
we usually can get them you know we get

1646
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,920
about 30 of the people to fall for

1647
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,000
you know as victims but once we train to

1648
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,280
people

1649
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,799
uh we can get definitely down to about

1650
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,480
two or three percent

1651
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,400
so there's definitely um things you can

1652
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,720
do through training all right so that's

1653
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,720
a lot of information in in a short

1654
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,240
amount of time

1655
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,400
i do want to open it up to

1656
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,040
some q a

1657
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,760
so question from the audience is how

1658
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,359
does your security team position itself

1659
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,440
in relation to privacy engineers with

1660
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,559
gdpr

1661
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,920
ccpa and other data privacy legislation

1662
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,839
uh assume it's become even more

1663
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,839
important to know where the user date is

1664
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:48,240
and how to secure scrub it if needed

1665
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,480
yeah absolutely um

1666
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,319
security privacy and security go hand in

1667
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,480
hand right security is what gives

1668
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,559
privacy legislation and

1669
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,440
and uh policies its teeth right

1670
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,200
um and there's a lot of considerations

1671
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,520
there so gdpr is the general data

1672
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,559
privacy regulation of the european union

1673
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,440
ccpa is california consumer privacy act

1674
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,839
uh again one of the most um you know

1675
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,920
strictest and most i guess onerous or

1676
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,920
whatever we call it uh privacy

1677
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,079
regulations in the us along with uh you

1678
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,240
know nevada and new york are also

1679
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,119
having enacted some some state laws and

1680
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,480
there's 17 other states that have

1681
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,119
pending legislation in this regard

1682
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,240
um

1683
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,440
absolutely

1684
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,880
one of the first things we want to do is

1685
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,760
just in data discovery is understand

1686
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,520
where the data are so we have tools and

1687
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,000
solutions now that can go

1688
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,359
and um

1689
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,440
scrub you know spider through an entire

1690
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,520
environment and look for unstructured

1691
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,240
data now structured data you often you

1692
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,440
know you kind of know where that is

1693
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,440
right it's in a database uh in a

1694
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,599
database server and you you know how

1695
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,200
that exists

1696
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,880
but the um

1697
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,040
but unstructured data that's much harder

1698
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,200
to find because it can be in emails it

1699
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,040
can be in presentations it could be in

1700
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,280
little excel spreadsheets it can be in

1701
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,880
staged data that's getting ready to go

1702
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,640
into the database it could be all over

1703
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,400
the place on people's desktops on their

1704
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,599
hard drives

1705
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,040
in the cloud

1706
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,040
and so finding that data and getting

1707
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,280
control over it is super important

1708
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,079
we do have methods for that and we can

1709
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,480
do what's called metadata tagging so

1710
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,640
once we discover where that data exists

1711
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,920
and resides

1712
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,480
we can put a label in there that says

1713
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,720
hey this is gdpr data

1714
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,520
then

1715
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,640
then you know how to treat it in the

1716
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,960
environment um if it's not if it's in a

1717
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,240
place where it's not supposed to be on

1718
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,880
somebody's desktop you can eradicate it

1719
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,559
there leave a stub and say hey this has

1720
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,119
been moved over to the gdpr place then

1721
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,760
the gdpr folder can have special access

1722
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,760
controls multi-factor authentication and

1723
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,760
monitoring to make sure you're doing

1724
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,559
access data rights management on that

1725
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:53,040
you can also apply this metadata tagging

1726
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,040
to what's called dlp data loss

1727
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,880
prevention which is a solution that

1728
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,400
keeps the data from

1729
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,400
exiting the environment without

1730
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,319
you know going through a secure channel

1731
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:05,760
such as an encrypted envelope

1732
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,520
so that's a good question those go hand

1733
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,119
in hand and you know we definitely are

1734
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,880
have to have to work with those privacy

1735
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,200
folks

1736
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:19,280
[Music]

1737
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,680
any other questions

1738
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:26,000
[Music]

1739
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,440
how would you recommend somebody learn

1740
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,640
earthquaking red teaming

1741
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:35,558
funny you should ask right joel

1742
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,400
as a matter of fact we're doing um some

1743
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,200
red teaming training for uh through

1744
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,760
purdue sirius for another organization

1745
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,720
uh right now so what we're gonna do

1746
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,960
is we're gonna have a seminar section

1747
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,559
where we talk about some red teaming

1748
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:51,599
techniques

1749
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,040
and then we're going to have a little

1750
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,680
capture the flag

1751
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,640
exercise or competition to test out the

1752
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,880
skills of the people participating so

1753
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,280
i'd say that's how i recommend doing it

1754
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,000
get involved in ctfs capture the flag

1755
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,760
there's online ones that run all the

1756
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,440
time so there's websites you know kind

1757
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,000
of hack the site websites um that will

1758
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,480
allow you to try out your skills and

1759
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,839
they'll usually start you out with some

1760
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,920
low-hanging fruit some easy challenges

1761
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,119
and then you're gonna have to learn more

1762
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:20,400
and more to work your way up to the

1763
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,400
harder and harder challenges and there's

1764
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,920
different types of skills you need to

1765
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,440
pick up

1766
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,280
networking skills

1767
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,559
you know just

1768
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,000
you know how to use your command line

1769
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,680
how to use a terminal

1770
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,400
to

1771
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,119
ssh connect to other servers and run

1772
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,760
netcat and nmap and other tools like

1773
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,319
that those are not necessarily

1774
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:41,440
i don't know if you're picking up those

1775
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,760
skills or not in your classes if not

1776
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,680
these are things you can pick up on your

1777
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,960
own through self-study and screen time

1778
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,200
um there's web exploitation things you

1779
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,160
know cross-site scripting sql injection

1780
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,960
cross-site request forgery and uh things

1781
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,040
like that you can figure out how to do

1782
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,880
there's those are there's websites that

1783
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,960
will train you on that kind of stuff so

1784
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,559
i would say um

1785
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,240
you know outside

1786
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,920
outside the classroom

1787
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,359
there you know you can join the purdue

1788
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,119
security you know hacking ethical

1789
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,440
hacking club and get involved with ctfs

1790
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,480
with them

1791
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,400
or you can do it on your own

1792
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,640
um through these websites that offer you

1793
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,680
know

1794
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,280
ethical hacking challenges and that's

1795
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,640
how you're going to hone your skills

1796
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,200
outside the classroom in the classroom

1797
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,040
you know we can only give you so much in

1798
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,920
terms of theory lab exercises and things

1799
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,040
like that

1800
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,359
but it's it's your own screen time

1801
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:34,640
that's going to help you improve those

1802
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,650
red teaming skills

1803
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:39,849
[Music]

1804
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,078
any other questions

1805
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:57,680
y'all put up uh we have our own um

1806
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,839
usf has its uh our white hatters club

1807
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:02,799
has its own ctf practice range

1808
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,990
i can put up a copy of that let's see

1809
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:06,160
[Music]

1810
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,960
if i can find it

1811
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,640
keep asking questions if you have any

1812
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:23,119
[Music]

1813
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,440
well

1814
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,839
um

1815
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:36,400
yeah i found it

1816
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,720
uh

1817
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,799
try this one out from usf

1818
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,720
if you ever have time you can create an

1819
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,400
account there and

1820
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,839
um

1821
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:49,359
try out our our hacking website

1822
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:50,880
but with that i guess and no other

1823
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,480
questions um

1824
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,240
thanks for having me again as always

1825

i'll be here again 12 years from now

1826
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,480
for my next session

1827
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,520
let's make it six let's make it six

1828

that'd be awesome

1830
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,720
with the evolution of the industry and

1831
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,160
the things that you're working on jeremy

1832

01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,319
thoughts not only with our students who

1837
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,640
are taking this for credit class but by

1838
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,079
the uh thousands who turn in each week

1839

uh or uh view our recordings in the

1840
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,640
years to come

1841
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,480
so those of you who are interested to

1842
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,480
hear what jeremy had to talk about 12

1843
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,640
years ago you can go look up that old

1844
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,920
video as well uh i think i'm not sure if
