1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,639
we are delighted to come back to sirius

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,798
this year to continue our journey

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:07,600
through

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,920
technologies that we developed over the

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,599
last several years

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,840
um the first one is called structured

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,160
data folding with transmutations

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,359
it is a secure messaging protocol

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,800
and then the second

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,480
technology that we discussed last year

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,560
was encrypted user data transit and

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,599
storage

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,640
and it was a complex data structure that

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,560
basically formed what we called a nut

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,840
container

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,399
this year we're going to show you

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,280
a nuts ecosystem that uses sdft and nuts

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,440
as a foundational layer

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,000
to enable this system and it's an

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,440
example of a data centric ecosystem

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,239
where

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,160
it's all about the data

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,120
and i am yoon al

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,640
the inventor of nuts uh nsdft

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,760
and i have with us so tyrios trantafilou

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,239
who will actually be um

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,559
operating the demonstrations

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,320
and showing us how this nut ecosystem

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,320
functions

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,640
i'd like to introduce our special guest

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,680

71
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,360
that's quite a list

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,760
on a personal note it was about five

73
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,480
years ago that i first met bob at a

74
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,680
cocktail party during dc cyber week

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,120
throughout the evening

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,599
bob kept coming back with curiously good

77
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,360
questions about nuts

78
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,120
so eventually we decided to meet for

79
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,680
lunch a couple of days later

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,440
it was at that lunch

81
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,599
the full weight of bob's service to the

82
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,040
country

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,959
and expertise in cyber security was

84
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,680
revealed and ever since then

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,239
it has been my honor

86
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,040
to know this patriot who continues to

87
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,239
play a part

88
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,319
in keeping our country safe

89
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,679
welcome dr banks

90
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,400
thank you very much and truly the

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,360
the privilege is mine to have um

92
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,720
you know

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,799
learn so much from

94
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,120
the opportunities as well as

95
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,599
you know uh the research that i've been

96
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,440
doing that has led me in the direction

97
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,319
to you

98
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,319
know as we we talked about my background

99
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,640
is one of curiosity i'm an industrial

100
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,760
engineer

101
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,120
cyber security is not just technology

102
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,519
but the process the economic incentives

103
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,439
which motivate people towards

104
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,000
alternative solutions

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,480
my washington cyber opportunity

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,400
had more tax in that year than all the

107
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,879
previous years combined

108
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,480
my research over several years have led

109
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,000
me to focus

110
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,200
on cyber economics

111
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,799
because i was just unsatisfied with the

112
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,399
answers that i had and

113
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,839
my pre-doctoral research uncovered um dr

114
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,160
arthur pal which you see his diagram

115
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,280
right here

116
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,639
um

117
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,639
you know he is a principal scientist at

118
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,639
bbn raytheon

119
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,720
and he talks about the generation of

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,280
cyber research

121
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,199
and at that time you know we were in the

122
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,040
third generation and i was in the big

123
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,000
board views of attacks just tolerating

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,160
all the attacks

125
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,520
i also got

126
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,600
in that research i got to meet a john

127
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,320
streifer he was the director of federal

128
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,040
national resiliency for continuous

129
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,280
diagnostics monitoring

130
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,320
which was my role there at you know army

131
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,600
cyber

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,160
i also met up with lieutenant colonel

133
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,199
ron

134
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,400
ross doctor at nist who led the phd

135
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,520
i'm sorry sps 853

136
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,759
publications which is still very

137
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,639
prevalent today

138
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,840
in intrusion tolerance i got to back

139
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
brief the lieutenant general three star

140
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
bob elder who stood up air force cyber

141
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,720
command

142
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,400
and he kind of jokingly told them he

143
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,199
says bob i want on your phd committee

144
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,080
because

145
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,919
you have the ability to explain highly

146
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,960
classified programs in plain language

147
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,720
that even i as a general could

148
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,960
understand why it's important and what

149
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,919
the program benefits was and and folks i

150
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,080
was just trying to understand what's

151
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,560
going to work what's not going to work

152
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,479
but but that still not satisfied

153
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,199
that has led me um

154
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,600
towards a philosophical view of the

155
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,160
problem where ross anderson defined it

156
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,400
as misaligned incentives information

157
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,680
asymmetrics and externalities

158
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,680
uh so okay how do you measure it

159
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,600
well you can look at the volume the

160
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,639
velocity the variations the veracity for

161
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,759
data at rest motion many forms and data

162
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,000
and dot well at rest

163
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,479
the hp study will tell you that data is

164
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,560
doubling

165
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,720
the verizon reports attackers are

166
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,600
successful um

167
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,759
80 or 90 percent of the time where we

168
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,960
only detect 20 percent

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,800
the semantic report 2015 showed over 430

170
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,080
million unique malwares or 2.6 million

171
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,880
unique web attacks every day

172
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,440
ibm defines most attacks even a year

173
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,319
later as unknown so my mit presentations

174
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,280
i ask

175
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,680
what's the equations for these unknowns

176
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,400
who's writing 2.6 million

177
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,840
unique scripts every day

178
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
so this led to the current generation of

179
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,800
cyber security uh where mit's lincoln

180
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,400
lab staff scientist dr hammond okra

181
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,840
rava

182
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,319
wrote the survey of the moving target

183
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,479
defense where he's trying to make it

184
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,360
difficult for the attackers

185
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,680
they have networks of dynamic host

186
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,280
configurations

187
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,880
platforms for rotating servers virtual

188
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,400
virtual servers

189
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,560
run time where the address space or the

190
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,759
layout is randomized but yet the

191
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,680
challenge still comes from the software

192
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,280
and the data

193
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,800
because of the benef because of

194
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,919
trying to randomize that

195
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,000
you lose the benefit of language

196
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,160
standardization

197
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,400
so obvious obvioscations or making it

198
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,800
more difficult requires more overhead

199
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,879
and costs

200
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,759
dr oak herrera defines moving target

201
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,000
defense as speed ups obscuration

202
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
but the challenge of completeness still

203
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,199
remains

204
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,680
they are siloed defenses as part of a

205
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,120
defense

206
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,360
and enterprise subject to the weakest

207
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,879
link

208
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,039
while we defend vertically

209
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,120
we communicate horizontally

210
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,960
we need a more complete solution

211
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,199
i think we need to define

212
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,120
the fifth generation

213
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,400
of security for data security

214
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,800
examples could be blockchain of a public

215
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,960
ledger and proof of the works

216
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,719
methodology to support supply chain

217
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,799
message flow which uses the data or the

218
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,159
business process for the insider threat

219
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,560
and it performs at micro speeds

220
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,200
now one of my favorite conversations was

221
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
on trade policies because

222
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,720
i took

223
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,240
a distinguished professor of

224
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,760
international trade stuart malware

225
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,880
and

226
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,839
general hayden's construct for

227
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,760
a forward way to

228
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,160
afford looking way to address the the

229
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,080
problem and it gets back to the

230
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,000
misaligned incentives of using

231
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,640
exterminalities

232
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,720
um

233
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,440
but

234
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,200
that solution of trade agreements

235
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,360
whatever it's not going to happen you

236
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,080
know

237
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,640
anytime soon so but there are

238
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,279
developments being it's being discussed

239
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,240
there are

240
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,760
publications that are coming out and

241
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
actually a book of you know cyber

242
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,240
operations from a legal point of view so

243
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
there is development moving but that

244
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,880
takes time

245
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,560
so

246
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,399
but what this leads me towards is this

247
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,680
this

248
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,320
asymmetric anomaly

249
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,240
that covers a large patch of data

250
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,880
security's overarching needs

251
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,640
you know for the real market and the

252
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,040
developing markets kovitz business is

253
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,440
now requiring security for increased use

254
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,480
of you know work at home ransomware

255
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,160
where they attack the data security

256
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,240
which this type of technology can help

257
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,440
rebuild it

258
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
because you're not centrally located but

259
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,040
you could take advantage of the

260
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,959
decentralized nature of the network

261
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,720
you know

262
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,040
this approach is rare because the

263
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,720
technologies in terms of the

264
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,200
bio-inspired that's

265
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,760
actually quite accurately more than just

266
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
a marketing slogan

267
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,480
so in in turns i'm very grateful for the

268
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,720
opportunity to learn what this product

269
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,240
does

270
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,399
where it's going in direction because

271
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,640
i believe it gets back towards the three

272
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,680
questions

273
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,720
that

274
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,519
uh dr ron uh ross anderson is saying

275
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,519
you know in terms of that the

276
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,680
misalignment sentence the information's

277
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,240
asymmetrics and the exterminalities and

278
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,640
lots i just want to close that

279
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,760
i have bookmarked these presentations so

280
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,959
um i intend to uh partake in many others

281
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,000
in the future because i think your

282
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,079
approach you know goes beyond just the

283
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,560
technologies but brings in the

284
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,959
frameworks that we're currently using

285
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,079
brings in some of the legal concerns um

286
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,000
because again i do not believe that the

287
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,560
challenge in cyber is purely

288
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,399
technical i think that the process and

289
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,560
the economics have to be considered

290
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,959
thank you for your time

291
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,680
thank you bob for uh joining us today

292
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,320
and giving us that great overview

293
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,079
of the feel from your unique vantage

294
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,160
point

295
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,000
and now we'll just continue with the

296
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,920
rest of the technical demonstration that

297
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,040
we're going to show you today

298
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,480
a simple question is to say what started

299
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,399
all of this

300
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,120
why did we create nuts why was nuts

301
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,200
necessary in our minds

302
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,959
and some of the questions that led to

303
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,200
that are things like how do i secure the

304
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,519
work files on my home pc how do i email

305
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,600
this attachment securely

306
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,880
um

307
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,959
you know how do i stop the admin from

308
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,519
seeing his pink slip um

309
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,120
how do i stop the cloud provider from

310
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,519
reading my stuff um

311
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,200
what happens to my files on the cloud if

312
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,880
they get hacked how do i recover from

313
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,160
ransomware

314
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,560
how do i minimize my email spam and

315
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,720
there's there's plenty more questions

316
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,680
you know

317
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,440
why am i always comparing files for the

318
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,399
most recent version um

319
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,920
if you've ever asked any of these

320
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,240
questions on the left-hand box

321
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,399
um they lead to

322
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,880
various technical terminologies that

323
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,560
have been

324
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,120
put out in this field of cyber security

325
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,720
and data management

326
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,959
and some of these are listed here on the

327
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,240
right side

328
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,720
and these are very

329
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,240
wide-ranging topics and terminologies

330
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
and they each have

331
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,320
various specializations it is a

332
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,360
complicated question

333
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,839
our solution to all those questions uh

334
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,519
or our attempt

335
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,760
is to

336
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
create a decentralized and distributed

337
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,800
system

338
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,680
that at the core is all about security

339
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,279
and making sharing easy

340
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,200
nuts is a bio-inspired system and we

341
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,399
propose that dna is data

342
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,839
and that

343
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,720
if dna is data then your body and all

344
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,240
the cells involved is a data model

345
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,079
and from that we

346
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,920
try to extract the

347
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,399
operating principles of the data model

348
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,360
and

349
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,320
design nuts around it to kind of mimic

350
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,519
that

351
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,160
so what we found out is that when you do

352
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,200
this

353
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,040
and you'll see it

354
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,600
today is that

355
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,920
that the ecosystem actually makes

356
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,839
computers work the way you think they

357
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,839
should

358
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,440
so when we take a look at

359
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,320
what drives the nuts ecosystem

360
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,639
there are three components to it

361
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,199
at the heart of it is an immutable data

362
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,040
container that is secure

363
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,279
and we call that a nut file or a nut

364
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,519
container

365
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,440
it has one or maybe more payloads and

366
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,360
it can contain anything that you want

367
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
whether it's text files you know word

368
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,639
documents

369
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,680
spreadsheets entire databases or even

370
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,920
folders doesn't really matter or file

371
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,160
system

372
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,839
and then what we

373
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,399
mentioned before is that we put in a lot

374
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,880
of metadata that's protected

375
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,720
some of it is clear tech some of it is

376
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,680
not

377
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,800
and

378
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,440
these characteristics are

379
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,560
extracted from how dna operates in a dna

380
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,079
data model and we put that into each nut

381
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,760
separately

382
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,800
so every nut container therefore nut

383
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,600
file has various protective metadata

384
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,959
that could help it

385
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,079
navigate

386
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,399
and

387
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,120
kind of enforce

388
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,079
and ask to be handled in such a way

389
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,399
and then the third part is

390
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,279
the organization of these nut containers

391
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,160
so we created systems

392
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,480
and sets of applications

393
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,560
that managed to

394
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,440
you know

395
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,199
deal with these nuts across diverse

396
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,839
environments

397
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,760
there are four parties in our demo that

398
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,519
is set up as follows

399
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,639
we have rachel the real estate agent

400
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,639
we have a buyer and seller named bob and

401
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,079
sally

402
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,000
and we have a banker named fred from

403
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,560
first bank

404
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,480
each virtual machine in this demo has an

405
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,240
up browser installed

406
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,839
and when you install the not browse on a

407
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,920
set of your devices we call this a nut

408
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,199
ecosystem

409
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,279
or you may also hear us using the term

410
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,000
eco group

411
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,320
and in this example here we have four

412
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,519
equal groups one for each party member

413
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,199
the notebook that runs on your devices

414
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,120
in your eco group is actually comprised

415
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,759
of four underlying applications

416
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,040
the notebook

417
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,199
itself which is a contact password and

418
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,279
key management system

419
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,120
the nut browser which is a user

420
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,639
interface for your net files a nut

421
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,040
server which manages all the local nut

422
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,000
files within your device and your eco

423
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,120
group

424
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,440
and the rendezvous server slash the nut

425
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,480
router

426
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,279
we discussed earlier but this is a small

427
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,480
local version

428
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,639
that decides whether uh internet files

429
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,320
need to stay within your eco group or it

430
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,639
needs to find other party members and

431
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,680
send the file to them

432
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,959
let's introduce you to the net browser

433
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,680
it's your ui it's the nuts equal groups

434
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
first you have your quick action buttons

435
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,680
at the top for your common functions

436
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,360
that you could access

437
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,120
you have your folder navigator on the

438
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,839
left so we call them fogs they're smart

439
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,720
folders that manage smart shortcut links

440
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,480
uh here you'll have your workspace this

441
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,000
is where you actively be working with

442
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,519
your nut files

443
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,560
to the right of that you have your

444
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,160
metadata window where you can access the

445
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,399
metadata of the nut itself

446
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,800
below you have your secure peer-to-peer

447
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,720
chat window where you can send secure

448
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
chat messages

449
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,640
and lastly on the top you have your

450
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,480
progress bars to show you the encryption

451
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,720
decryption operations of

452
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,400
the nut file

453
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,640
in our first technical example

454
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,400
rachel and sally will be exchanging a

455
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,839
data file

456
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,480
here we will show you the basics of

457
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,359
enough file and what it means to notify

458
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,359
how we encrypt data into its portable

459
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,039
and secure container

460
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,799
this is the heart of our data centric

461
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,080
design the ability to securely send the

462
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,320
data file in its current form carrying

463
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,160
with it all of its keys and protections

464
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,320
and securely sharing updates back and

465
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,280
forth between each person

466
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,080
so our story is going to begin with

467
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,280
rachel the real estate agent

468
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,160
representing and selling sally's home

469
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,960
now

470
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,640
before we dive into

471
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,720
the transaction portion of the of the

472
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,320
real estate process we're going to talk

473
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,000
about what a nut is so at this point

474
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,039
we've

475
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
kind of explained in this presentation

476
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,720
that we have this container called the

477
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,360
nut that it's portable and that we use

478
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,080
cryptography to

479
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,520
manage the

480
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,640
keys and the accesses behind it so what

481
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,480
i want to do here

482
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,840
is create something very simple

483
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,960
and what we're going to do is create a

484
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
file called some data it's just a simple

485
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,400
text file

486
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,039
and within this text file i'm just going

487
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,480
to put some type of

488
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,160
data in here

489
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,559
so just save

490
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,799
and here now is we have what you would

491
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,520
traditionally see is a file that exists

492
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,559
on your

493
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,799
windows explorer or file explorer

494
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,120
depending on the system that you use

495
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,160
now in the world of nuts

496
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,200
once you import this

497
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
this file into the system it becomes

498
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,039
what we call notified

499
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,280
and to show you how easy this is

500
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,760
i'm going to pick within my

501
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,280
personal management space i'm going to

502
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,360
go to sally

503
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,080
and i'm going to click on her here and

504
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,320
our options now is you can either

505
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,880
simply drag and drop this file into the

506
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,400
workspace

507
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,600
or you can right click select copy

508
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,679
and here now select an open area the

509
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,440
white space in the within the workspace

510
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,240
area

511
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,840
and you'll have an option to paste and

512
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,480
just go ahead and paste that and now

513
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,760
we're going to start the process of

514
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,360
importing the file

515
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,360
applying the encryption on it

516
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,720
and you'll see that end users

517
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,840
are able to encrypt their files

518
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,600
have them keyed and not have to worry

519
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,120
about any of

520
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,039
the technicalities around it and that

521
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,360
was it it's been imported into

522
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,160
the nuts ecosystem

523
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,799
now again this is enough file and to

524
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,880
look at what it looks like

525
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,320
you'll see that we have our original

526
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,160
document some data

527
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,440
and now we have something called some

528
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
data.txt but this is actually a dotnet

529
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,840
extension you could tell with the nut

530
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,200
icon here

531
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,320
this now

532
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
is going to live and this could be a

533
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,760
breathing document in the world of the

534
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
nuts eco group

535
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,679
one thing we could do real quick as well

536
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,000
is open this dot nut file and see what

537
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,600
it looks like

538
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,039
and here you can see

539
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,280
where we have its id

540
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,200
and again we stamp every

541
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,919
not file with a unique id

542
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,240
and that is an encrypted

543
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,640
document

544
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,840
opening it up back into the original one

545
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,480
this is what originally looked like

546
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,039
now when we say that it's portable

547
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,400
and secure

548
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,720
i could take this document

549
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,480
right click it

550
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,280
select share with

551
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,720
i'm going to share this with sally

552
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,640
and hit apply it's going to go through

553
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,159
the process of

554
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,039
applying the encryption that it needs to

555
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,200
encrypt it with the appropriate group

556
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,400
and it's going to share it with that

557
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,960
group and then send it off over to sally

558
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,880
and we'll look at sally's uh virtual

559
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
machine machine in a second

560
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,600
so here you go once a

561
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,679
document is shared within our nuts

562
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,000
ecosystem it goes from blue to red so

563
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,080
red means that you have a document

564
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,280
that's being shared with the outside

565
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,039
world whereas blue means it just resides

566
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,360
within your space

567
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,640
now let's jump over here to sally

568
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,520
this is sally

569
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,919
there you go here's the original sum

570
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,520
data

571
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
and i'm just going to add

572
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,720
more data to this file

573
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,520
save

574
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,840
and i'm going to close this up

575
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,320
so at this point

576
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,200
we've spoken about the ability to import

577
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,360
and encrypt the file automatically we're

578
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,520
able to perform a secure file transfer

579
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,760
from rachel to sally

580
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,640
by our group relationship here

581
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,799
sally and i was able to add some content

582
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,720
to this encrypted document

583
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,720
and what we're going to do here is we're

584
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,840
going to go back to rachel's machine

585
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,200
and we're going to talk a lot a little

586
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,240
bit about

587
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,200
secure

588
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,280
file and sync sharing as well

589
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,679
so secure file transfers ability to

590
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,600
securely transfer files from point a to

591
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,480
b

592
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
secure file in sync is what we call is

593
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,000
our version of collaboration where

594
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,679
you're able to not only securely

595
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,840
transfer the file from point a to b

596
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,400
but then points b c and so on and so

597
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,480
forth can actually make modifications to

598
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,799
that file and that file is propagated

599
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,320
and brought back around

600
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
to all the other members of the groups

601
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,960
that change that sally would have made

602
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,120
would have had two instances of some

603
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,320
data would have been the original

604
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,120
document then some data underscore

605
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,200
sally's versions or version two or

606
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,480
whatever

607
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,000
again but we'll get to that a little bit

608
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,320
later

609
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,280
where are the nut files

610
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,200
in this example we want to point out

611
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,000
that the sum data text file shown in red

612
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,840
resides only in these two eager groups

613
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,679
and nowhere else

614
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,600
this is a distributed system and does

615
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,760
not use a central server or store data

616
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,360
in the cloud

617
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,520
its portable data centric design does

618
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,360
not require traditional third party

619
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,240
services or dependent systems

620
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
as you can see here the file only

621
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,159
resides in two eco groups

622
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,440
rachel's and sally's

623
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,760
in our last seminar we showed you what a

624
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,440
nut looks like in diagrammatic form

625
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,320
and on the top left you see a very

626
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,280
simple nut configuration which is linear

627
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,559
in nature

628
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,559
and generally a nut is a directed

629
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,880
acyclic graph structure

630
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,360
composed of lock nodes

631
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,720
uh as the nodes or itself and the edges

632
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,120
or the connectors are cryptographic

633
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,400
links

634
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,360
now

635
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,000
there's many reasons for this type of

636
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,720
structure but one reason is shown on the

637
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,440
right side where we show you three

638
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,799
different

639
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,600
nut configurations of different types of

640
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,880
lock graphs

641
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,919
using

642
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,120
lock nodes

643
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,360
and by using these lock nodes in various

644
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,320
ways we could express different security

645
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,960
requirements of whatever payload or

646
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,279
payloads the nut is supposed to carry um

647
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,520
so in the end the nut is a container

648
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,880
that has a complex data structure

649
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,600
and within it it has sub data structures

650
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,039
called lock nodes

651
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,600
and next we'll show you exactly what

652
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,080
those knock lock nodes look like

653
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,200
at a

654
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,080
schematic level

655
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,600
each nut is a lock graph and a lock

656
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,400
graph is composed of

657
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,200
connected lock nodes and each lock node

658
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,720
looks like this

659
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,120
it has five major components in this

660
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,120
particular data structure

661
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,159
and

662
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,640
everything is

663
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,440
functioning towards protecting the bag

664
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,120
or the payload where you're going to put

665
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,720
your data in

666
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
now we have a universal keyhole for

667
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,880
every lock node we have something called

668
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,360
a variable lock there's three types of

669
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,679
locks in there which is the or lock the

670
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,320
secret sharing lock and the max lock or

671
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,559
otherwise known as the and lock

672
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,919
and

673
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,520
you have something called the stratum

674
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,120
access control and the nut access

675
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,320
control and all of these four

676
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,640
protective layers work together to

677
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,320
protect the bag or the payload

678
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,520
so what does

679
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,799
somedata.txt.net look like from our

680
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,640
previous demonstration this is a 7 lock

681
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,640
node lock graph which represents this

682
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,320
particular duct file

683
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,799
and it has this configuration where it's

684
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,039
connected in a different way it's it's

685
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,720
non-linear

686
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,120
it actually has five payloads at the

687
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,840
right hand side and you could tell that

688
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,240
in the front where level zero is we have

689
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,640
a nut lock so that's a lock note acting

690
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,080
as a gateway

691
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,840
and that is where all the key holes are

692
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,279
defined and

693
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,440
the proper combination of keys will give

694
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,000
you certain types of accesses into the

695
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,760
various payloads

696
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,840
now

697
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,320
the payloads themselves there's five of

698
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,200
them

699
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,919
the data that we were showing you is

700
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,000
actually going into the third payload

701
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,760
called the payload

702
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,840
block node and

703
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,919
these are protected in various different

704
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,760
ways and we'll go through that in the

705
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,080
next slide

706
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,480
you might be asking what about that

707
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,000
structured data folding with

708
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,039
transmutation stuff that you mentioned

709
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,600
we went over that last year as well as i

710
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,880
mentioned in the beginning of this

711
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,159
presentation

712
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,279
well

713
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,440
if you take a look at any of the lock

714
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,960
nodes

715
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,799
as a data structure

716
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,919
this is where we start using sdft to

717
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,919
enable what we call structured

718
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,520
cryptography

719
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,200
and

720
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,840
since each lock node has various

721
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,320
segments that can lock and unlock data

722
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
what we mean by that is it will

723
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,480
cryptographically cipher it or decipher

724
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,640
it

725
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,600
we need a more systematic

726
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,960
compact portable and embeddable method

727
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,279
of doing that and what you're seeing at

728
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,440
the top right

729
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,640
rectangle

730
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,039
is an example of a tar

731
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,120
instruction so it's a transmutation

732
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,360
audit record is what atar is

733
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,720
and in this one it's called b1 nonac

734
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,559
encrypt and dyn so

735
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,520
you know when we read down that

736
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,919
transmutation audit record press

737
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,559
serialize and code compress

738
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,159
s cipher digest and encode you could

739
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,480
almost read the recipe

740
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,919
of how

741
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,960
that particular payload within this

742
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,279
carnac lock node was actually processed

743
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,520
excluding the key obviously

744
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,039
and

745
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,880
and and you should be fairly familiar

746
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,600
with all of these types of operations

747
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,399
now

748
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,600
normally

749
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,840
uh data transformation

750
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,120
functions and

751
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,760
cryptographic functions are

752
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,159
generally not normalized together

753
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,440
here transmutations actually normalizes

754
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,360
them so that they could be used

755
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,919
interchangeably as long as you you do

756
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,760
operations in a sequence that actually

757
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,480
makes sense

758
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,799
so what happens here is that

759
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,799
we could now process

760
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,640
this payload

761
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,039
in this method of pressing it of

762
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,200
serializing it of encoding it

763
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,799
compressing it

764
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,559
symmetric ciphering it and then

765
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,559
creating a digest and then

766
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,279
base64 encoding it we do that that's

767
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,840
called the forward mode

768
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,799
now when we go when we're receiver or

769
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,600
we're trying to unlock this lock node we

770
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,039
do the reverse

771
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,960
and that's where the special properties

772
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,120
of transmutations come in is that we've

773
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,440
actually mapped the reversible

774
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,840
characteristics of any

775
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,919
data transformation or transmutation

776
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,399
operation that is reversible obviously

777
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,559
not all transmutations are reversible

778
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,720
but most of them are

779
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,679
and when they are we can do it so the

780
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,240
programmer ends up really just worrying

781
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,440
about

782
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,000
half the instructions because if you do

783
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,960
it right

784
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,799
the other half which is the reverse

785
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,399
process is guaranteed right now

786
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,799
here's another one so within the same

787
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,200
nut we actually have a different tar

788
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,480
operating

789
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,360
on a different payload and

790
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,120
similar type of lock node but in this

791
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,960
case we have something called the nut

792
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,640
access control working

793
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,559
and so that requires a different type of

794
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,840
locking

795
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,559
and here the difference is really

796
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,279
the size of the aes key

797
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,080
and that we're using actually a 10 24

798
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,039
bit rsa key to digitally sign

799
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,600
this particular message and that gives

800
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,919
it different properties of control

801
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:16,799
so

802
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,279
this is actually sdft in action and you

803
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,279
can see the lock node is actually

804
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,640
composed

805
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,520
of

806
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,320
secure messages and pieces of it can be

807
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,840
unlocked locked at will

808
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,799
in our next demo we'll cover with the

809
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,399
use of well-known cryptographic

810
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,760
techniques

811
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,399
how we can create history for a file

812
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,240
and manage its versions

813
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,919
digitally sign it

814
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,640
make it resilient and even pass urls

815
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,080
privately

816
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,720
we'll use the actors bob rachel and fred

817
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,640
working to sign a real estate document

818
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,240
start off is

819
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,159
we have a loan document and rachel needs

820
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,679
to see this loan document it's already

821
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,600
been shared amongst the group but we're

822
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,039
gonna we're gonna

823
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,799
represent this by having a three-way

824
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,799
chat

825
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,000
and rachel's going to ask them to please

826
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,760
send some documents

827
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,120
and of course she's going to want them

828
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,600
to sign them as well so bob and fred are

829
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,360
going to ratify these documents by

830
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,200
signing them and we're going to do that

831
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,640
in two ways

832
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,320
the first ways the first way we're going

833
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,480
to do this is

834
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,080
fred here is going to take his loan

835
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,760
document

836
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,159
he's going to open it up

837
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,600
and he's going to say

838
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,519
fred's

839
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,840
signature

840
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,170
he's going to save this file

841
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,919
[Music]

842
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,600
and we're going to let

843
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,760
replication occur now what we're going

844
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,919
to go through right now is history and

845
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,880
payload versions so we have the ability

846
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,240
to package multiple versions of changes

847
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,399
uh kind of tying back to the uh

848
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,000
synchronizing uh and sharing of files

849
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,360
and we're gonna demonstrate that here

850
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,519
right now so we're gonna go over to bob

851
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,519
here

852
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,760
here we have three-way chat bob has

853
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,279
received this message police on the

854
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,919
docks so obviously he has to

855
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,760
go about and make sure that he is

856
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,000
signing his docs as well so here now bob

857
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,440
is also going to

858
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,480
double click

859
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,200
on this file

860
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,799
now double click occurred because those

861
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,080
replications coming through

862
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,519
let me save this as well

863
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,519
so this is updating at this point as

864
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,360
well so here we are

865
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,799
we have

866
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,200
fred that signed the document paper has

867
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,880
also signed this loan document as well

868
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,240
sorry absolutely completed

869
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,840
the latest payload has been placed in

870
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,080
there

871
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,120
go to rachel

872
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,519
let's see where status is with this

873
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,960
replicating around she is version nine

874
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,919
double click on it

875
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,279
and here we are we have bob's signature

876
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,120
and fred's signature in here

877
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,440
now the cool thing going to history and

878
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,919
version control as you can go back

879
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,840
say open

880
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,000
and i could say history and show

881
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,519
a previous version of this

882
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,440
open specific previous version is what i

883
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,120
wanted to show not open previous version

884
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,480
that opens up the previous version so

885
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,320
here you can see all the changes have

886
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,720
been made fred signed it bob signed it

887
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,440
so here i could select this

888
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,200
version here open it up and say let me

889
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,640
look at it what it was before bob

890
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,640
touched it and at that point it was fred

891
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,840
that had signed it but bob had not

892
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,840
signed the document yet

893
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,080
and you could go and traverse back

894
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,840
through the history and the versions of

895
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840
this payload

896
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,760
and see all the various

897
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,760
versions of this file here and

898
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,000
everything that's happened to it

899
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,880
now

900
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,519
that covers

901
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,679
payload history and being able to look

902
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,039
at different versions

903
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,600
and there's another way you can also

904
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,120
sign this document and that's actually

905
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,519
applying a digital signature now we can

906
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,520
go back here and have fred

907
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,918
say you know what everything looks great

908
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,079
on my end what i want to do is just

909
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,879
highlight this document here

910
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,800
i'm going to digitally sign it by

911
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,839
clicking on digital signatures

912
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,000
over here he could find his signature

913
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,800
enter his

914
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,480
obviously his password that he needs to

915
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,239
access in order to

916
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,800
sign it with a certificate and this now

917
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
is going to go through the process of

918
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,679
actually signing this file itself and

919
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,000
securing it and

920
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,359
and sending it off

921
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,359
to the other two people in the

922
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,520
group relationship

923
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,159
select bob here next

924
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,839
bob needs to perform the same action

925
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,000
there it is a loan document

926
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,200
came through

927
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,680
you see now that there's a signature

928
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,079
it's highlighted i could click on this

929
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,599
and i could see that

930
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,520
again this is a bob's signature here

931
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,040
that he signed digitally signed it

932
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,520
and bob's gonna do the same thing he's

933
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,560
gonna sign this as well

934
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,118
enter his password

935
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,480
and it's going to go through the process

936
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,920
of signing the nut

937
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,280
performing the encryption operations

938
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,599
again and sending it off to the group

939
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,119
so now

940
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,280
bob has signed this document digitally

941
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,800
signed the document as well

942
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,640
fred has done the same thing

943
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,720
and while we're working through this

944
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,000
we're going to come back to rachel the

945
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,800
real estate agent

946
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,040
and we're going to talk about this test

947
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,560
file so we're also going to talk about

948
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,400
data resiliency while this process is

949
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,240
going through and the documents being

950
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,400
passed around

951
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,800
one feature about nuts is its ability to

952
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,560
have data resilience and what that means

953
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,040
is that if you illegally tamper with

954
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,680
your nut files we have the ability to

955
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,920
bring them back to life and also be able

956
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,920
to preserve

957
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,680
the data that is in there so in this

958
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,040
example here

959
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,119
i'm going to delete

960
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,520
this file illegally

961
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,480
from rachel's desktop now this is a file

962
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,119
test file that was shared with

963
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,480
fred and bob

964
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,359
so

965
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,119
we're going to delete this

966
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,800
and this process takes a little bit

967
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,320
longer so

968
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,680
while this action has occurred where i

969
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,960
legally deleted it we're going to come

970
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,400
back and look at

971
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,040
check on our loan document this point so

972
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,680
now it's in version 11.

973
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,119
so we want to go and check the

974
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,119
signatures here

975
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,200
and here you go now rachel

976
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,280
can confirm that there's been two

977
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,640
digital signatures applied to this

978
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,800
document one is bob's

979
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,280
and one is fred's

980
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,960
so that has been validated so now we

981
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,160
just showed you that we're able to

982
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,800
digitally sign the document as well as

983
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,400
do signatures that are embedded within

984
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,640
the file inch and we could see either

985
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,400
the signatures or any changes to the

986
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,640
payload file through going through this

987
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,118
history

988
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,720
coming back to our next

989
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,960
little demo it was

990
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,200
the illegal deletion of a test file now

991
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,880
this process takes a little bit longer

992
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,400
because what we do is we have a method

993
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,560
in which we catalog every single nut

994
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,440
file on your system and what the system

995
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,280
does is every so often it walks through

996
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,720
all your nut files

997
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,480
and verifies as hashes and make sure

998
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,400
that the integrated files are correct

999
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,240
and they're there now in this example

1000
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,720
here because i illegally deleted it

1001
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,920
what's going to happen is it's going to

1002
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,599
walk through its catalog

1003
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,599
it's going to see that the actual file

1004
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,240
the nut file is missing and because it's

1005
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,200
missing it's going to say hey i need to

1006
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,119
pull back the copy because the

1007
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,720
file is supposed to exist in this folder

1008
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,079
structure here

1009
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,280
so what it's going to do it's going to

1010
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,280
go off to

1011
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,400
fraud and bob's

1012
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,880
ecosystems and say hey i've shared a

1013
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,160
file with you

1014
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,400
i need to copy that file can you please

1015
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,079
someone back over to me

1016
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,760
so that is what's currently happening

1017
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,680
under the hood here so while that

1018
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,800
process is in flight there's one more

1019
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,119
item that we could uh go over and talk

1020
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,040
quickly about

1021
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,359
once

1022
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,440
bob has signed and completed his loan

1023
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,680
documents

1024
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,520
he has now purchased the house and of

1025
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,440
course like any other loan

1026
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,119
you're gonna have to start setting up a

1027
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,960
portal to log into your bank site to

1028
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,960
make sure that you start making your

1029
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,320
monthly payments

1030
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,240
now the one thing fred's gonna do here

1031
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,960
is he has a bookmark

1032
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,599
and he set up this bookmark where

1033
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,200
it's a private

1034
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,480
url

1035
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,160
to their website

1036
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,240
for bob to be able to access this portal

1037
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,599
privately

1038
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,000
so he's going to share this

1039
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,240
with bob

1040
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
hit apply here and we're going to let

1041
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,400
this

1042
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,720
url

1043
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,680
uh

1044
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,440
go through the process of being shared

1045
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,079
with just bob himself

1046
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,839
so while that is in flight we're going

1047
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,760
to go back and check on rachel real

1048
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,359
quick and here you are

1049
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,520
the test file has come back so

1050
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,920
i illegally deleted this file the system

1051
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,680
said hey there's something happened to

1052
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,800
this data

1053
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,640
supposed to be there he didn't tell me

1054
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,480
about it he went and fetched and brought

1055
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,640
it back so this is part of what we call

1056
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,480
data resiliency and again the ability to

1057
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,720
keep your data in place think of stuff

1058
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,599
like um like ransomware or an insider

1059
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,800
threat that may

1060
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,440
uh be someone that decided to delete a

1061
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,520
bunch of files off your machine or

1062
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,040
ransomware they may have encrypted that

1063
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,880
file you just delete it and the system

1064
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,520
auto recovers it for you

1065
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,640
now to go back to

1066
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,839
bob here

1067
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,000
so here we go now to bob's

1068
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,160
world his eagle group clicks on his

1069
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,760
relationship with the bank he sees that

1070
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,599
fred shared a private access link with

1071
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,040
them so

1072
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,720
fred prefers this link to be opened up

1073
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,599
with

1074
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,040
internet explorer and what you're going

1075
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,640
to do is go double click on this and

1076
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,920
it's going to take them to this private

1077
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,200
site

1078
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,960
so this is now a private bank site this

1079
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,440
is a privately shared url that fred said

1080
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,760
that bob

1081
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,240
this is a complete random url at the top

1082
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,160
here just to highlight that

1083
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,480
so in the world of internet you can make

1084
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,480
this completely private

1085
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,319
no one has to see it

1086
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,000
you don't have to have him go to first

1087
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,680
federal.com to set up a login site he

1088
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,040
could be sent a very private url

1089
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,880
and here i'm going to just go to and say

1090
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,280
hey i'm bob i'm logging in and here you

1091
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,400
go he's accessing his account online

1092
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,680
directly with the first bank

1093
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,079
and that completes demo number three

1094
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,119
where are the nuts

1095
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,119
as mentioned in the previous demo all

1096
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,760
the files chats and urls reside locally

1097
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,079
in each actor's eco groups

1098
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,400
to recap this demonstration

1099
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,800
with history we can retain all versions

1100
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,800
of the files chats and urls for

1101
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,720
providence and audit trails to the use

1102
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,200
of our cryptographic techniques

1103
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
with digital signatures we can place

1104
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,040
these into the payloads of enough file

1105
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,119
in a particular version as a signature

1106
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,880
by one of the actors

1107
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,359
think of it like a confirmation

1108
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,960
the use of digital signatures in this

1109
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,880
example is different

1110
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,720
as the traditional use of signatures is

1111
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,280
used to detect tampering and forgery

1112
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,720
which we already covered through our

1113
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,359
data resiliency example

1114
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,040
as you know data resiliency is a hot

1115
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,119
topic in cyber security

1116
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,680
our secure data center container

1117
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,760
carries with it its history and access

1118
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,960
control so it can protect itself

1119
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,000
lastly

1120
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,839
private portable data structures that

1121
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,960
are identifiable like are knots

1122
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
can be used in the private url sharing

1123
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,319
example

1124
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,000
here with this technique

1125
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,839
we could show that instead of having a

1126
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,160
dedicated public home page that people

1127
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,640
need to go to we were privately sharing

1128
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,160
this url with a certain person

1129
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,839
public home pages as you know that are

1130
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,079
dedicated are subject to ddos attacks

1131
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,000
and hacking attempts

1132
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,920
we can even throw around and entertain

1133
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,800
the idea and concepts of url rotations

1134
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,599
kind of like key rotations

1135
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,240
when we demonstrate this ecosystem to

1136
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,240
various audiences

1137
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,040
we

1138
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,440
we get a common question and the

1139
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,880
question is

1140
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,280
is the nut router necessary

1141
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,880
um some people have suggested that

1142
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,119
there's stuff that we're keeping in the

1143
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,440
nut router that makes the system work

1144
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,200
that there's a centralized database

1145
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,560
somewhere that we're holding all the

1146
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,800
nuts there

1147
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,000
that we may actually be holding keys and

1148
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,920
in order to prove

1149
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,960
that the nut router is not necessary

1150
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,480
we started a little project called

1151
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,920
remora

1152
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,880
and

1153
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,920
in this case what we do is we actually

1154
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,000
show you that the nut router is

1155
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,240
completely unnecessary

1156
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,880
and that all the information that's

1157
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,599
required to make the system work and

1158
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,680
throughout the ecosystem

1159
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,160
is the source nuts themselves and that's

1160
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,880
it

1161
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,720
and so

1162
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,280
fun things happen when source nuts

1163
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,599
collide source nuts that have identical

1164
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,280
ids collide

1165
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,560
and it's how we deal with that collision

1166
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,599
that makes all of this stuff um

1167
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,240
you know fascinating and and it actually

1168
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,760
allows it to work

1169
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,640
so

1170
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,599
here

1171
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,119
what we're we're saying a couple of

1172
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,440
things here by this example we're saying

1173
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,280
that

1174
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,880
the nut system is transport agnostic

1175
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,880
it is completely independent of any

1176
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,920
centralized services including an outer

1177
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,680
and any mode of transporting nuts

1178
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,400
will

1179
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,000
give it its full functionality

1180
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,000
our project memorial demo takes us to

1181
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,160
rachel and fred collaborating over a

1182
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,640
sensitive document

1183
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,480
here

1184
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,480
i've selected the fred from first bank

1185
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,800
relationship that rachel has and they're

1186
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,200
collaborating with over a time sensitive

1187
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,480
document

1188
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,760
and

1189
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,960
there's a

1190
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,040
denial service attack that has suddenly

1191
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,640
started to occur

1192
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,280
on the cloud provider that hosts their

1193
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,680
nut router or rendezvous server as we

1194
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,800
also

1195
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,000
may call it

1196
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,599
and from what we've mentioned in

1197
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,960
previous demos

1198
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,839
there's this router that helps

1199
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,839
you package and send

1200
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,079
the nut file from one equal group to

1201
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,839
another and in this demonstration here

1202
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,359
we're going to show you how we're not

1203
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,119
dependent on that

1204
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,119
service at all and that we could pick

1205
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,680
any type of medium to transport our nut

1206
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,520
file over from one eagle group to the

1207
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,400
next

1208
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,079
and in this demo here we're going to use

1209
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,240
uh gmail so what i'm going to do first

1210
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,599
is

1211
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,720
replicate

1212
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,079
the outage

1213
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,800
of your cloud provider by

1214
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,440
turning off the rendezvous server

1215
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,240
now this is a cloud hosted rendezvous

1216
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,880
server uh just to mention you could also

1217
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,480
have your own hosted rendezvous server

1218
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,160
as well so desired and you can see on

1219
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,400
the upper right hand corner here that

1220
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,480
it's turned from green or red

1221
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,040
so now we have

1222
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,960
rachel only using gmail as an option to

1223
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,000
communicate this time-sensitive document

1224
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,960
now what i'm going to do here is i'm

1225
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,720
going to double click on it

1226
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,000
and we're going to continue

1227
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,520
collaborating

1228
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,480
by adding more data

1229
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,400
and

1230
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,240
the eco the notebook is still going to

1231
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,720
go through its process of encrypting the

1232
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,280
file with its updated payload packaging

1233
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,720
it and wanting to send it off over to

1234
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,760
fred

1235
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,119
and it's done that and it's going to

1236
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,359
find its medium to send it over to in

1237
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,400
this case

1238
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,079
like we mentioned earlier running the

1239
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,839
servers down because of the cloud outage

1240
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,680
and we're going to use gmail instead i'm

1241
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,680
going to come over to fred now here's

1242
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,680
fred i'm going to

1243
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,760
take a look at his gmail and here we go

1244
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,160
here's a file that's coming from rachel

1245
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,920
i'm going to click on it

1246
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,160
and it's a nut file

1247
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:26,839
it's

1248
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:28,400
encrypted

1249
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,839
this file contains all of the access and

1250
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,440
key management systems that we've

1251
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,040
discussed in other demonstrations as

1252
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,640
well as the payload

1253
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,640
file version histories and all the

1254
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,079
metadata

1255
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,000
i'm going to minimize this here i'm

1256
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,359
going to open up

1257
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,598
his

1258
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,079
notebook and you could see here that

1259
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,000
i've already turned off

1260
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,440
the rendezvous server because there's an

1261
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,200
outage and i'm going to double click on

1262
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,720
this file

1263
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,720
and here's add more data

1264
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,480
and we're able to use alternative

1265
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,400
methods such as gmail

1266
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,720
or any other cloud provided service or

1267
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,319
any other email service or any other

1268
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,200
mechanism so to speak of being able to

1269
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,240
pass data back and forth

1270
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,319
the last feature we'd like to leave you

1271
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,760
with today

1272
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,440
is

1273
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,440
we asked a very simple question

1274
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,280
who said history has to stop at the

1275
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,480
present

1276
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,760
and we call this project carnac

1277
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,839
remember karnak is carnac the

1278
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,160
magnificent and it was a johnny carson

1279
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,280
character

1280
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,839
that sometimes could tell the future

1281
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,160
anyway

1282
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,160
we saw the example where you could

1283
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,880
actually delve into a nuts history and

1284
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,440
you can see the revision um

1285
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,079
versions in the ba in the past

1286
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,359
and then you could resurrect it if you

1287
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,920
wanted to and change it over

1288
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,960
well

1289
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,280
question begs to be answered is who said

1290
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,960
history has to stop at the present that

1291
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,160
is

1292
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,160
that is the conventional thinking is

1293
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,359
that history stops at the present

1294
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,800
we took it further and once you once you

1295
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,640
change that perception

1296
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,960
it becomes

1297
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,400
where the future

1298
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,720
is really a calendar and if you take it

1299
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,559
into the computer world

1300
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,000
that is called

1301
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,559
you could put in a scheduled event

1302
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,720
so we actually see

1303
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,960
the previous history of revision

1304
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,440
histories as a continuation of a

1305
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,520
timeline where you're just standing in

1306
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,640
the present

1307
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,640
and everything behind you there are

1308
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,040
virgin histories and that's passed and

1309
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,720
everything ahead of you

1310
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,160
is possible future events

1311
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,119
therefore we gave every nut a past and a

1312
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,319
future

1313
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,040
this is nuts

1314
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,520
in the carnac demo we have a file named

1315
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,760
text records.txt

1316
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,760
as you can see right here

1317
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,440
and we're going to do a

1318
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,559
couple of things here we're going to go

1319
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,160
to metadata

1320
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,800
and we'll select view event calendar and

1321
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,319
with this file today what we do is we

1322
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,640
select the option of deleting it

1323
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,720
and this is our seven year retention

1324
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,720
policy

1325
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,400
so this thing is set at the corporate

1326
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,359
level and this is something that

1327
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,040
compliance

1328
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,200
requires

1329
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,359
to delete

1330
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,400
and everyone's pretty much familiar with

1331
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,280
what that means uh so here we could date

1332
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,280
this uh sometime in the future in this

1333
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,280
example i'm just gonna date a few

1334
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,400
minutes ahead but it could also be dated

1335
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,280
to

1336
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,200
be performed

1337
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,359
seven years into the future

1338
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,680
now we're gonna select this to apply and

1339
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,079
let this apply and take hold

1340
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,680
and again we're applying this metadata

1341
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,000
to the nut file itself

1342
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,440
and uh

1343
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,920
to remind everyone a nut

1344
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,880
file is because it's portable

1345
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,800
that entry carries with that nut file

1346
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,160
wherever it goes so this isn't a setting

1347
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,839
that

1348
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,800
is set to activate on the system itself

1349
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,880
that requires this particular notebook

1350
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,559
application or this particular nut

1351
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,079
server

1352
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,720
this event is placed in the nut file

1353
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,960
because of its portability to go

1354
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,720
anywhere that it needs to go and carry

1355
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,960
it with it in this example here i've

1356
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,800
shared it with ewan in the group

1357
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,359
relationship and he has a copy of this

1358
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,839
tax record with the exact same retention

1359
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:23,119
policy as well and

1360
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,280
now here we're going at the

1361
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,040
the time is up it's going through the

1362
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,440
process of deactivating this next

1363
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,800
tax record

1364
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,960
out of the system

1365
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,280
this nut file should no longer exist

1366
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,119
within the eco group

1367
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,839
and it's deleted it and that is karnak

1368
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,160
the data centric ecosystem that was

1369
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,240
demonstrated today

1370
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,960
can unify your data

1371
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,400
in a way that

1372
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,920
very few if no systems that that we know

1373
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,760
of can do this

1374
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,520
and it goes across

1375
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,240
almost any network any operating system

1376
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,040
that could support nut software

1377
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,200
um and any hardware

1378
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,280
and therefore

1379
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,160
your data is everything and everything

1380
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,520
else gets commoditized

1381
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,760
it's a very very unique

1382
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,599
type of technology

1383
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,920
that we believe shows a different

1384
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,040
approach

1385
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,359
to how we think about data

1386
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:26,640
and that

1387
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,480
once we start thinking about data a

1388
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,800
little bit differently like this

1389
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,839
it starts doing a lot of things

1390
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,200
on its own

1391
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,880
with permission

1392
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,720
it is data that is intrinsically

1393
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,040
protected both at rest and in transit in

1394
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,119
a consistent fashion

1395
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,160
and that security is actually portable

1396
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,119
and under the direct control

1397
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,119
of each user

1398
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,520
where they hold the keys

1399
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,599
where do you store the keys you store it

1400
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,240
inside a nut where it's secure

1401
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,200
so

1402
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,119
the nut itself kind of gives you that

1403
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,359
recursive nature almost like a fractal

1404
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:06,559
behavior

1405
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:07,520
and

1406
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,079
it's a very elegant scheme

1407
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,359
and you could see that benefits are many

1408
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:18,759
and the promises are very cool

1409
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,880
here's the familiar reference models

1410
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,680
from the osi and the tcp conceptual

1411
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,480
layers the osi has seven respective

1412
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,319
layers and the tcp has four of them with

1413
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,359
their equivalences

1414
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,760
what we started realizing when we're

1415
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,760
working on nuts

1416
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,359
is that

1417
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:48,000
it not starts acting as a type of data

1418
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,200
operating system that sits on on a

1419
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,760
higher layer so it is a series of

1420
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,839
applications

1421
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,240
obviously it uses transport and network

1422
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,280
layers

1423
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,000
but it is where the data is king and

1424
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,720
it's the data that's protected from end

1425
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,079
to end so

1426
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,880
it is a little bit more than end-to-end

1427
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,119
encryption it is beyond end-to-end

1428
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,920
encryption and um

1429
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,079
we started thinking of this as how does

1430
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,359
it fit

1431
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,760
in these models and

1432
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,640
maybe you know we thought hey you know

1433
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,559
maybe this time to quest a question

1434
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:29,200
whether this model needs to be extended

1435
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,400
for

1436
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,000
a

1437
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,920
ecosystem like the one you just saw

1438
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,960
today

1439
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,839
so this is a this is a good thing to

1440
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,280
debate on and

1441
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,760
and discuss but

1442
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,800
i'd like to leave you with this and

1443
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,680
you know we're open to any questions and

1444
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,280
thank you for

1445
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,240
coming to the seminar today

1446
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,800
great great great job great presentation

1447
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,680
um attendees if you have questions you

1448
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,960
can go ahead and use the q a button

1449
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,720
it should be located

1450
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,240
in your zoom

1451
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,640
window

1452
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,119
or raise your hand and i can turn on

1453
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,200
your microphone

1454
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,920
okay looks like we have one question uh

1455
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,359
from eric it says uh how does the nut

1456
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,880
router make routing decisions

1457
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,319
so

1458
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:47,440
that's a very good question um

1459
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,599
the nut router obviously has to keep

1460
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,960
track of

1461
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,200
ip addresses while while there's

1462
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,960
connectivity because

1463
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,000
we have to work through the nat walls um

1464
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,640
which still exists for ipv4

1465
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,839
um

1466
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,079
we're moving to ipv6 but that's that's

1467
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,720
two decades in the making so someday

1468
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,160
we're going to all get there but not

1469
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,200
today

1470
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,799
and

1471
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,119
so the nut router does make dynamic

1472
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,799
tables for ip addresses ports

1473
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:19,119
in order to route it back

1474
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,839
but in essence the main driver of the

1475
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,200
routing is these nut ids and a nut id is

1476
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,400
a 512-bit shock to hash

1477
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,400
it's practically unique there's no

1478
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,559
guarantee of uniqueness but with a

1479
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,480
512-bit number

1480
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,880
it's um it's large enough to be

1481
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,680
considered uh practically unique and um

1482
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,880
we actually route based upon that um

1483
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,200
and whatever ips that you tend to be

1484
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,640
coming in from

1485
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,040
uh from any number of computers in your

1486
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,200
eagle group it'll just map it to that

1487
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,799
but really you're just working with that

1488
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,799
ids

1489
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,160
okay we have another one um

1490
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,160
for remora

1491
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,079
how does the software know what email

1492
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,200
address to forward the nut to

1493
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,000
so

1494
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,359
um

1495
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,160
i think you saw that part where uh some

1496
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,839
tiers showed that there's a rendezvous

1497
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,559
server switch and a gmail switch

1498
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,240
so for the demo

1499
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,319
we put in a gmail thing and then part of

1500
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,400
the configuration for that user in that

1501
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,359
duct browser is to put in your

1502
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,480
your

1503
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,079
gmail address

1504
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,359
and also i think it may require you know

1505
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,880
for you to get an

1506
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,559
api key from gmail as well but also

1507
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:59,280
you'd be asked for the um login

1508
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,400
credentials at that point so that your

1509
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,079
nut server running locally in the

1510
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:06,880
background can connect to um

1511
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,000
your gmail api and and submit that email

1512
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,400
on your behalf

1513
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,200
there any more questions

1514
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,319
does not look like there are any more

1515
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,000
coming in but yoon

1516
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,040
so so tiara and uh bob i you know i'd

1517
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,280
just like to thank you guys for

1518
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,520
uh presenting today i really appreciate

1519
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,160
it uh i think what you're doing here is

1520
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,720
uh pretty powerful and pretty uh pretty

1521
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,119
amazing you know and

1522
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,520
a very important need i you know that i

1523
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,960
can see that a lot of

1524
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,079
businesses are looking into and you know

1525
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,200
are definitely going to need in the

1526
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,559
future

1527
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,720
i think one thing that i could leave you

1528
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,359
with as an overall comment like is that

1529
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:18,480
um

1530
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,200
what we're trying to do in one way

1531
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,119
is that

1532
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,720
you know companies and systems out there

1533
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,520
want you to use their resources their

1534
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,880
services and in some way monetize that

1535
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,680
um

1536
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,240
our feeling for one of the motivations

1537
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,000
of the technology is that

1538
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,160
you know we carry in our pockets immense

1539
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,240
amounts of uh storage that and

1540
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,799
processing power that that doesn't even

1541
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:47,359
we hardly ever use uh but for the most

1542
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:49,119
part it's the title

1543
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,079
and what nuts technologies is what was

1544
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,799
created for one of the motivations is to

1545
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:57,280
try and make use

1546
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,599
of your own resources as much as

1547
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:02,240
possible as much as you would like

1548
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,480
so think about all the laptops and

1549
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,119
desktops you have at home

1550
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:09,599
that may not be the cutting edge but is

1551
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,319
still clearly capable of storing your

1552
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:15,200
data in a redundant form so that

1553
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,680
we make more efficient use of it and not

1554
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,640
get charged twice or three times for the

1555
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,160
same space

1556
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,760
on the cloud drives

1557
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,359
um or

1558
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,319
you get three cloud drives but the the

1559
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,000
bargain that you strike there is that

1560
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
they get to rifle through all your all

1561
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,400
your data for free so

1562
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,960
this is a different way that you know i

1563
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,960
started this mainly because

1564
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,880
i felt a severe frustration with the

1565
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,359
lack of ability for you to really use

1566
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:48,240
your devices and resources to the extent

1567
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,920
possible that they're being

1568
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,799
underutilized and why do you want to pay

1569
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,319
for more and then why do you want to

1570
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:56,160
give away your data that you've

1571
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,240
carefully collected

1572
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,640
and should remain private and um so

1573
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,359
that's that's kind of the overall you

1574
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:04,559
know um

1575
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,400
you know reasoning behind this and i

1576
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,200
think

1577
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,760
most people who who we've spoken to when

1578
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,240
you when you talk about this motivations

1579
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,400
they they readily agree that

1580
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,440
um it is a problem but we've almost

1581
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,760
gotten immune to sort of

1582
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,640
realizing these are still problems

1583
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,319
so i'll leave you guys with that

1584
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,359
great great thank you so much really

1585
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,200
appreciate it um

1586
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,559
and you know we'll be looking forward to

1587
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,400
hearing more uh

1588
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,960
about this technology and from you too

1589
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,319
and you know

1590
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,720
hopefully we can have you guys uh visit

1591
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,200
us on campus too at purdue uh in the

1592
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,799
future when things start opening back up

1593
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,880
uh we'd love that and uh you know we're

1594

always open to uh
