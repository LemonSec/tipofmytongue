syria's

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,800
so cyber security has long been an area

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,199
of strength at purdue last year the u.s

13

news undergraduate program ranking puts

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,640
purdue at number six in cyber security

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,520
today

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,760
sirius is the cyber security hub at

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,320

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,600
staff and furthermore serving as the

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,800
bridge that connects purdue to industry

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,559
government and other academic

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,000
institutions

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,120
as a very timely example just yesterday

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,840
the first indiana wide cyber security

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,960

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,640
in recent years we said we at syria set

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,680
the vision called cyber security plus

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,439
where we embed security privacy and

38
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,640
trustworthiness in a wide range of

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,119
discipline and application domains

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,880
such as aerospace autonomous control

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,479
energy manufacturing

42
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,000
and supply chains

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,399
doing this fosters initiatives that

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,960
combines produce cyber strength with

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
purdue strength in other disciplines

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,680

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,280
this coming thursday

97
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,680
internally we work very closely with

98
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,760
other purdue centers institutes and

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,480
programs including but not limiting to

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,840
broad collaboration reflects the

103
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,400
importance of cyber security as a

104
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,480
cross-cutting issue in different domains

105
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,200
and sectors

106
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,319
so

107
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,879
our cyber security week actually started

108
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,600
this past weekend with the tracer fire

109
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,440
cyber forensics training camp and

110
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,880
competition

111
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,360
a big thank a big thank you to our

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
friends and colleagues at sandia

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,680
national labs in sirius who provided

114
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,240
both on-site and remote support that

115
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,720
make this event very successful due to

116
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,639
space limitation we were only able to

117
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,199
accommodate just half of the student who

118
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,800
signed up for the event

119
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,199
the tracer firecam has become a common

120
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,080
platform for establishing cyber security

121
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,639
talent pipeline from purdue and our

122
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,520
minority serving institution partners to

123
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,919
our national security and national

124
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,919

125
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,479
sandia and minor

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,240
another talent pipeline is also being

127
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,560
established by our colleagues at purdue

128
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,680
cyber tab

129
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
in collaboration with sirius they

130
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,000
recently received a 2 million grant from

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,560
the national security agency to train

132
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,479
cyber security professionals and

133
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,120
teachers for indiana local governments

134
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,960
and k-12 school districts

135
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,919
we have also been working on defense

136
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,080
workforce development in collaboration

137
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,320
with mitre last year we organized and

138
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,720
hosted the first software security

139
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,440
summer school which featured hands-on

140
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,080
exercises based on cutting-edge research

141
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,759
sponsored by the office of naval

142
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,800
research

143
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,639
more than 70 professionals from the

144
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,720
defense community participated in the

145
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,880
week-long hands-on training

146
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,960
and this week event is coming back this

147
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,680
year actually in just two weeks and it

148

158
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,560
the 4 15 p.m

159
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,440
so i guess after describing some of the

160
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,520
highlights in education and workforce

161
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,039
development i need to say something

162
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,280
about purdue cyber security research so

163
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,360
how good is purdue cyber security

164
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,160
research i only have one graph to show

165
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
according to the latest ranking of high

166
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,360
impact research publication in security

167
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,919
producing is number four in terms of

168
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,639
papers published at the most competitive

169
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,240
peer-reviewed cyber security conferences

170
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,560
so this is just a few highlights of what

171
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,039
is going on at sirius i would like to

172
