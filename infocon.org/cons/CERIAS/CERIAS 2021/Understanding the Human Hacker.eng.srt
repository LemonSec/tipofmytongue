1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,480
so hey welcome good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,319
who has been uh

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,960
uh eavesdropping on my conversation with

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,320
my good friend

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,160
uh we have had the great opportunity to

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,559
work together on a couple proposals

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,799
uh she is one of my go-to faculty when

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,800
it comes to cyber security curriculum as

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,480
well as

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,960
the uh the human computer interface and

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,520
so

12
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,439
a little bit of those topics will be

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,960
touched on today

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,519
so i guess as a more formal introduction

15
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,599
it's my pleasure to introduce

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,760
one of our faculty members from the

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,440
computer and information technology

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,200
program in the purdue polytechnic

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,960
institute at purdue university

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,200
and long time serious affiliated faculty

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,320
member ida

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,520
nombecki yeah welcome all right

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,079
thank you joel it's very nice to be here

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,920
thank you for the invitation

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,800
um so i am dr edan gambecki as

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,840
joel said i am an assistant professor in

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,199
computer information took

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,719
technology here at purdue i am the

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,719
very new executive director of the

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,559
purdue cybersecurity education training

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,159
network resources

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,200
which is a non-credit

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,000
academic unit in the polytechnic that

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,560
does

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,080
cyber security training so cyber

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,159
security certifications

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,600
and subsecurity short courses for

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,759
mainly our main target is professionals

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,400
who are interested in upskilling

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,159
and i'm also the director of the

41
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,320
cybersecure behavior lab which is what i

42
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,680
run my research out of

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,840
my research is at the intersection of

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,079
cyber security and human factors

45
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,640
so i look at cybersecurity education as

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,400
joel said i spent a lot of time looking

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,759
at cyber security curriculum

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,920
and how we teach people about cyber

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,880
security

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,960
but i also spend a lot of time thinking

51
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,920
about

52
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,520
cyber secure behavior how do we get

53
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,040
people to be safer

54
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
online how do we get people to be um

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,920
to engage in cyber hygiene and then the

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,920
flip side of that

57
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,240
social engineering right so i actually

58
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,560
teach a course a graduate course

59
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,079
uh training social engineering

60
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,038
penetration testers if any of you are

61
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,959
looking for a really cool course to take

62
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,040
it brings together

63
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,920
psychology and information technology

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,800
and

65
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,200
all kinds of other things acting do a

66
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,720
little bit of acting in there

67
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,160
and management and ethics and

68
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,599
all sorts of things and you get to do a

69
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,680
really cool project where you get to do

70
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,040
some social engineering penetration

71
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,040
testing so

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,280
i've had a little bit of experience in

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,400
that field

74
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,560
so that's basically what i'm going to

75
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,760
talk about today

76
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,480
how do we train our social engineering

77
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,920
penetration testers so how do we

78
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,640
understand

79
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,040
what makes somebody a good social

80
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,120
engineering penetration testers

81
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,440
right um so we refer

82
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,920
to um social engineers as human hackers

83
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,120
because basically instead of hacking

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,159
the software hardware in a security

85
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:02,800
system

86
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,680
they are targeting the human elements of

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,120
a security system

88
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,159
okay so i'd just like to say please feel

89
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,400
free to ask questions as we go if

90
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,599
anything

91
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,080
pops up you can put it down in the chat

92
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,280
or you can just unm your mic i think yes

93
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,720
i think we're a small enough group that

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,080
you don't need to raise your hand you

95
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,120
can just unmute your mic

96
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,159
and ask a question and i should be able

97
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,040
to

98
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,560
answer that as we go all right

99
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,040
let's see so i'm working with several

100
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,480
screens here

101
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,400
all right okay so why do we care about

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,799
this

103
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,720
so social engineering is one of those

104
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,080
growing areas right um

105
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,000
i think we're all familiar most of us

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,840
are in the cyber security space

107
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,360
we know that cybercrime costs companies

108
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,680
and institutions a lot of money

109
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,879
uh the estimate for 2020 over trillion

110
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,400
dollars globally and organizations are

111
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,280
spending

112
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,400
more and more money both training their

113
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,959
employees to combat cyber crime

114
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,439
and putting in systems right to protect

115
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,319
their employees

116
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,279
and their assets from cyber crime and

117
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,040
you find that social engineering is one

118
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,519
of those areas of massive growth

119
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,560
right so if you think about um things

120
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,479
like fishing and ransomware

121
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,520
uh fishing smishing right

122
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,919
even just simple things like tailgating

123
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,440
right walking into a building

124
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,240
behind somebody or shoulder surfing

125
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,919
right identity theft is usually the

126
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,479
result

127
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,120
of forms of social engineering it shows

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,680
up in a lot of places

129
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,240
right and currently companies are

130
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
spending about 30 percent

131
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,600
of their budgets on some element of

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,440
social engineering attack

133
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,120
because uh i believe the estimate is 87

134
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,680
of cyber attacks that result in cyber

135
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,479
breaches

136
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,960
use some element of social engineering

137
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,280
so they're rarely exclusively a social

138
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,960
engineering attack but there is some

139
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,479
element of social engineering

140
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,639
built in there right um

141
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,880
so if you look at something like the ceo

142
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,919
scam

143
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,840
right so that that's that email scam or

144
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,000
they've been one or two cases where it

145
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,120
was done over the phone

146
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,039
so you could consider that a wishing

147
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,639
scan where

148
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,039
um the malicious attacker pretends to be

149
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,960
the ceo of a company or the cfo

150
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,240
and asks somebody else in the company

151
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,919
usually the accounting department

152
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,880
to pay an invoice or to transfer money

153
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,160
to a new account

154
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,440
right uh approximately 1.2 billion

155
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,479
dollars was lost to that scam alone

156
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,919
in the space of one year right um

157
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,160
over a hundred banks have lost money to

158
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,440
spear fishing that is

159
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,479
targeted fishing attacks that are

160
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,160
tailored specifically

161
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,560
for a particular individual have

162
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,800
resulted in over a billion dollars

163
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,080
in losses i believe that was in 2019 um

164
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
and social media accounts are

165
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,919
compromised daily

166
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,960
all the time right using farming using

167
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,039
watering holes using account hijacking

168
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,319
of other forms

169
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,360
so social engineering is

170
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,520
fairly prevalent and it is growing

171
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,759
um for those of you who are not familiar

172
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,039
with social engineering just to make

173
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:31,360
sure

174
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,000
that we're all on the same page this is

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,840
an attack vector that basically

176
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,120
targets like i said the human being in

177
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,680
the security system it targets that

178
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,960
individual

179
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,160
by um targeting their

180
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,440
habits things like trust right

181
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,560
targeting their emotions basically using

182
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,919
psychosocial factors right that desire

183
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:56,720
to be

184
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,639
liked that desire to reciprocate

185
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,039
kindness or if you receive a gift or

186
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,599
something you want to reciprocate

187
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,599
all of those elements can be used to

188
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,280
influence individuals

189
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,520
to compromise their own security to

190
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
compromise their own information

191
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,000
to compromise their own systems so you

192
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,280
don't actually have

193
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,440
to hack the system you can get somebody

194
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,720
to open it up for you

195
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,880
and give you access and that is social

196
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,120
engineering

197
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,360
when it comes to penetration testing

198
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,199
social engineering penetration testers

199
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,360
also are largely responsible for

200
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,720
physical security

201
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,560
so when we talk about social engineering

202
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,160
penetration testing we're also

203
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,280
talking about testing for things like

204
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,599
uh security systems that monitor people

205
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,280
so things like cameras

206
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,960
locks um swipe cards

207
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,560
those kinds of things so the physical

208
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,520
security elements that keep systems safe

209
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,560
are generally considered part of social

210
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,879
engineering

211
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,160
right so

212
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,039
why is social engineering so very very

213
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,960
successful

214
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,680
and it basically boils down to three

215
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,800
factors

216
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,720
right the first one being that

217
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,479
social engineering is highly adaptable

218
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,919
right even if you

219
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,120
introduce new policies new security

220
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,759
systems

221
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,440
the social engineering attacker

222
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,760
can find new ways as long as there is a

223
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,559
human being

224
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,039
somewhere in the system we can find a

225
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,479
new way to get

226
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,360
to that particular individual or group

227
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,640
of people

228
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,279
right and that is because people are

229
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,480
predictable

230
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,839
people have fixed habits uh people

231
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,640
are lazy right people tend to value

232
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,519
convenience

233
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,600
over pretty much anything else right

234
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,640
convenience over

235
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,279
privacy convenience over security that's

236
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:01,760
one of

237
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,399
our biggest frustrations those of us who

238
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,000
work in human factor security

239
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,040
can have the best security system

240
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,519
but if it is inconvenient for an

241
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,560
individual

242
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,800
for example you know you can put in

243
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,440
these computerized locks with swipe

244
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,000
access

245
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,640
or that require code or whatever it is

246
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,320
but if you have a smoker on your staff

247
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,120
who is

248
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,760
you know going out every hour or two

249
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,800
hours

250
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,680
to grab a smoke they're going to prop

251
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,560
the door open

252
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,880
rather than want to swipe in and enter

253
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,240
their code every time

254
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,959
and that compromises your security right

255
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,959
as long as there is a human being

256
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,519
within the system they can be

257
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,440
manipulated

258
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,200
and the third factor that makes social

259
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,680
engineering so very very successful

260
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,160
is that very large attack surface and

261
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,640
the multiplicity of attack vectors

262
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,560
right so we have um

263
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,959
over uh seven billion

264
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,920
cell phone subscriptions right there are

265
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,200
actually

266
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,040
as many cell phone subscriptions as

267
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,399
there are people

268
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,240
on the globe which is interesting

269
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,440
because i believe

270
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,160
only about 30 something percent of

271
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,519
people actually have cell phones so

272
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,720
there's a huge amount of people with

273
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,120
multiple cell phones out there

274
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,959
um you have uh 3.9 billion

275
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,600
internet connected users right so

276
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,360
connecting to the internet on various

277
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,560
devices

278
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,800
uh be it computers laptops

279
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,320
phones or some internet of thing

280
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,519
connected device and you have

281
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,680
a approximately two billion social media

282
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,320
users

283
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,560
right so these are lots and lots of

284
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,399
people that you have access to in

285
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,320
cyberspace that you can target

286
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,800
in lots of different ways right so

287
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,000
basically you are

288
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,040
only limited by your access to the

289
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,480
individuals

290
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,640
and your imagination when it comes to

291
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,880
social engineering

292
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,480
which is one of the things that makes it

293
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,040
really cool

294
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
so social engineering penetration

295
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,680
testing thank goodness is becoming a

296
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,920
more regular part of penetration testing

297
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,880
right and basically we are undergoing

298
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,480
these simulated attacks that are

299
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,399
intended to identify

300
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,839
our vulnerabilities to social

301
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,680
engineering before those vulnerabilities

302
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,519
can be exploited

303
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,880
and the anatomy of a social engineering

304
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,839
penetration test

305
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,880
looks very like the anatomy of any

306
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,640
social engineering attack

307
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,200
right that's what penetration testing is

308
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,360
so

309
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,120
you always start with um your

310
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,360
preparation right you gather information

311
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,639
information is the lifeblood of a social

312
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,800
engineer i think depends

313
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,079
on the quality of the information

314
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,760
that you have and your access to the

315
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,079
individuals in question

316
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,160
so you gather your information and you

317
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,600
figure out what are the most

318
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,800
reasonable attack vectors right so

319
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,320
gathering that information helps you

320
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,079
pick your targets

321
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,240
and identify new sources of information

322
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,519
so you can create your attack vectors

323
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,079
develop relationships with them right

324
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,680
because most of social engineering is

325
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,720
based on

326
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,680
interactions with other individuals and

327
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,279
once you've done that you can

328
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,320
once you've established that

329
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,240
relationship you can exploit that

330
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,600
relationship

331
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,959
and keep in mind establishing a

332
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,800
relationship is something that happens

333
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,200
very often in seconds right

334
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,680
and you know you get your goal and if

335
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,560
you're doing it

336
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,200
very well you walk away and they don't

337
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,079
even know

338
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,760
that they have been compromised right

339
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,000
so we train our social engineering

340
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,360
penetration testers

341
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
so that they are able to do this and

342
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,480
identify

343
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,680
vulnerabilities so we can keep our

344
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,480
systems

345
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,600
safer so today i'm going to talk to you

346
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,760
about a study i did

347
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,680
with a group of social engineering

348
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,360
penetration testers and what i was

349
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,720
basically looking at

350
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,760
is what makes these people good at their

351
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,560
jobs

352
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,680
and how do their jobs change them

353
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,079
right how do their jobs impact their

354
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,079
lives how do they approach their jobs

355
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,720
on a daily basis right so this was a

356
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,360
two-phase

357
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,560
study it was a combination of a survey

358
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,399
which had a slightly larger group of

359
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,480
participants 20 participants we looked

360
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:38,959
at

361
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,680
the various personality traits that

362
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,480
influenced

363
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,880
these people to go into this field and

364
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,800
make them successful in this field

365
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,399
and we looked at the skills knowledge

366
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,920
and abilities that they

367
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,800
expressed and displayed right and then

368
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,959
we did interviews with a subset of these

369
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,160
participants and used thematic analysis

370
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,199
to tease out some common themes common

371
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,480
patterns

372
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,720
to start to identify um

373
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,639
elements that made them good at their

374
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,079
jobs that made them good social

375
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,040
engineers

376
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,120
so to share some demographic information

377
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,040
about this group it was 70

378
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,680
male the majority of them were actually

379
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,560
fairly young

380
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,199
these were mostly people who were

381
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,079
freshly or

382
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,800
recently out of college and then it sort

383
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,519
of

384
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,040
as the group gets older scales down

385
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,079
um there was one individual

386
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,560
two individuals who were um actually

387
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,120
over

388
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,079
46 and they were the team the two team

389
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,120
leaders

390
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,240
uh the rest of the group was like i said

391
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,720
in that 26 to 35 or 36 to 45

392
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,440
space the majority of them had a

393
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,079
background

394
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,440
in information technology

395
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,519
some of them had backgrounds in other

396
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,199
forms of engineering

397
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,360
so we had a a few electrical engineers

398
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,360
a couple industrial engineers

399
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,279
interestingly enough an environmental

400
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,440
engineer and then a few folks out of

401
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,639
computer science

402
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,160
which i thought was interesting um

403
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,680
we had somebody coming in with an

404
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,760
associate's degrees but the majority of

405
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,680
them had bachelor's degrees

406
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,760
right a couple of them had master's

407
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,680
degrees but those master's degrees were

408
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,160
not

409
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,959
actually in so they had a bachelor's in

410
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,240
either computer science or information

411
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,199
technology

412
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,000
and then a master's in um some form of

413
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,079
business administration or management

414
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,040
or something in that area and then one

415
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,120
individual with actually a phd

416
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,720
all right so this was a sort of

417
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,880
mixed team of penetration testers and

418
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,399
not all of them

419
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,120
engaged in social engineering all right

420
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,600
uh

421
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,440
james asking was their sampling bias

422
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,639
resulting in the large i.t proportion

423
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,279
there was a sampling bias because this

424
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,600
study was done with one specific

425
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,199
company right

426
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,680
so this is the breakdown for the

427
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,519
penetration testers that work for one

428
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,639
specific company

429
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,079
but it was um the majority of the work

430
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,839
that this company does

431
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,519
is uh cyber security readiness

432
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,600
so they do a lot of penetration testing

433
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,839
right

434
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,000
so yes so like i said this was actually

435
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,320
a team of penetration testers and not

436
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,279
all of them

437
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,199
engaged in social engineering right some

438
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,639
of them only

439
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,519
pitched in occasionally so you know like

440
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,360
once or twice a year

441
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,480
so about 10 percent of them did

442
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,959
less spent less than 10 percent of their

443
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:47,680
time

444
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,399
on social engineering there was a group

445
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,880
that spent about 68 of their time

446
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,240
sorry those about 68 of the group

447
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,880
spent about 30 of their time in social

448
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,160
engineering

449
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,680
um those who did the majority

450
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,079
like almost exclusively only social

451
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,119
engineering

452
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,959
uh there was actually one individual who

453
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,720
did that so five percent

454
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,119
of this group right but this allowed us

455
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,039
to compare a little bit

456
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,880
amongst people who did a lot of social

457
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,720
engineering and people who did very

458
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,359
little of it

459
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,119
because in this particular work setting

460
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,919
those who did social engineering were

461
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,760
allowed to choose to do that so they

462
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,760
weren't

463
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,840
sort of assigned to be part of the

464
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,600
social engineering team or not

465
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,960
they were allowed to choose whether they

466
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,960
wanted to engage in it or not

467
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,559
all right so one of the core things we

468
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,679
were interested in

469
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,360
is what are the skills and abilities

470
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,919
that you need to be able to engage in

471
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,520
social engineering

472
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,160
now we're talking about a population

473
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,960
that had

474
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,000
a whole mix of experience

475
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
so the newest person on the team had

476
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,039
spent less than six months

477
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,400
doing social engineering the most

478
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,080
experienced person of the on the team

479
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,400
had been doing it for over 15 years

480
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,440
so this is a broad range of experience

481
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,280
that we are talking about

482
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,440
okay and

483
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,919
there were lots of things that came up

484
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,280
in terms of

485
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,360
the skills the abilities the knowledge

486
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,960
that you need to be good

487
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,960
at social engineering right so

488
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,280
one of the key things was the ability to

489
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,799
make friends

490
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,679
right being able to get people to like

491
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,720
you

492
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,799
and that comes from a combination of

493
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,320
things right

494
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,760
so being personable right so

495
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,799
being looking well put together

496
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,400
uh being polite to people being able to

497
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,160
approach people and strike up a

498
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,840
conversation

499
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,480
being able to make jokes right the

500
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,520
people said it was

501
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,600
it was really helpful if you were able

502
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,039
to be funny

503
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,320
it helps people to lower their guard

504
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,760
and want to interact with you right

505
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,240
um being able to read people is part of

506
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,160
that ability to make friends to get

507
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,600
people to like you

508
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,280
so you have to respond to the person in

509
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,919
question

510
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,600
so for example if you're approaching

511
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,039
somebody

512
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,760
um you want to look for markers like

513
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,880
do they have a particular hobby or

514
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,480
are they expressing certain

515
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,440
like belonging to certain subcultures

516
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,559
right

517
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,600
so are you approaching a jock are you

518
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,919
approaching somebody who has tons of

519
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,160
pictures of their family on their desk

520
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,520
are you approaching somebody

521
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,080
who's uh dressed in very colorful

522
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,039
clothing right

523
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,559
so a very self-expressive person

524
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,559
right the way that you approach each of

525
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,080
these individuals

526
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,080
is very different so you have to be able

527
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,400
to read somebody really quickly

528
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,039
and not just sort of their personality

529
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,240
but also their current

530
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,960
state so is somebody in a bad mood is

531
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,520
somebody

532
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,799
really busy um is somebody in a really

533
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,000
good mood

534
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,520
right you approach those people

535
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,159
differently in order to get them to like

536
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:16,720
you

537
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,120
right so if somebody is tends to be

538
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,159
grumpy

539
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,400
and you approach them with the bubbly

540
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,280
sunniness

541
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,400
that's going to put a grumpy person off

542
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,559
right cynics like cynics

543
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,039
you also really need to be able to

544
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,799
communicate clearly that

545
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,760
came out as one of the most important

546
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,880
factors

547
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,200
when it comes to being able to make

548
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,720
friends

549
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,919
right a second thing that came up

550
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,960
was confidence self-confidence

551
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,720
right so you need to be able to walk

552
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,559
into a situation

553
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,840
and do what you need to do right

554
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,240
you need to look like you belong there

555
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,200
and

556
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,360
not look timid right the moment that you

557
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,520
start to look like you're hesitant right

558
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
you're going to get caught so um

559
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,720
actually one of

560
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,240
the participants told a story

561
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,520
this individual said he actually learned

562
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:17,840
by

563
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,919
observation he didn't get any formal

564
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,520
training in social engineering

565
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,760
so this was his very verse very first

566
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,840
time out he had never done this before

567
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,520
and he went out with somebody with a lot

568
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,960
more experience

569
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,280
and the instructions were simple i told

570
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,799
him

571
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,280
what we're going to do is walk into this

572
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,000
building

573
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,720
so all you need to do is stand tall walk

574
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,000
with purpose

575
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,640
you're going to look like you're busy

576
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,559
and you have places to get to

577
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,679
walk right past the security guard

578
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,480
and up the stairs at the top of the

579
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,360
stairs

580
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,039
there is a hallway you're going to turn

581
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,720
right into that hallway

582
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,720
and that's all you need to do right

583
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,159
you'll get your next set of instructions

584
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,159
in that hallway just walk with purpose

585
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,600
walk with confidence and you will be

586
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,039
fine

587
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,760
so both of them start walking and then

588
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
he starts thinking oh my god

589
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,280
what am i doing they're gonna catch me

590
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,480
uh so as he's walking past the security

591
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,200
guard

592
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
right he's looking to see if the guy's

593
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,720
paying attention to him

594
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,360
he makes eye contact and he gets stopped

595
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,159
right his colleague who was trading him

596
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:26,480
just

597
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,240
walks right past you know looks like

598
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,000
he's busy walks with purpose

599
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,440
and of course just leaves him there

600
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,679
because if your colleague gets caught

601
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,799
um one of you still has to complete

602
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,120
the testing so i guess you leave them

603
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,240
behind

604
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,159
so that was his first experience with

605
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,679
social engineering right

606
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,440
that confidence is so important that

607
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,760
confidence is the difference

608
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,600
between somebody stopping you and

609
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,159
somebody not stopping you

610
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,600
right um being able to

611
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,280
exploit opportunities being able to

612
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,720
um see that somebody's distracted

613
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,360
and walk past them or um

614
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,159
see that somebody has left their uh

615
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,840
access card on their desk

616
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,000
and just walk past and pick it up right

617
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,400
so if you see small opportunities

618
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
right a door has been left a jar

619
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,320
somebody has just walked out of a room

620
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,600
you can just you know sneak in there

621
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,159
right if you see an opportunity come up

622
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,159
you cannot hesitate

623
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,000
to exploit that you have to be able to

624
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,960
just think on your feet respond quickly

625
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,120
act with confidence and jump in there

626
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,640
right

627
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,440
but that also means a high level of risk

628
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
tolerance

629
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,400
you need to be able

630
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,480
you can't be scared of all the time you

631
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,080
can't be scared of getting

632
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,400
caught you can't be scared of doing

633
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,000
something wrong

634
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,919
right um one of the the people i talked

635
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:56,640
to

636
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,799
likened it to um he's a he's a big

637
00:23:58,799 --> 00:23:59,679
adventure guy

638
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,720
you know he climbs mountains and

639
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,400
zip lines and skydives and so on so

640
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,520
he says that for him it is

641
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,559
a big adrenaline rush

642
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,600
right he likes risk and he likes to be

643
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,120
able to

644
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,159
do stuff that where he feels like he's

645
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,600
on the edge right which is really

646
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,440
interesting because another individual

647
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,360
on the same team i talked to says

648
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,679
he's very much not like that he's a big

649
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,559
planner

650
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,080
right and planning is another

651
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,720
skill that came up in several of these

652
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,520
interviews being able to think ahead

653
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,600
having done copious amounts of research

654
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,400
which is not always possible because

655
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,520
usually

656
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
when penetration testers in the field

657
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,360
get these assignments they only have two

658
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,440
or three days to prep

659
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,799
for these things so being able to

660
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,440
gather information very quickly come up

661
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,799
with plans

662
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,039
right and contingency plans for your

663
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,679
plans come up with scripts

664
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,559
that you can use right being disciplined

665
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,840
in your approach

666
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,600
what are the vulnerabilities that i want

667
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,080
to test how do those connect

668
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,000
to the targets that i am looking at how

669
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,240
do those connect to the various attack

670
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,039
vectors

671
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,799
that i am planning on right so

672
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,600
being able to do that is really some

673
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,320
people

674
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,679
go for that high risk tolerance

675
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,760
right that's connected to that

676
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,120
adrenaline rush

677
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,360
and some people are able to deal with

678
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,279
that high risk tolerance by planning

679
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,080
ahead

680
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,320
right they mitigate the risk by planning

681
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,840
ahead

682
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,520
okay um another skill is

683
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,760
actually this came up in almost every

684
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,200
interview

685
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,080
um i think only two people in this set

686
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,720
actually had

687
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,279
any acting experience at all and you

688
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:57,840
know

689
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,000
one of the most common attack vectors in

690
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,960
social engineering

691
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,440
especially if you're doing uh personal

692
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,799
attacks right for using

693
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,159
in-person attack vectors is

694
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,880
impersonation right being able to

695
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,720
pretend that you are somebody that you

696
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,240
are not

697
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,279
and across the board people said you're

698
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:15,600
not

699
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,559
actually acting like a completely

700
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,159
different individual what you're trying

701
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:20,960
to do is

702
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,159
be a different be a version of yourself

703
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,520
right all of us have very many facets

704
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,520
even those of us who are extreme

705
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,799
introverts

706
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,120
can be extroverted right in the right

707
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,400
situations and

708
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,559
given the right recovery time and

709
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,200
warning

710
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,760
we all know in certain situations how to

711
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,799
be friendly

712
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,679
in other situations how to be not so

713
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:46,880
friendly

714
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,039
right how to put people off

715
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,159
you know how to project authority right

716
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,720
so basically you're playing into

717
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,080
who you are so for example

718
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,200
um i think a great example that one of

719
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,400
the

720
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,440
people i interviewed gave is this was a

721
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,960
younger um gentleman

722
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,320
uh about two years out of college

723
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,039
with you know the baby face okay and he

724
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,279
says so what he plays into very often is

725
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,880
being an intern

726
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,679
right so um he tries to pick

727
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,919
impersonations that have him being

728
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,640
new to a company and that mean that he

729
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,240
gets to that means he can play into

730
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
ignorance he can wander into places and

731
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,559
say

732
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,760
oh um you here i was just trying to find

733
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,720
my way around

734
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,320
or um he can ask for help

735
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,080
you know and people will give him more

736
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,360
help and more access

737
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,960
because he is new right

738
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,440
so he plays into the baby face another

739
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,080
example

740
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,200
is um one of the women on the team right

741
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,240
she says there are stereotypes about

742
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,080
women their expectations about women she

743
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,520
happens to be she's like you know i

744
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,279
happen to be a very pretty girl

745
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,440
and that works for me because i'm a

746
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,840
pretty girl i play into that

747
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,320
right there is another member on the

748
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,120
team who

749
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,720
is a very large gentleman six five

750
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,840
you know over 200 pounds linebacker in

751
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,559
college

752
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,840
right he looks he really stands out

753
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,399
and so that can be an asset and a

754
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,360
detriment

755
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,320
right so it's an asset in um so for

756
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,520
example when they're in

757
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,799
military settings right um

758
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,200
it helps him to our settings where you

759
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,640
find a lot of

760
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,799
a personalities lots of military or

761
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,600
previously military folks lots of um

762
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,760
sports affiliated people right so for

763
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,440
example if they're testing

764
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,039
sports franchises or stadiums right

765
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,640
he fits in there and he can connect with

766
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,200
people

767
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,279
and make them comfortable and make them

768
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,520
think he is part of that

769
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,159
setting right but in an office

770
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,600
environment in a corporate environment

771
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,240
he tends to not do very well because he

772
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,279
stands out

773
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,399
so much right so play in

774
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,520
playing into who you are

775
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,840
is really helpful as a social engineer

776
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
being persistent another thing that came

777
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,000
up

778
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,640
pretty much

779
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,399
across the board if you try

780
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,799
different tactics if you try often

781
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,320
enough if you try hard enough you will

782
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,679
find a way in

783
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,120
that's one of the beauties of social

784
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,039
engineering so if you try something and

785
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,480
it doesn't work you try something and

786
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,440
you get caught

787
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,640
and this is one of the benefits of

788
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,799
having teammates somebody else can try

789
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,200
something else right so you need to be

790
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,919
persistent

791
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,039
in order to get in you also need to have

792
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,240
a good memory which

793
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,919
i that was one of the things that

794
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,520
surprised me when i heard it like good

795
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,200
memory really

796
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,600
um but once they explained it made total

797
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,399
sense right because you need to remember

798
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,559
um you're thinking at several levels at

799
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,840
once right

800
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,159
you're thinking about what you have to

801
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,039
achieve in a particular place or

802
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,399
you have to achieve through a particular

803
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,640
conversation you have done

804
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,840
um in most cases some previous

805
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,799
reconnaissance

806
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,520
on the targets that you are talking to

807
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,960
so you want to remember

808
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
what it is that you have learned about

809
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,159
them already

810
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,000
and your plan to exploit those things

811
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,679
but you also have to remember

812
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,840
not to reveal those things because you

813
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,039
don't want to give away that you know

814
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,880
things about them already

815
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,159
you have to remember the stuff that

816
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,480
they're telling you right

817
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,679
but also you have to remember

818
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,039
who you've already talked to and what

819
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,399
persona you were using with them right

820
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,760
so as you go through a social

821
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,840
engineering penetration test

822
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,960
it's very likely that you're going to

823
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,559
change up your persona change up your

824
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,480
impersonation depending on

825
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,000
what you're trying to achieve where you

826
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,919
are in the building what facility you're

827
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,679
targeting and so on and so forth what

828
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,200
your target

829
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,080
is into right what their job is what

830
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,840
their hobbies are and so on because you

831
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,440
want to be able to connect with them

832
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,760
so you need to be able to remember all

833
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,039
of that stuff

834
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,440
so um one of the people um one of the

835
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,120
gentlemen i was interviewing actually

836
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,799
told a story where

837
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,600
so he goes in the building and um you

838
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,840
know he gets all the way to

839
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,720
the like the c-suite right he can see

840
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,600
the ceo's office which is like the

841
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,399
big goal for this particular you know

842
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,840
the ceo wants to know

843
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,519
can you actually make it all the way to

844
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,279
the top floor to my office that was the

845
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,000
big goal for this particular engagement

846
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,880
so the office is in sight and he he

847
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,720
bumps into

848
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,760
somebody right and on this floor he's

849
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,279
impersonating um

850
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,200
an executive himself right um

851
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,720
this guy is a janitor so he bumps into

852
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,600
him and he's

853
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,679
he tries to brush him off right

854
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,200
pretending that he's an executive and

855
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,360
the guy is like wait

856
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,240
i seen you what are you doing up here

857
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,960
right

858
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,720
and he's like you know he tried to bluff

859
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,640
his way out of it but

860
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,360
what he realizes as he's doing this is

861
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,960
he had forgotten

862
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,080
that he had pretended to be

863
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,559
a security guard to get into the

864
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,679
building

865
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,840
and had had to walk past this janitor

866
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,679
right so this janitor has seen him

867
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,760
as a security guard on the first floor

868
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,200
he has made it all the way

869
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,080
it was like a you know 20 30 something

870
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,440
floor building he's made it all the way

871
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,240
up there

872
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,760
and he's pretending to be an executive

873
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,279
and this person remembered him

874
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,320
and he was blown right so you have to

875
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,000
remember who you've interacted with and

876
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,519
what you said to them

877
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,440
and so it's a lot of different moving

878
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,919
parts that you have to keep track of

879
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,120
right and then there are the physical

880
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,480
skills that you need

881
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,880
um being able to pick pockets do quick

882
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,519
lifts

883
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,960
right being able to pick locks um

884
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,080
and get past not just the

885
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,919
mechanical locks but also different

886
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,399
kinds of locking mechanisms right so

887
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,760
that's like basic information you have

888
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,080
to know

889
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,919
um those are the things that are going

890
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:18,960
to come up

891
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,080
sort of that you're going to have to

892
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,320
improvise so you don't have to know them

893
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,960
on the spot um there are other skills

894
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,640
that are useful to have

895
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,760
if you're a member of a social

896
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,919
engineering team so things like being

897
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,240
able to forge documents

898
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,880
right um is really useful being really

899
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,279
good

900
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,200
at open source intelligence so gathering

901
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,559
information

902
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,919
is also very useful um

903
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,799
acting like i said because most of the

904
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,120
time you're being a version of yourself

905
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,480
rather than pretending to be somebody

906
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,240
else it can be useful to have acting

907
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,600
skills but

908
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,960
um you can get along without them

909
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,799
but what you do need to be able to do is

910
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,799
improvise right so improvisation

911
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,960
slightly different skill set but it's

912
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,559
really important to be able to

913
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,399
you know react and think on you on your

914
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,159
feet right

915
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,639
and then having the right look that was

916
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,399
another thing that came up across the

917
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,119
board

918
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,879
having that right look being

919
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,359
um able to fit it so uh

920
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,560
well like their little details

921
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,440
right can give you away so one of the

922
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,399
people i was talking to

923
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,760
told a story um he was impersonating a

924
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,480
courier right to get into this company

925
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,280
uh

926
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,079
couriers delivery people tend to be able

927
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:36,800
to get in

928
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,079
a lot of places and

929
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,639
he had

930
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,119
the logo on his shirt right

931
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,679
but it was printed on whereas the

932
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,000
company that he was impersonating

933
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,280
their logos were embroidered onto the

934
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,639
shirt

935
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,800
right and somebody noticed

936
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,480
right so he was talking to somebody and

937
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,240
he's like okay so i was talking to this

938
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,960
person

939
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,240
and they kept looking at me like

940
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,839
something was off like they're trying to

941
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,839
you know so i'm thinking to myself

942
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,440
have they seen me before are they trying

943
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,200
to remember me um

944
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,280
what's going on right so because the

945
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,760
person kept looking at him like

946
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,560
you know and then the person's like huh

947
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,480
you could see like the moment when it

948
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,280
clicked

949
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,760
what was bothering them and they're like

950
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,119
hey don't you guys have

951
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,280
embroidery on your shirt and he just

952
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,000
threw him and he didn't know what to say

953
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,560
and he was blown right so sometimes

954
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,480
little details like that having the

955
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:38,960
right

956
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,240
look can get you through

957
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,880
all kinds of doors but sometimes just

958
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,800
the wrong details somewhere

959
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,400
can get you blown right obviously like

960
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,240
all penetration testing a lot of the

961
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,280
stuff that you do

962
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,119
is confidential so being able to keep

963
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,280
secrets is really important

964
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,560
and because physical security is tied

965
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,240
into social engineering penetration

966
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,280
testing

967
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,320
geometry is actually also really

968
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:06,880
important

969
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,000
you need to be able to figure out

970
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,400
the right camera angles or things placed

971
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,280
in the right place

972
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,920
right so that's a lot of it basically

973
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,040
comes down to

974
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,119
geometry which again i was i was

975
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,599
surprised to learn

976
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,880
so looking at all of this what i found

977
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,040
really interesting is that there is this

978
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,839
duality right you have

979
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,480
to be able to blend in but you also have

980
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,640
to be able to stand out

981
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
you need to be very disciplined but you

982
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,800
need to be really flexible

983
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,520
right you need to have um you need to be

984
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,720
able to plan

985
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,280
really well but you also need to be able

986
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,800
to improvise

987
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,839
right and so looking through

988
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,760
these sets of interviews and having

989
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,680
listened to all these people

990
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,759
one of the things that emerged is this

991
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,440
idea of duality and they're basically

992
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,160
two types of social engineers

993
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,720
right there are those who are more

994
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,839
improvisational

995
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,520
right more fly by the seat of their

996
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,280
pants um

997
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,200
they tend to be outgoing

998
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,920
confident right good at improvising um

999
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,040
really good at uh sort of just getting

1000
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,480
in there

1001
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,920
really flexible right

1002
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,880
high risk taking individuals and then

1003
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,440
you have

1004
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,960
another set of social engineers right

1005
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,880
who are planners right

1006
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,800
they are better they tend to be really

1007
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,560
good at reading people

1008
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,240
they're really good at getting people to

1009
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,000
like them right

1010
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,720
they have really good um like physical

1011
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,359
skills

1012
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,760
they're good at exploiting opportunities

1013
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,400
right

1014
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,680
so there's sort of these dual types

1015
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,440
and these dual types are also there was

1016
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,960
well i'm not going to say the result of

1017
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,119
dual trading but they tend to emerge

1018
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,440
from dual train you have your sort of

1019
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,960
natural learner

1020
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,839
in social engineering where social

1021
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,680
engineering is basically part of

1022
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,880
their lifestyle right um

1023
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,800
so one of the

1024
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,480
young women on the team was actually

1025
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,880
telling me that

1026
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,599
for her social engineering was just such

1027
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,119
a natural fit

1028
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,000
because it's what she's always done

1029
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,720
right

1030
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,880
she always just walks into places

1031
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
talks her way into things talks her way

1032
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,640
out of things she's actually telling me

1033
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,520
the story of

1034
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,680
um she actually used to smuggle drugs

1035
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,640
right which i thought was so fascinating

1036
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,599
so she said

1037
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,920
she used to smuggle drugs on planes

1038
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,280
before she became you know a

1039
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,720
professional social engineer

1040
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,160
in her misspent youth she would fly

1041
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,520
you know uh to another state

1042
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,720
um pick up the drugs

1043
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,079
and just walk them past the tsa

1044
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,800
right so it's like how do you do that

1045
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,760
and she's like it's

1046
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,359
most you know it's a little bit of

1047
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,359
planning a little bit of confidence a

1048
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,480
little bit of

1049
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,480
distraction right um playing into

1050
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,079
a stereotype you know are you the pretty

1051
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,119
girl are you the um friendly girl right

1052
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,480
are you flirty

1053
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,920
you know you pick a stereotype and you

1054
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,520
play into it and use it as

1055
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,520
a distraction so people aren't paying

1056
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,640
attention to you

1057
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,440
right a little bit of planning like you

1058
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,079
need to know

1059
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,520
sort of what are the security measures

1060
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,280
for example they have dogs

1061
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,240
what are you going to use to set off the

1062
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:48,960
to distract

1063
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,000
the the dog's scent right

1064
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,119
and confidence you don't look like

1065
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,079
you're doing anything

1066
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,000
wrong walk with confidence

1067
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,200
and people will let you through right

1068
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,000
so for her you know when she stopped

1069
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,160
that stuff and you know became a

1070
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,000
more law-abiding member of society

1071
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,359
social engineering was

1072
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,920
you know she went into that morphed into

1073
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,040
going into security

1074
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,960
and then social engineering was perfect

1075
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,640
for her because she already had

1076
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,839
all of those skills

1077
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,720
a lot of people develop these skills

1078
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,960
because they have

1079
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,920
it's called complicated home lives right

1080
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,200
so

1081
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,920
if you have parents or family members or

1082
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,280
you grew up in an environment

1083
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,839
where you need to be able to talk your

1084
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:44,720
way out of things

1085
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,400
either because your home is unstable

1086
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,680
or because your home is very strict

1087
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,599
right so the only way that you are able

1088
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,599
to get any freedom or whatever

1089
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,880
is to be able to you know lie and fib

1090
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,480
and assemble and so on

1091
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,800
those people also tend to be really good

1092
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,160
at social engineering

1093
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,440
right and then you have the people who

1094
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,359
for whatever reason are just able to

1095
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,520
pick it up

1096
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,720
right they can be flexible they can

1097
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,200
remember people they can read people

1098
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
right it's just some people like all

1099
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,760
personality traits some people just have

1100
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,920
more natural talent at this than others

1101
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,119
um yes i'm going to pause here and say

1102
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,839
any questions

1103
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,040
yeah all right so um

1104
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,880
from the survey we actually um asked

1105
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,480
some of these questions and tried to

1106
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,200
quantify some of these things

1107
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,640
you can see the most important

1108
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,400
characteristics across the board were

1109
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,000
empathy high risk tolerance

1110
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and confidence right and whether that

1111
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,599
risk tolerance like i said

1112
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,119
comes from a

1113
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,960
desire to whether that risk tolerance

1114
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,640
comes from a desire from

1115
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,280
for adrenaline from being an adrenaline

1116
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,480
junkie or it comes

1117
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,280
from being confident in your ability to

1118
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,800
plan and think ahead

1119
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,280
and have contingencies right so if

1120
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,520
anything happens you know what to do

1121
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,440
it comes from confidence and it comes

1122
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,560
from and then

1123
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,119
you also require empathy those were sort

1124
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,480
of the three most important

1125
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,680
characteristics

1126
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:33,440
that came up in terms of skill um

1127
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,880
all right it's very easy to assume that

1128
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,520
something like

1129
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,599
enjoying being the center of attention

1130
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,560
or being a huge

1131
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,119
extrovert would be essential to be a

1132
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,319
social engineer

1133
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:45,599
but our testing actually showed that

1134
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,920
that was not the case

1135
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,240
the group was pretty evenly split into

1136
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,119
extroverts and

1137
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,000
introverts right and it goes back to

1138
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,839
that being who you are

1139
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,359
it's okay to be an introvert you play

1140
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,280
into who you are you can still connect

1141
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,160
to people

1142
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,960
right um extroverts tend to get a little

1143
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,280
bit

1144
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,760
more attention and then if you play into

1145
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,280
that you connect to people in different

1146
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,160
ways

1147
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,680
so it's being able to use who you are

1148
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,240
to achieve your goals in terms of skills

1149
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,480
there's some i want to point out here

1150
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,880
the ability to manipulate others

1151
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,560
scored highly where the ability to

1152
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,079
control others

1153
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,560
scored low right and this is really

1154
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,400
interesting because we actually measured

1155
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,359
these people

1156
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,599
on what we call the dark triad now the

1157
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,079
dark triad has been used for many many

1158
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,839
many years there's so many studies

1159
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,880
that show this is a reliable um

1160
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,000
indicator of criminality right a

1161
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,280
reliable predictor

1162
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,440
or it correlates significantly with

1163
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,480
criminality

1164
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,160
and when you have something like

1165
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,839
penetration testing where you're

1166
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,040
essentially

1167
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,240
taking the role of a malicious actor

1168
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,800
you would assume that it it would

1169
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,319
attract people

1170
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:02,240
right who have tendencies to criminality

1171
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,760
but for whatever reason are staying on

1172
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,960
the right side of the law

1173
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,920
right it turns out that is not actually

1174
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,720
the case

1175
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,280
right so if you look at machiavellianism

1176
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,040
machiavellianism is that

1177
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,000
desire or ability to strategically

1178
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,800
exploit

1179
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,200
and deceive others right that sounds

1180
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,920
like exactly what social engineering is

1181
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,319
um

1182
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:23,760
but if you look over here i don't know

1183
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,839
if you can actually see my cursor

1184
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,760
right the norm so the

1185
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,200
across the population right um

1186
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,800
the average score on machiavellianism

1187
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,040
machiavellians about 3.1

1188
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,040
right in this population those who

1189
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,800
scored who uh

1190
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,160
did not like to engage in social

1191
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,880
engineering actually scored higher in

1192
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,359
machiavellianism

1193
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,200
and those who did do who did really

1194
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,680
enjoy social engineering

1195
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,800
they were right with the average

1196
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,000
right if you look at narcissism which is

1197
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,200
that

1198
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,359
arrogance you know thinking that you're

1199
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,880
the most entitled you know

1200
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,040
the most important person that idea of

1201
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,000
being self-important

1202
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,839
and entitled right um the norm

1203
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,520
in the population is 2.8 right

1204
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,040
those who scored those who did not like

1205
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,880
doing social engineering so much

1206
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,720
were right at the norm so you know this

1207
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,880
was a very average population

1208
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,560
in terms of narcissism those who were

1209
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,599
high social engineering performers right

1210
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,880
good at social engineering

1211
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,119
like to do it a lot actually scored

1212
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,720
lower in narcissism and this was

1213
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,880
actually found to be significant

1214
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,440
right so you need to be less

1215
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,319
narcissistic

1216
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,480
than the average person to be good at

1217
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,680
social engineering

1218
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,560
and the reason for that is you require

1219
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,240
empathy which is

1220
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,760
which you can think of as being the

1221
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,440
opposite of narcissism i'm gonna talk

1222
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,760
some more about that in a second and

1223
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,040
then psychopathy

1224
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,839
right so being able to be callous and

1225
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,640
cynical

1226
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,480
and not care so much about how you're

1227
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,160
affecting other people's lives

1228
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,160
which you would think is that's one of

1229
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,440
the

1230
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,040
key traits of being um social engineers

1231
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,640
are essentially scam artists right

1232
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,920
they're con artists

1233
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,560
they talk you into doing things that

1234
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,280
hurt you

1235
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,440
and help them right and they don't care

1236
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,599
that they're hurting you

1237
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,359
but what you find is the norman

1238
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,000
population is 2.4

1239
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,800
and both the low and high in this

1240
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,400
population now population of social

1241
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,240
engineering penetration testers

1242
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,200
actually score significantly lower on

1243
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,319
psychopathy

1244
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,359
so they do tend to be

1245
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,839
caring people right they are not callous

1246
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:38,960
and cynical

1247
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,480
right so what you would expect of the

1248
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,280
scammer or the con artist is really

1249
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,119
different from what you see

1250
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,640
in the penetration tester

1251
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:56,640
okay

1252
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,118
now a slightly more useful

1253
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,400
um set of personality traits is this

1254
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,640
idea of spheres of control

1255
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,040
right now spheres of control can be

1256
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,160
thought of as

1257
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,640
how do you interact with the people

1258
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,319
around you how do you

1259
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,400
persuade them or influence them to do

1260
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,520
what you want them to do

1261
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,880
right so there is personal control which

1262
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,000
is control over yourself

1263
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,079
of the non-social environment which

1264
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,760
we're not so concerned about well

1265
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,440
we are a little bit concerned about that

1266
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,280
because it plays into those ideas

1267
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,480
of being disciplined and organized and

1268
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,800
being able to self-regulate and so on

1269
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,559
but we're more interested in this idea

1270
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:36,960
of

1271
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,079
influence right so interpersonal control

1272
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,359
control over other people right and what

1273
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,400
you see here

1274
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,599
is that our population of social

1275
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,280
engineering penetration testers

1276
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,359
right good successful social engineering

1277
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,280
penetration testers who enjoy doing it

1278
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,000
tend to score significantly higher in

1279
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,839
interpersonal control

1280
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,040
than the average person and what this

1281
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,440
indicates is that these individuals

1282
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,559
do enjoy or have the ability

1283
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,920
to manipulate others but

1284
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,960
rather than that machiavellianism which

1285
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,240
is about exploitation

1286
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,000
and deceit right they tend to use more

1287
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,880
mechanisms of influence so nudging

1288
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,079
people

1289
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,760
to do what you want right and it tends

1290
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,480
to be

1291
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,599
more ethically bound and more

1292
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,079
um caringly designed

1293
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,720
okay so it is not malicious in action

1294
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,880
all right when it comes to skills

1295
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,119
right another thing i want to point out

1296
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,680
that technical skills are really not

1297
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,359
that important when it comes to social

1298
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,160
engineering

1299
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,040
which makes sense because the majority

1300
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,400
of what you are doing

1301
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,920
is getting people to compromise their

1302
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,720
security for you

1303
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,440
right so it's i mean having technical

1304
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,280
skills is great and once in a while

1305
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,640
you're going to need them

1306
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,599
but you don't really need to have a

1307
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:10,400
degree

1308
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,720
in information technology or computer

1309
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,079
science to be a good

1310
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,319
social engineering penetration tester in

1311
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:17,839
fact there are a lot of people in the

1312
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:18,480
field

1313
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,520
who have come out of um

1314
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,280
law right

1315
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,119
one of the most successful penetration

1316
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,559
testers i know is

1317
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,119
her background is in quantum physics for

1318
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,400
whatever reason

1319
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,400
um so uh there people have come out of

1320
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,760
i know a couple people came out of

1321
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,240
social work right so there are a lot of

1322
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,599
paths

1323
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,280
into cyber security and there are a lot

1324
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,880
of paths into social engineering

1325
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,599
specifically which makes sense because

1326
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,839
it's about dealing with people and those

1327
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,680
people skills are the most important

1328
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,800
elements of social engineering

1329
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,720
another thing i'd like to point out is

1330
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,800
good communication skills

1331
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,640
which is another um aspect

1332
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,680
of what i was talking about earlier

1333
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,920
right that um the opposite of narcissism

1334
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,160
right empathy and empathy is basically

1335
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,480
this deliberate effort to step outside

1336
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,160
of the self

1337
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,440
and into the experience of somebody else

1338
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,119
right so being able to

1339
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:26,960
figure out what somebody else is

1340
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,119
thinking and feeling

1341
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,599
right and being able to at least

1342
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,240
partially share in that experience

1343
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,920
is one of the most important skills

1344
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,119
that a social engineer can have right

1345
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,800
that's that opposite of narcissism

1346
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,160
thinking you're the most important

1347
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,119
person you need to be

1348
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,240
able to focus on the other

1349
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,800
right and in order to be able to do that

1350
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,880
you need this idea of

1351
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,040
being able to recognize that other

1352
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,079
person

1353
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,079
recognize the emotions that they're

1354
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,160
having right

1355
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,559
um develop that shared representation of

1356
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,559
those emotions

1357
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,720
you need to have the mental flexibility

1358
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,160
um you can think of it as imagination

1359
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,559
right you need to be able to imagine

1360
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,319
another person's experience

1361
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:17,599
step into their shoes and that allows

1362
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:18,160
you

1363
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,319
to connect with them that is why empathy

1364
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:22,640
is

1365
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,839
so so important and you can see um we

1366
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:26,880
tested

1367
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,839
our social engineers on empathy and

1368
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:30,960
those who are

1369
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,720
our high social engineers our good

1370
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,400
social engineers scored

1371
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,839
significantly higher in empathy

1372
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,720
than the average in the general

1373
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,599
population

1374
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,440
right so that's one of those really

1375
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,119
important skills

1376
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,240
when it comes to social engineering

1377
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,319
okay so another aspect of what we

1378
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:56,400
asked um our participants

1379
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,400
during the study is about their ethical

1380
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,440
boundaries

1381
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,240
right so essentially what they engage in

1382
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,520
um

1383
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,200
on a daily basis as they're doing the

1384
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,880
penetration test is

1385
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,400
manipulation and deception right

1386
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,960
and a lot of them expressed that it was

1387
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,760
it could be

1388
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,839
difficult for them because

1389
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,599
the people who tend to be most

1390
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,920
susceptible to social engineering

1391
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,000
uh the people who are kind people who

1392
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,440
are nice the people who are trying to be

1393
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,160
helpful

1394
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,680
right because those are some of the

1395
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,400
easiest things to exploit

1396
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,000
so um does anybody

1397
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,040
remember the case of

1398
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,079
the saldana

1399
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:47,760
no it's it's really kind of hard when

1400
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,520
you can't see your audience

1401
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:54,400
all right so this um she was a nurse

1402
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,240
in a hospital in england when the

1403
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,960
duchess of cambridge was having her

1404
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,720
last child i believe and a couple of djs

1405
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,240
from australia actually called the

1406
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,400
hospital

1407
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,760
and pretended to be

1408
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,760
the queen and asked for her medical

1409
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,960
information

1410
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,520
and this uh nurse actually turned that

1411
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,559
information over

1412
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,640
right and they did it live on the air

1413
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,319
and she was you know when she found out

1414
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:25,359
she was very embarrassed

1415
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,640
she actually ended up committing suicide

1416
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,040
right that would be an extreme

1417
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,400
version an extreme example of how social

1418
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,400
engineering can result in some very

1419
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,240
negative impacts on individuals

1420
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,440
and those negative impacts are not

1421
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,240
uncommon

1422
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,319
right usually after social engineering

1423
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:49,359
engagement

1424
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,359
there is some sort of debriefing right

1425
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,920
where the employees are told okay so

1426
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,079
somebody came in and tested you on this

1427
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,359
that and the other and these are the

1428
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,319
things we found

1429
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,520
so we're going to you know change

1430
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,079
policies in this way or whatever it is

1431
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,319
and so when you find out that you have

1432
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,160
been lied to

1433
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,520
you have been deceived you have been

1434
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,599
manipulated it can make you

1435
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,880
feel awful right makes you feel

1436
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,200
stupid it makes you feel small it makes

1437
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,480
you feel like you can't trust

1438
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,960
people anymore right and that is

1439
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,680
something

1440
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,359
that social engineers know and something

1441
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,119
that they have to deal with

1442
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,359
and so ethics you know ethical

1443
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:26,319
boundaries are

1444
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,319
really important when it comes to social

1445
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,680
engineering

1446
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,440
so we asked these social engineers about

1447
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,359
their how they approach their ethics

1448
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,480
right um

1449
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,160
so in the professional setting what was

1450
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,160
interesting was most of them thought

1451
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,079
about social engineering

1452
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,359
in their professional lives and their

1453
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,280
personal lives very separately

1454
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,119
right so in their professional lives

1455
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,079
they tended to stick to their contract

1456
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,079
which i guess makes a lot of sense

1457
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,559
i don't know if you've most of you are

1458
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,240
familiar with the coal fire

1459
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,760
case coal fire was a cyber security

1460
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,720
company

1461
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,839
and one of the things they did was

1462
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:09,760
social engineering penetration testing

1463
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,880
they were hired by

1464
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,400
the state of iowa to do penetration

1465
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,079
testing

1466
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,880
at various uh municipal buildings across

1467
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,520
the state

1468
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,720
um one of them was a courthouse

1469
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,920
a county courthouse right so they go

1470
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,280
into the courthouse

1471
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,040
uh they they were able to get in

1472
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,839
successfully

1473
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:35,520
um and as they were going through they

1474
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,119
set off an alarm

1475
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,000
right so they come out of the building

1476
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,480
and

1477
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,640
you know the sheriffs have and the

1478
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,079
deputies have pulled up

1479
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,440
and you know they get arrested they give

1480
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,880
themselves up

1481
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,280
and they say you know where well they

1482
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,040
didn't get arrested they got detained

1483
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,960
and they said uh they explained what

1484
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,480
they were doing there

1485
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,000
right and usually what happens

1486
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,440
is you explain what you're doing there

1487
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,200
you show them your what we call the get

1488
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,040
out of jail free card right this letter

1489
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,000
that says

1490
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
this letter that's from whoever hired

1491
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,599
you to do this it says

1492
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,200
they have permission to do this this is

1493
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,559
what they're doing you know penetration

1494
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,799
testing please leave them be

1495
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:18,240
so they showed their letter

1496
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,559
but the sheriff refused to accept it and

1497
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,079
arrested them anyway

1498
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,720
so they actually got arrested and spent

1499
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,319
several nights in jail

1500
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:30,240
because um there was some confusion

1501
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,440
as to what they were allowed to do

1502
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,760
um according to their contract right

1503
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,559
there were

1504
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,160
contradictions within the contract

1505
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,680
number one and number two

1506
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,119
um the courthouse they were testing

1507
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,720
the sheriff claimed it was a county

1508
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,400
courthouse it was under the county

1509
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,200
jurisdiction

1510
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,760
and the state did not have permission

1511
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,119
did not have the

1512
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,559
um ability to give them permission to be

1513
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:55,920
in there

1514
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,520
right so they ended up spending some

1515
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,280
time in jail right and it became like a

1516
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,000
whole

1517
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,960
thing so all these social engineers they

1518
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:03,359
say

1519
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:06,160
we are really careful to stay within the

1520
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:06,799
bounds

1521
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:10,480
of our contract right we try not to be

1522
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,520
too sensitive to others

1523
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,319
and we try to remember that the reason

1524
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:17,599
that we're doing this

1525
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,480
is to improve everybody's security

1526
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,160
improving everybody's security

1527
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,240
makes everybody safer it saves money for

1528
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,280
the company

1529
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,760
it keeps people from being the victims

1530
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,359
of cyber breaches

1531
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,960
and identity theft and all of those

1532
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,400
things that go with that

1533
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,640
so basically most of them approach it

1534
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,799
from um

1535
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:39,680
one of two or a combination of two sort

1536
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,640
of ethical

1537
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,960
viewpoints the first being the dirty

1538
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,920
hands

1539
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,079
if you're not familiar walter's dirty

1540
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:47,520
hands theory of ethics

1541
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,480
basically says that boils down to

1542
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,520
you can do something that

1543
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:02,480
seems ethically dubious and

1544
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,920
assume the moral guilt that goes with

1545
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,480
that

1546
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,799
if the results are beneficial so

1547
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:10,079
basically it's uh

1548
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:13,599
sometimes the means justify the ends

1549
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,599
argument and then there's also the

1550
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,599
utilitarian argument which i think

1551
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,040
most people are familiar with that

1552
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:23,040
basically says

1553
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,000
we want to maximize benefits right the

1554
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,200
most benefits for the most

1555
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,799
so we are going to do what we need to do

1556
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,319
and it's ethical as long

1557
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:37,760
as it maximizes security for as many

1558
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,720
people as possible

1559
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,040
when it comes to their personal lives it

1560
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,760
becomes a little bit more interesting

1561
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,000
so the majority not the entire

1562
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,760
population but the majority of the

1563
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,880
people i talked to

1564
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,599
the individuals i interviewed did

1565
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,440
actually use a lot of these social

1566
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,960
engineering techniques

1567
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,839
in their personal lives right so i got

1568
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:04,799
stories like

1569
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,760
one individual said uh one thing he

1570
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,480
likes to do

1571
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,839
is crash parties and weddings

1572
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,440
right he uses his social engineering

1573
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,280
skills to show up at

1574
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,640
places he doesn't know anybody he goes

1575
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,720
he's not invited he makes friends he

1576
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,960
hangs out he gives them a fake name

1577
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,839
um comes the life of the party uh

1578
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:27,599
parties it up and then leaves

1579
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,160
right um another one said they have

1580
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:30,640
never

1581
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,319
had to wait they've never made a

1582
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,160
restaurant reservation and have never

1583
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,920
had to wait because they basically show

1584
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,680
up and talk their way in right they

1585
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,359
pretend they have a reservation

1586
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,040
take somebody else's reservation

1587
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,960
whatever it is

1588
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,599
another individual said he uses actually

1589
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:46,960
a couple individuals that they use

1590
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,880
social engineering techniques

1591
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,079
on dates right so

1592
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,160
when they go out on especially when

1593
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,760
they're just getting to know somebody

1594
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,440
they use social engineering a little bit

1595
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,960
um one individual said that he uses it a

1596
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:03,359
lot

1597
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:06,559
when it comes to negotiations so um

1598
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:09,520
he got almost 50 off when he replaced

1599
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,799
his roof

1600
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,880
and i think he said something like 25

1601
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,200
off when the last time he bought a car

1602
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,119
because of using his social engineering

1603
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:18,799
skills right

1604
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:21,520
so pretty much all of these people used

1605
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,359
their social engineering skills in some

1606
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:24,480
way or another

1607
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,040
in their personal lives one of the young

1608
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,400
ladies said that

1609
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,079
she likes to um this was

1610
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,319
uh as you could probably guess the

1611
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,000
individual who used to

1612
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,680
smuggle drugs she likes to try things to

1613
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,079
see

1614
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,720
if she can do them right so little

1615
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,799
things can i talk somebody into

1616
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:48,000
giving me a free ice cream cone um if i

1617
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:48,319
see

1618
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,640
like an employees only or restricted

1619
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,559
access like i'm out shopping

1620
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,280
or whatever or a doctor's office and i

1621
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,079
see

1622
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:57,920
somewhere i'm not supposed to be i like

1623
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,920
to see if i can get in there

1624
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,640
and get out without being discovered

1625
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,119
like tuck my way in and talk my way out

1626
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,160
without being challenged right so

1627
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,880
um she just likes to sort of see if she

1628
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,000
can do it

1629
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,119
right so to some extent all of them

1630
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:16,960
used their social engineering skills in

1631
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,400
their personal lives

1632
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,079
but there were still ethical boundaries

1633
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,839
and for all of them the ethical

1634
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,760
boundaries was

1635
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,960
it cannot be malicious right and it

1636
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,000
cannot be

1637
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,040
too risky so they weigh the risk and the

1638
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,079
benefits

1639
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,040
right um one individual said that every

1640
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,000
time he sees

1641
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,240
like a advert for a concert he's seen

1642
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,520
all kinds of

1643
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,359
of groups plays musicians

1644
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,520
you know every time he sees a show he

1645
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,200
tries to determine so what's the level

1646
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,480
of security even if it's

1647
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,920
a group he's never heard of he's not

1648
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,839
particularly interested in he goes to

1649
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,200
see the show and he

1650
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,720
almost never pays and he very often um

1651
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,440
goes backstage right using his social

1652
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,599
engineering skills

1653
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,359
so they do weigh sort of the risk of

1654
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,119
benefit but he says obviously i wouldn't

1655
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,520
do that if it's something for charity

1656
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,960
or if it's a very like small venue

1657
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,520
right because i do not want to cause

1658
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,000
harm

1659
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,559
to anybody and this is where the ethical

1660
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:20,240
boundary seems to be for

1661
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,359
all of them they do not want to cause

1662
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:27,200
harm right um

1663
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,799
mike is our stop at 2 30

1664
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:32,880
yeah we usually go until 2 30 but you

1665
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,839
know take your time this is a great talk

1666
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:38,079
very fascinating so you know whatever

1667
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,920
face you're at that's fine

1668
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,839
okay so i'm i'm almost done i'm almost

1669
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,119
done um

1670
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,559
so yeah so they weigh the harm

1671
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,400
in every case right and i also asked

1672
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,599
them about

1673
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,520
how this affected them as individuals

1674
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,559
right uh and most of them

1675
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,799
said that yes it had made them more

1676
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,400
deceptive right so that was one of the

1677
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,839
questions do you feel like

1678
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,000
you lie more right you deceive people

1679
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,880
more you manipulate people more

1680
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,280
and the majority of them said i tend to

1681
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,920
be i find myself being more deceptive

1682
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,559
yes but not necessarily more

1683
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,319
manipulative

1684
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:21,599
all of them said that being um a social

1685
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,359
engineering penetration tester

1686
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:26,079
and learning and honing these skills had

1687
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:28,240
definitely made them more confident

1688
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,680
right and better able to

1689
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,599
navigate relationships which i thought

1690
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,359
was really interesting so

1691
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,920
um several of them expressed having

1692
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,920
difficult relationships with

1693
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,039
family members and friends and because

1694
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:44,799
of the skills they had learned as social

1695
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:46,000
engineers these

1696
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,920
being able to empathize with others

1697
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,760
being able to read others

1698
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,599
uh being able to expose the particular

1699
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,280
facet of yourself that you feel is more

1700
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,880
appropriate is most appropriate

1701
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,839
to a particular situation

1702
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,920
this has actually helped them in their

1703
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,079
personal lives

1704
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,799
sort of lubricate these relationships

1705
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:07,920
right made them easy

1706
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,520
made it easier for them to interact with

1707
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,119
people all of them said

1708
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,359
they were now more willing and engaged

1709
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,599
much more in public speaking

1710
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,880
in you know presentations in uh

1711
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,720
teaching people right they weren't

1712
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,359
afraid to there were much even those who

1713
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,559
were

1714
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:27,359
who scored highly introverted we are

1715
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,359
were no longer afraid to be the center

1716
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:30,240
of attention

1717
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,480
for whatever reason right so it made

1718
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,480
them a lot more confident

1719
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,160
they also said it made it a lot easier

1720
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,000
for them to spot deception

1721
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,280
right um several of them expressed that

1722
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,720
they spent a lot more time

1723
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:47,039
now watching people and listening to

1724
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:49,760
not just to what people actually said

1725
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,400
right so

1726
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,119
um one of them put it i thought really

1727
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:53,760
well

1728
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,280
we spent a lot of time as people

1729
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,599
assuming what people are saying rather

1730
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,319
than actually

1731
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:01,200
listening to what they're saying and

1732
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,160
people's word

1733
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,920
choice uh people's non-verbal

1734
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,920
communication all of that

1735
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,000
conveys a lot of information that very

1736
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,359
often we miss

1737
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,200
either because we're making assumptions

1738
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,119
or we're not paying attention

1739
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:16,319
and because i'm a social engineer

1740
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:17,920
because my social engineering skills i

1741
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,160
do that a lot less so it's a lot easier

1742
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,599
for me to spot

1743
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,119
when somebody's trying to deceive me or

1744
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,079
when somebody's trying to manipulate me

1745
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:29,039
and i also ask them has this made them

1746
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:29,920
cynical

1747
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,440
right has knowing has been exposed

1748
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,119
first of all to all of these cyber

1749
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:36,559
criminals right because

1750
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,640
they deal with cyber criminals a lot and

1751
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,480
having to step into the role of being

1752
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,760
cyber criminals

1753
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,440
made them more cynical and they all said

1754
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,760
no they're all

1755
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,599
fairly optimistic they all believe still

1756
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,520
believe in people they still all believe

1757
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,079
that people are generally good

1758
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,319
and so i thought that was really

1759
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:56,480
interesting

1760
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,760
so um what are some of the

1761
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,079
general observations here um

1762
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:05,680
the most interesting one i found with

1763
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,359
social engineering

1764
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:11,039
as even more than you would expect

1765
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,160
is really really easy right

1766
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,039
um one of them uh one of them said and

1767
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:17,520
several

1768
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:21,039
others agreed the number of times

1769
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:23,119
you show up somewhere and say i have a

1770
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,240
meeting

1771
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,480
on this floor and somebody just lets you

1772
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,599
up

1773
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,640
you just ask and they will let you in is

1774
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,720
staggering it's like eight out of ten

1775
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,640
times you can just say i'm supposed to

1776
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:34,960
be

1777
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,400
i'm supposed to meet so-and-so i'm

1778
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,920
supposed to be in this room and they

1779
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:38,559
will just

1780
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:41,680
let you in right if you want to increase

1781
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,200
your success with that you could have

1782
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,880
somebody on the phone

1783
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,280
and say oh i have so and so on the phone

1784
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,559
i'm supposed to meet with them oh

1785
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,640
they're telling me to room such and such

1786
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,400
would you like to um check with them

1787
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,480
10 out of 10 times they will let you in

1788
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,240
so social engineering can be

1789
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,520
very easy um the second

1790
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,280
observation is that uh social

1791
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,799
engineering it's a lot of fun they all

1792
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:05,599
expressed

1793
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,079
they all came out of uh various

1794
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:09,280
different careers

1795
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,000
um some of them were fresh out of this

1796
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,359
was the first thing they'd done because

1797
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:14,480
they were um

1798
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,880
they just graduated right but for those

1799
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,119
who had had previous careers

1800
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:22,160
um in other aspects of cyber security

1801
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,720
all said that this was the their

1802
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,160
favorite part of their job

1803
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,839
this was the most fun thing they'd ever

1804
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:31,039
done they really really enjoyed it

1805
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:32,960
and another thing they all agreed on is

1806
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,799
that there is a way

1807
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:38,319
to get to everyone

1808
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:40,400
right you can use social engineering to

1809
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,559
get into anywhere you want given enough

1810
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:43,599
time

1811
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:46,480
and sufficient access you can figure out

1812
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,400
a way in

1813
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,160
right so they all recommend it as

1814
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,359
an excellent path if any of your cyber

1815
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:56,559
security professionals looking for

1816
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:57,920
something slightly different

1817
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,000
social engineering is a really great

1818
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,119
really interesting

1819
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:06,079
way to go all right so any questions

1820
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:07,680
or comments i'm most interested in

1821
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,839
hearing comments

1822
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,000
i know i've run out of run over time a

1823
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,399
little bit

1824
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:25,359
oh that's great talk um i've got a

1825
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:27,120
couple questions here while we let

1826
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:30,158
people type in theirs um

1827
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:32,560
actually i mean what i'm following along

1828
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,000
and all i can think about

1829
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,920
when you're you know listing all the

1830
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,279
skills and the assets

1831
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,279
is the tv show mr robot and i don't know

1832
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:40,399
if you've

1833
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:43,279
watched it or not i mean what have you

1834
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:44,238
thought of that

1835
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:45,920
okay i mean because the main character

1836
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,759
elliott i mean every

1837
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:49,439
they must you know i think they did a

1838
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:51,359
great job with it you know obviously

1839
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:52,640
there's stuff that they have to stretch

1840
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,640
or whatever but i mean it's

1841
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,000
you know when i just think of the main

1842
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,279
character and like he's hitting like

1843
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,600
every single day even to the empathy

1844
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,080
um part about it feeling bad for what

1845
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,120
he's doing you know

1846
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:07,519
in situations um

1847
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,600
what i found really interesting is there

1848
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,839
is sort of the media stereotype of the

1849
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:12,799
hacker

1850
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:15,920
i think that we're all familiar with but

1851
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,238
the social engineer tends to be

1852
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:20,880
less that and more the stereotype of the

1853
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,679
con artist

1854
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:25,040
the grifter right the scammer um or the

1855
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,238
spy

1856
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:28,000
so the con artist or the spy is the

1857
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,279
social engineer

1858
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,238
and um elliot tends to fall into both

1859
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:34,640
camps he's one of those like flexible

1860
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,198
yeah so he is he is a good avatar of a

1861
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:38,960
social engineer i think

1862
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,799
yeah uh just uh for attendees you know

1863
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:44,080
if you want to

1864
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,439
turn your mic on you can just raise your

1865
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:47,439
hand and i will turn on or you can just

1866
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:48,080
post a question

1867
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,439
in the q a um another thing i was

1868
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:54,400
wondering about is um i thought about it

1869
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,360
like when you're talking about

1870
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,800
confidence and it's like

1871
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,360
does that get skewed by you know when

1872
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,480
when you're doing

1873
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,360
uh actual social engineering test that

1874
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,360
the person knows you know okay i'm

1875
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,120
supposed to be doing this

1876
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,800
i'm not really going to go to jail but

1877
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,480
then you know you brought in the story

1878
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,199
about

1879
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:14,320
the guys that did go to jail

1880
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,000
which is how does that affect it at all

1881
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,760
yeah all right so i will say the coal

1882
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,719
fire case

1883
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:20,480
really sort of shook the entire

1884
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,239
penetration testing community especially

1885
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,760
the social engineering penetration

1886
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,880
testers

1887
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,199
because it was unusual usually

1888
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:28,960
penetration testers you know you're not

1889
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,400
going to jail right you are

1890
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,880
allowed to be there um so one of the

1891
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:33,440
things i

1892
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,320
did ask them was how do you think that

1893
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,440
you are different

1894
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:40,159
from malicious attackers and so what

1895
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:40,880
they said

1896
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:44,000
um we tend to do less

1897
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,440
reconnaissance we tend to have less time

1898
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,360
and less money to spend on our

1899
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,040
engagement so we're flying a little bit

1900
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:51,840
more

1901
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,480
by the seat of our pants and it is lower

1902
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,760
stakes because

1903
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,840
regardless of whether i get in or not i

1904
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:58,960
get paid

1905
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,520
right where the attacker has to succeed

1906
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,280
in other in order to get paid so they're

1907
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,159
willing to

1908
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,840
take more risks they're willing to go

1909
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,360
further they're willing to be more

1910
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,760
malicious because

1911
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,880
you know if they don't they don't

1912
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,760
succeed

1913
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,120
right and if they get caught they go to

1914
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,640
jail so they're they may be a little bit

1915
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,640
more careful

1916
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,000
so that's that was sort of their

1917
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,920
impression of like the difference

1918
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,960
yeah right okay it looks like we have a

1919
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:27,840
question

1920
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,800
in the q a all right so melissa's asking

1921
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,960
were there any negatives to the testing

1922
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,360
mindset i would think that it would make

1923
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,800
people more paranoid

1924
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,239
i'm not sure if i missed any mention of

1925
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,920
a negative earlier okay

1926
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,960
so um it did make them

1927
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,080
more likely to spot

1928
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,040
deception right it did make them watch

1929
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,640
people more

1930
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,000
um but it didn't i wouldn't actually

1931
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,320
call it paranoid because they all said

1932
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,080
they still believe in people right so

1933
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,520
they weren't more scared

1934
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,960
they were just more observant

1935
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:07,120
um negatives to the testing mindset

1936
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,760
um a lot of them complained about

1937
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,480
traveling

1938
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,880
a lot right because you know they're

1939
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:13,600
doing

1940
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,120
testing but that's true of any

1941
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,400
penetration tester you're going from one

1942
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,920
company to another

1943
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,280
um the other thing was what i mentioned

1944
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,880
about feeling that guilt because

1945
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,800
um you are manipulating people you're

1946
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,719
deceiving people

1947
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,560
you strike up a friendship with somebody

1948
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,400
or a fun conversation

1949
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,719
somebody or you sit and talk to somebody

1950
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:36,320
about their kids

1951
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,080
in order to connect with them and then

1952
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,360
use that to

1953
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,400
compromise them and then they find out

1954
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,760
later that that's what you were doing

1955
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,199
which makes you feel like a horrible

1956
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,000
person

1957
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,080
obviously so they said there is a lot of

1958
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,360
that guilt

1959
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,840
that comes along with it especially

1960
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,719
because

1961
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:55,920
in a few cases

1962
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,760
the people that they compromise get

1963
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,360
fired

1964
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,159
right so if the breach of security is

1965
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:04,480
fairly egregious if you really weren't

1966
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,880
if they got you to compromise policy in

1967
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,560
a large way you could actually lose your

1968
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,199
job

1969
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:11,760
which i think would feel awful for any

1970
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,640
reasonable person

1971
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,120
okay looks like i have a hand raised

1972
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:19,760
here

1973
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,000
um

1974
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:28,159
the other tv shows

1975
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:33,839
this reminds me of are the mentalists

1976
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,679
and lie to me yes

1977
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,120
a decade or so ago right yes yes um

1978
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,199
the mentalist is a little bit overblown

1979
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:44,719
like that's not

1980
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:46,640
you know it's highly exaggerated i would

1981
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,159
say lie to me

1982
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:51,600
um was actually based on paul ekman

1983
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,719
who was one of the premier uh

1984
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:56,800
researchers in the field of nonverbal

1985
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,000
communication

1986
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,920
right ever looking for research on that

1987
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,920
so the first season i think of lied to

1988
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,120
me it's really good i actually recommend

1989
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,640
my students watch it

1990
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:10,239
but uh yeah it as time went on you know

1991
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,840
it got a little bit weird um another

1992
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,719
good show

1993
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:17,840
is leverage uh

1994
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,280
so that's an american show about like

1995
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,199
grifters and thieves uh there's a

1996
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,480
british show called

1997
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,880
hustlers was it called hustlers yeah i

1998
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,239
think it's called hustlers

1999
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:28,239
um there's actually there was actually a

2000
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:30,159
show that was it was a reality show

2001
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,239
about a team of social engineers that's

2002
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:35,440
really really hard to find i've actually

2003
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,199
never been able to find it

2004
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:40,000
um because it's not online anymore oh

2005
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,120
what was it called

2006
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,560
i can't think of the name right now but

2007
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,000
there was like one season of it it's

2008
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,280
like 12 episodes

2009
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,840
of you know it was a reality show with

2010
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,880
social engineers

2011
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,600
it's really cool

2012
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,440
