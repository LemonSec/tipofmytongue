1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,960
good afternoon and welcome back to the

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,359
22nd annual serious cybersecurity

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,639
symposium

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,880
uh it is my pleasure to introduce the

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,200
next our first panel discussion of the

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,599
event uh but the idea of this panel

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,520
discussion came out of conversations

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,320
with a number of our our partners two of

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,160
them who will be participating in this

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,240
panel discussion and as mentioned

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,480
earlier by our director professor dun

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,519
young shu

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,519
is that he often refers to these to

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,000
these areas as cyber plus

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,960
cyber alone doesn't really matter it's

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,719
cyber plus

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,120
and so cyber plus arrow is an area of

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,079
great concern by many within the aero

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,800
industry the travel industry and can be

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,440
expanded to astro and train and

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,680
everything else within that area it can

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,920
broadly be even expanded out to almost

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,160
anything that is cyber physical but

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,559
certainly there are some unique

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,559
attributes to the aero industry when it

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,600
comes to cyber we joke that uh

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,040
as important as cyber automotive is if

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,799
there is a problem you can pull over

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,640
it's a little difficult for an airline

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,920
to be able to pull over if they're

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,560
having a cyber incident in flight

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,240
so with that it's my

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,360
distinct pleasure to be able to

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,280
introduce our panelists

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,080
so

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,159

assistant professor of computer science

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,000
here at purdue and insecuring a

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,240
professor of astro and aero engineering

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,840
at purdue

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,400
and our moderator for this panel is a

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,079
professor dan hurleman who's the

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,079
executive director of international

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,920
advancement and a professor of

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,479
mechanical engineering dan

50
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,920
it's yours thank you

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,320
thank you joel and it's great to to be

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,320
with you all today thanks for joining us

53
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,600
a great

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,360
couple of presentations earlier and

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,960
thrilled to be involved in the first

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,159
panel

57
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,640
as joel said we have a great group of

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,320
panelists

59
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,280
but our topic is aerocyber

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,720
aerospace

61
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,800
aeronautics aviation

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,640
and embedded systems and the resource

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,239
constraints thereof and certainly

64
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,920
all mobile systems i think have embedded

65
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,080
attributes and that ends up with

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,560
resource constraints on energy

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,480
on memory

68
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,599
power

69
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,239
all those things and so

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,080
and that's a challenge because our

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,239
threats our cyber threats are often

72
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,640
working in unconstrained domains with

73
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
very large resources to go after us

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,720
especially nation states

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,560
and so that translates to significant

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,720
challenges for designers

77
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,959
and operators of of these systems so

78
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,280
that's generally the topic uh for

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,480
today's

80
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,360
panel

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,680
very briefly there is a an organization

82
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,360
a new one that's just stood up that's

83
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,760
related to this area uh it's called it's

84
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,480
a space ice act space information

85
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,720
sharing and assurance center

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
it's been going for about a year

87
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,560
purdue's a founding board member and

88
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
several of the

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,560
serious members on the founding board

90
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,280
are northrop and lockheed

91
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,360
microsoft boeing's on the board i

92
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,720
remember

93
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,200
raytheon applied physics lab

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,720
and there's only two universities purdue

95
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,879
being one on the founding board and that

96
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,760
group

97
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,000
works in this area kind of an industry

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,280
centered

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,760
activity whereas sirius here at purdue

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,360
is more of an academic centered activity

101
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,640
there's a couple of working groups in

102
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,519
that

103
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,920
i co-chair one on our research and

104
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,920
technology for

105
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,519
cyber physical security and space

106
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,000
systems and one on workforce

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,400
and so i snuck in a couple questions to

108
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
ask our panelists about those two things

109
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,239
so if you're interested in that

110
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,799
that organization google space isac or

111
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,280
email me or chat me and we'll

112
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,480
talk about it

113
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,560
but before i introduce the panel

114
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,439
uh let's uh

115
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,799
the format for today we have an hour

116
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,879
my five minutes is about up so we'll get

117
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,959
down to business here in just a minute

118
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,279
uh we're asking all of the panelists to

119
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,040
give us a sort of a position statement

120
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,720
two or three minutes

121
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,120
share their perspective and position on

122
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,360
this the challenges of resource

123
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,880
constrained

124
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,479
embedded systems for

125
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,759
mobile aero and space systems

126
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,560
um

127
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
after that uh

128
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,520
i've

129
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,199
shared a set of questions with them that

130
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,120
we'll try to go through maybe informed

131
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,440
by some of their points of view and

132
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,919
that'll go for 20 or 30 minutes

133
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,639
and then the last 10 or 20 will have a

134
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,040
chance to

135
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,960
take audience questions and i assume

136
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,680
joel and i will somehow

137
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,479
co-handle that and get to your questions

138
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,080
as well

139
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,160
so with that let's start through our

140
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,320
group and again thank joel thanks for

141
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,479
introducing this this uh

142
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,759
this group so john uh boeing i'll turn

143
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,560
it over to you and for your uh

144
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
introductory remarks

145
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,240
all right thank you very much can you

146
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,320
hear me

147
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,280
okay

148
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,960
awesome so

149
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,479
i'm john bush

150
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,680
i've been in boeing commercial airplanes

151
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,400
for

152
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,240
30 plus years

153
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,759
and i've been in cyber security for 10.

154
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,680
so we've been

155
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,800
working along just like damn was saying

156
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,720
we actually founded

157
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,600
five years ago an aviation ice sac that

158
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,160
got put together to concentrate on the

159
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,000
aviation piece

160
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,240
of the information sharing and now you

161
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,680
know with

162
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,960
with space

163
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,639
the thing about

164
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,880
really in aviation

165
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,800
cyber

166
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,520
is just an attribute you know like they

167
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,160
were saying cyber plus arrow it's really

168
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,479
the other way around it is

169
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,280
functions and then cyber we're using

170
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,880
this technology

171
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,360
to effectively um

172
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,759
do the functions that we want to do so

173
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,240
the emphasis is very different you know

174
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,960
it

175
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,360
you know it's an afterthought 10 years

176
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,120
ago was like we don't want to know about

177
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,840
cyber you know lots of hacks have

178
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,440
happened people have got their credit

179
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,680
cards now the question is what are our

180
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
cyber requirements

181
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,520
and it's very different in the aviation

182
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,000
world because

183
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,039
at boeing and an oem we work at a very

184
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,919
airplane level set of requirements

185
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,039
but cyber is down at the implementation

186
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,600
and so you have people using the same

187
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
language but they talk a lot so a lot of

188
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,800
it is about awareness trying to get

189
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,440
people to understand and stuff

190
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,000
the other thing about aviation is like

191
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,240
when the ground communicates to the

192
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,520
airplane

193
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
it's via voice

194
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,919
there you know there is some digital

195
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,160
communication but

196
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,319
nothing about encryption nothing about

197
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,280
message authentication or any that and

198
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,039
these things have been around you know

199
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,440
voice since the 40s

200
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,160
uh digital communication since the 80s

201
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,639
now we've got adsb there was just a

202
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,720
mandate on that there's no encryption in

203
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
that signal there's no authentication in

204
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,400
that signal and it's

205
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,880
just been mandated so cyber is really

206
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,840
an attribute that is growing in aviation

207
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,000
and has to be there

208
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,800
but

209
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,440
you know it um

210
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,319
it's gonna be you know we're still at

211
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,960
understanding the big context

212
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,000
you know down to the details of doing

213
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
that and so it's it's a very interesting

214
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,720
area you know i'm glad we're having this

215
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,960
seven this panel to talk about it

216
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,680
because i think it's gonna be very good

217
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,120
uh back to you

218
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,879
thanks so much john and now i'll turn it

219
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,319
over to dr jelick

220
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,360
from purdue as well

221
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,280
hi everyone uh thanks for being here i'm

222
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,759
bertie selig i'm an assistant professor

223
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,759
in the department of computer science at

224
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,160
purdue university

225
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,800
so mainly uh my research investigates

226
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,840
the design and evaluation of security

227
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,199
for software and systems specifically i

228
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,759
focus on emerging competing platforms

229
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,840
and the complex environments

230
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,958
in which they operate

231
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,320
so my research approach is basically

232
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,880
best illustrated by the my work in

233
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,799
safety and security of internet of

234
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,839
things and cyber physical systems

235
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,080
also in robotic vehicles and automotives

236
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,560
uh so i'm very glad to be here we have a

237
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,600
couple of projects going on

238
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,080
what i see is uh recently

239
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,399
the aerospace industry have well

240
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,880
recognized that they need they need to

241
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,480
move faster

242
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,600
towards the digital feature

243
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,320
so this means that the companies adapt

244
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,160
technologies by using different sensors

245
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,800
and

246
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,080
actuators from different manufacturers

247
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,920
and also they integrate some edge

248
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,600
competing or cloud computing

249
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,640
technologies which drives the efficiency

250
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,880
and correctness of their products and

251
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,480
services

252
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,839
however during this process

253
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,720
these developers or the system designers

254
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,360
needs to understand the system in detail

255
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,600
as well as they need to have some

256
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,480
set of security skills in order to

257
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,800
make the trust and their track models

258
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,240
very accurate

259
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,320
so that they can understand the trade

260
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,240
space of their

261
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,040
products and developed

262
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,080
some efficient techniques against them

263
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,880
however this is challenging because

264
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,279
these systems are oftentimes very

265
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,399
complex

266
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,279
and

267
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,440
on the other side uh the people who are

268
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,839
designing this mostly focusing on their

269
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,720
efficiency maybe they are eliminating

270
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,760
the some designs perspective that would

271
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,279
make these systems

272
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,040
safe and secure

273
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,800
so i see that there is a gap here

274
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,200
additionally what i see is because these

275
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,760
systems integrate multiple different

276
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,120
components which are able to work in

277
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,480
both digital and physical domains this

278
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,800
also introduces new attack factors to

279
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,920
the adversaries and new challenges that

280
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,079
we should consider in order to create

281
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,359
efficient defenses

282
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,200
great thank you thank you so much

283
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,519
our next uh panelist is

284
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,760
michael gahn he's a mechanical engineer

285
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,920
which proves emmys can do anything i

286
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,120
think

287
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,920
um fellow mechanical engineer and uh but

288
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,680
also he's really the executive sponsor

289
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,959
for our purdue rolls-royce phd cyber

290
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,360
fellows program and and the consortium

291
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,160
so

292
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,880
thanks for all you do there mike uh and

293
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,560
turn it over to you

294
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,720
oh uh thank you dan and thank you on

295
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,320
behalf of rolls royce to be on this

296
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,440
panel today on this important topic so

297
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,839
when you think of rolls-royce i i'd like

298
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,000
you to first think of power and

299
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,720
propulsion systems such as jet engines

300
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
and not as cars

301
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,399
even though we share the same name and

302
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,600
logo so

303
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,240
i just set the stage there

304
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,640
our customers on the defense side with

305
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,480
the department of defense in the u.s and

306
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
the mod in the uk

307
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,519
and civil uh within faa and yasa are

308
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,079
fortunately increasing our cyber

309
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,880
security is as important as

310
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,279
as john recently kind of

311
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,240
mentioned

312
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,800
and our latest announcement on the b-52

313
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,360
win on the commercial engine

314
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,760
replacement program

315
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,600
there was a threshold requirement on

316
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
cyber security that that you needed to

317
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,360
meet even to be considered as a

318
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,519
competitor on that program

319
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,279
so

320
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,600
it is absolutely an attribute that's

321
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,720
growing within aviation and aerospace so

322
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,000
um

323
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,320
so i'd like to uh just mention a little

324
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,920
bit about myself so i've been at

325
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,160
rolls-royce 14 years and as dan

326
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,000
mentioned i am a

327
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,360
mechanical engineering and aero engineer

328
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,519
by trade and i've only been in cyber

329
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,760
here for a few years um but prior to

330
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,519
that i was with the u.s air force in the

331
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,120
u.s navy so

332
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,320
um

333
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,399
and and it's uh i'm it's great to be

334
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,839
here talking about this

335
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,680
subject today um because our

336
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,440
collaborations with universities and

337
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,600
governments are what are going to or

338
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,360
what's really going to enable us to move

339
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,079
forward and secure the aviation space

340
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,560
great thanks thanks mike and

341
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,599
now professor wong

342
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,000
hi um i am enzo quang in the school of

343
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,959
aeronautics and astronautics and my

344
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,480
research area is autonomy and controls

345
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,399
and especially focused on the higher

346
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,760
insurance autonomy for cyber physical

347
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,839
systems with the application to i mean

348
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,600
the other department so the aerospace

349
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,040
applications

350
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,240
and my focus is on the cyber physical

351
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,279
systems and our traditional systems are

352
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,600
typically physical systems but nowadays

353
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,920
due to the rapid advancement in

354
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,240
computing sensing communication

355
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,839
technologies

356
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,120
our

357
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,440
used to be dumb system becoming ever

358
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,040
more intelligent

359
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,519
and to be intelligent they are relying

360
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,839
on sensors on both sensors and

361
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,440
communications

362
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,320
and this opens up the door for

363
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,800
the new challenges in the area of cyber

364
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,760
security as john just mentioned he's in

365
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,880
the air department so in aero industry

366
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,199
so the airplane traditionally we don't

367
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,199
care about cyber security i never heard

368
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,279
about cyber security when i was graduate

369
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,079
students for example but now the cyber

370
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,839
security getting more important in this

371
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,279
area because

372
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,760
just like iot airplanes gets connected

373
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,560
to other airplanes and also new types of

374
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,639
airplanes now and will be operating

375
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,600
thing soon such as the unmanned aircraft

376
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,079
system say for say drones

377
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,600
or the uh air taxi that we call the uam

378
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,839
urban air mobilities and personal area

379
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,600
vehicles and all sorts of different

380
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,120
these vehicles

381
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,600
and highly rely on autonomy and this

382
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,519
autonomy again as it says that relying

383
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,519
on on-board sensors and communicating

384
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,880
information

385
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,199
from the ground control station or from

386
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,000
the other vehicles surrounded in the

387
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,360
neighbor

388
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,320
so

389
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,399
the different from traditional cyber

390
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,199
systems where the computer science

391
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,839
the scientists work on a lot and the

392
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,440
information security for example

393
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,480
encryptions authentications all these

394
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,560
and in these cyberphysical systems if

395
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,959
you lose security or breach it is a part

396
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,399
of the security

397
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,000
uh then

398
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,800
not only we lost uh we lose the

399
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,839
information and more importantly

400
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,800
we can suffer from the property damages

401
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,040
and even human losses because airplane

402
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,880
can crash want to hit the other

403
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,120
airplanes or hit the building just like

404
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,560
911.

405
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,600
so the if you consider the how

406
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,279
dangerous

407
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,759
the system could be if serious cyber

408
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,839
attack happens breached into the our

409
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,320
autopilot systems

410
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,480
the our systems again this is also

411
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,839
applicable to

412
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,720
ground system too the intelligent cars

413
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,680
and then

414
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,600
and there are many

415
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
accidents incidents and you know

416
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,320
simulated incidents that hackers can

417
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,279
crack into the uh automobiles control

418
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,800
systems and you know stop the car and

419
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,880
accelerate the car hit the buildings and

420
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,040
all sorts of things can be possible but

421
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,199
unfortunately so far

422
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,000
the

423
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,639
cyber security never ever been seriously

424
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,040
considered so the uh the communication

425
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,480
channel for example

426
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,519
the uavs and the urban air mobilities

427
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,680
even the commercial airlines

428
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,360
they use the narrow only voice

429
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,120
communication channel growth data link

430
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,519
he mentioned the john mentioned the adsb

431
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,959
is not encrypted at all and also drones

432
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,800
using the

433
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,600
the specialized communication protocol

434
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,160
or link and bevel link is not

435
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,720
encrypted at all either

436
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,519
so

437
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,000
the again this opens up the doors and

438
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,680
then since i'm in the

439
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,160
autonomy area and controls area

440
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,480
different from the traditional cyber

441
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,320
security again such as encryption

442
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,360
authentications my interest or interest

443
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,680
in this autonomy domain is that can we

444
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,920
design an autonomous system for

445
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,519
including the

446
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,600
uh health monitoring system of the

447
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,680
physical system and the autonomy

448
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,480
controllers even mother-based one or

449
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,600
nowadays ai-based ones can it design

450
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,240
such algorithm can still operating

451
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,280
within the allowable range under cyber

452
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,240
attack if there is a cyber attack system

453
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,559
is vulnerable can it tell

454
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,199
by analyzing the system even before they

455
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,640
are implemented

456
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,359
and then the next step is that if cyber

457
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,959
attack is feasible

458
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,160
can we

459
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,240
how severe certain type of cyber attack

460
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,640
will be it can crash the airplane it

461
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,160
just slightly perturb this attitude i

462
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,960
mean severity widely varies

463
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,480
at the same time

464
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,960
then the if attack is possible can it

465
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,000
detect it some attacks are well designed

466
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,320
in a sophisticatedly designed such that

467
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,240
you can bypass the monitoring system we

468
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,640
call such attack as a stealthy attack

469
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,640
and third attack can be designed

470
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,480
possibly designed by placing a game

471
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,919
monitoring system

472
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,480
and so if so can we design the

473
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,400
monitoring system more sophisticated

474
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,440
country

475
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,520
and also eventually that can it design

476
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,000
cybertech resilient autonomy control

477
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,160
algorithm such a way that even if there

478
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,559
is a cyber attack system operate more or

479
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,720
less safely even though the performance

480
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,520
may be degraded but still

481
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,760
they operate and then safely you know

482
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,080
land and that sort of thing will be very

483
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,559
important and that's what is my research

484
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,280
area thank you

485
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,640
thank you

486
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,559
uh so now we're going to a set of

487
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,120
questions i'll try to help balance it uh

488
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,880
the first one's uh

489
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,720
i know we're all running as fast as we

490
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,320
can to stay even

491
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,480
uh but if you took out a crystal ball

492
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,320
and kind of looked ahead

493
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,919
what do you see coming in the next

494
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,480
handful of years few years in terms of

495
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,720
trends are going to change

496
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,559
in some way the job that you're trying

497
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,919
to do so

498
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,840
let me start with john and

499
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,880
mike

500
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,960
from the industry's perspective of what

501
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,600
trends do you see that's changing the

502
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,080
job you're having to do

503
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,960
so

504
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,919
a lot of what's changing is just the

505
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,440
awareness of cyber security

506
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,200
and the regulators and the operators the

507
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,039
environment that we work in

508
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,000
is becoming much more aware that we

509
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,600
cyber is

510
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,720
a

511
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,880
a major threat issue

512
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,000
and the fact that we have been

513
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,600
transitioning

514
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,200
our data more the airplane systems to

515
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
commercial off-the-shelf airplane

516
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,440
systems when i started as a young

517
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,280
engineer we had these things called

518
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,000
errant buses and they were aviation

519
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,960
specific just made for aviation

520
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,000
now we are using ethernet and ethernet

521
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,039
based

522
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,799
things that

523
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,559
you know are are where all the

524
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,960
vulnerabilities are and using operating

525
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
systems that uh

526
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,360
are based on you know commercial

527
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,520
operating systems versus very unique

528
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,000
ones that we used to use and so there's

529
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,080
just gonna the the threat surface is

530
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,679
just getting much larger and

531
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,480
and

532
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,039
more functionality so i think that's the

533
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,120
big trend is that it's it's just going

534
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,320
to be more impactful but what is really

535
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,000
important is to really understand the

536
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,520
context like professor is talking about

537
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,000
attacking the control services we have

538
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,559
so many layers of defense

539
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,600
that

540
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,159
that would be very very difficult on a

541
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,039
big commercial airplane on a small drone

542
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,840
in some of the urban air mobiles maybe

543
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,679
not you know there's

544
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,679
and that's kind of an area you know

545
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,360
where there's going to be all these new

546
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,120
entrants that are going to want to use

547
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,200
commercial off the shelf and that

548
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,600
and we have to be really

549
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,959
diligent in our cyber

550
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,919
work to make sure that those those

551
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,080
things stay safe so the whole air space

552
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,600
is safe because we all share the air

553
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,880
space there's only one air space so

554
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,039
it's gonna be you know it's gonna be a

555
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,159
challenge and good

556
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,400
indeed hey thanks john and my first

557
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
internship was with boeing working on it

558
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,000
database in fortran so i go back a ways

559
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,240
with you

560
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,320
yeah

561
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,200
who did you say dan

562
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,799
um

563
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,760
okay

564
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,559
um so from our perspective there's uh

565
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,280
two different engineering uh mindsets

566
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,039
and skill sets that are converging and

567
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,039
this was hinted at by one of the

568
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,480
professors here

569
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,280
one is safety which is deliberate in its

570
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,559
pace and cyber which needs to move

571
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,240
move fast to keep pace with the

572
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,360
attackers

573
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,919
um so there's no easy solution of how we

574
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,200
handle this

575
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,000
uh

576
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,840
the differences arise not only from

577
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,520
engineering teams that develop and

578
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,760
design but that has to continue through

579
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,159
the verification validation

580
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,240
uh testing and evaluation through

581
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,120
in-service operation however we need

582
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,000
both not just one or the other

583
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,799
and i'd also like to point out that

584
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,280
in aero we have

585
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,559
very large lifespans in our products so

586
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,640
common consumer electronics and iet

587
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,880
equipment are expected to have

588
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
be supported for five to five years

589
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,080
maybe ten

590
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,760
our products are expected to continue

591
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,720
flying for 20 plus years and even longer

592
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,120
on the defense systems uh sometimes up

593
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,720
to 50 years

594
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
so what technologies threats and

595
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,640
capabilities and strategies will be

596
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,400
present then

597
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,679
and then uh

598
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,720
one positive trend that we have is that

599
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,280
increased focus that john mentioned uh

600
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,520
from our customers in the industry

601
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,840
coupled by our ability to make very

602
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,280
bespoke systems so

603
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,360
i'll end with that

604
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,919
great thank you thank you um i want to

605
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,240
move on we'll we'll have the faculty

606
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,840
take on the second question for us and

607
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,679
then of course if john or mike if you

608
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,520
want to jump in this is about knowledge

609
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,120
gaps

610
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,520
what what's hindering us from doing as

611
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,919
much as we need to do today and in the

612
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,120
future on

613
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,280
uh assuring uh these space cyber

614
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,240
global

615
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,400
transportation cyber systems

616
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
and what's the are the sort of the

617
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,600
research and technology needs that can

618
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
help fill those gaps uh let's start with

619
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,880
uh you professor chilling

620
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,600
yes so sure this is a um

621
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,760
great question so the gaps right the

622
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,280
knowledge gaps

623
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,120
so what i see is

624
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,840
in order to secure a system

625
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,080
we need to first understand how that

626
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,400
system operates right and we need to do

627
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,320
this in detail

628
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,480
at both the system level and also the

629
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,400
application levels

630
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,360
thereafter we need to conduct threat and

631
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,080
trust model assessment by asking a set

632
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,520
of questions

633
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,760
so these questions might be

634
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,520
like what are the assets that we are

635
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,080
trying to protect right what kind of

636
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,440
threats um that might be this system uh

637
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,480
face

638
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,200
or can we envision any feasible attack

639
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,600
that would violate any our security

640
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
goals

641
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,279
so mainly the answer of these questions

642
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,200
is called a chat model

643
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,600
a characterization of threats that the

644
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,919
system must deal with right

645
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,279
this will

646
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,279
after we define the threat model this

647
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,880
will enable us

648
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,559
to identify fundamentally new algorithms

649
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,200
techniques and tools to design

650
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,520
and build and operate these techniques

651
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,559
in order to have secure systems and

652
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,679
protect our critical infrastructure

653
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,200
however

654
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
there is a gap between understanding

655
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,799
these systems

656
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,679
and

657
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,640
also the training and education of the

658
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,679
individuals about the security

659
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,400
of these systems so that they can ask

660
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,799
the right questions right

661
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,720
so without without having this

662
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,320
understanding

663
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,799
we are missing some threat models

664
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,400
or we are missing some parts of the

665
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,320
threat model that

666
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,919
kind of uh prevents us from developing

667
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,240
efficient techniques

668
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,360
especially i see this gap in aviation

669
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,480
because

670
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,200
maybe the institutions or students do

671
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,799
not have access to this type of

672
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,120
like the real operating devices or their

673
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,880
test pads or their simulations at all

674
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,600
right

675
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,240
thank you so

676
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,520
okay thank you

677
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,480
could you uh weigh in as well

678
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,440
yeah i i agree what the

679
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,919
berkey said and on top of it i want to

680
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,279
say that

681
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,120
cyber security as i mentioned the

682
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,200
psychophysical system cyber domain

683
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,279
traditionally computer science

684
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,320
the area and then the physical systems

685
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,559
aero mechanical you know

686
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,919
domain so multithis plenary effort is

687
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,880
the uh the gap we even though

688
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,520
some of the problems are very

689
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,080
recognized by both communities their

690
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,640
language is quite different and turns

691
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,400
out to be that we are talking about the

692
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
same thing but we could not understand

693
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,960
the others ideas and concepts because of

694
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,279
these language differences

695
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,200
and then the awareness as john mentioned

696
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,440
that the now the awareness growing in

697
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,200
this autonomy group

698
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,640
and so that the uh the our students get

699
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,919
more used to

700
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,480
or exposed to

701
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,760
the computer science concepts and ideas

702
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,240
and how the system is operating as well

703
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,320
as our traditional domain of the

704
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,159
physical systems you know dynamics

705
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,640
differentiations and so on but many

706
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,520
times students lacking that all the

707
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,480
different conceptual model is used and

708
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,559
concepts use the different mathematical

709
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,640
tools used in the computer science so

710
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,360
bridging the gap is the uh typically

711
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,760
what i have encountered by interacting

712
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,080
with the uh industry you know the

713
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,960
national the agencies people

714
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,440
and then the uh our students

715
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,320
so the interdisciplinary organization

716
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,240
these plenary aspects

717
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,960
i think is nowadays the gaps that we

718
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,600
have to feed

719
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,080
thank you uh now mike and john let me

720
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,000
say if you had

721
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,640
one silver bullet to fire at a gap

722
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,039
somewhere in the technology

723
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,320
domain that you deal with what would you

724
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,799
fire it at

725
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,039
so i don't think there is one silver

726
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,559
bullet and

727
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,159
10 years ago

728
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,000
that is what all the managers were

729
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,080
asking and that's what industry was

730
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,120
asking what is the one silver bullet

731
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,559
and

732
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,039
cyber is a is an onion and there are

733
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,559
different layers and different pieces so

734
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,760
um

735
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,720
you know

736
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,320
we

737
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
the one thing i wanted to say to you and

738
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,240
all the students is

739
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,279
cyber's still so new in aviation and

740
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,399
stuff

741
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,360
anyone here that's taken a cyber class

742
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,520
has more formal in

743
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,399
more formal education than i do

744
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,200
i have never had a formal cyber security

745
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,799
class and a lot of people in in aviation

746
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,240
don't have that

747
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,559
so this is a great place to come in and

748
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,120
take that knowledge even if it's just

749
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,360
and really understand the context and

750
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,679
understand because we deal from anything

751
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,600
from supply chain

752
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,720
chip vulnerabilities up to big systems

753
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,279
talking you know systems and systems

754
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,200
and all the things we have all these

755
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,360
different layers and it's really hard to

756
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,679
say one thing i think awareness is

757
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,360
really okay you know it's not a

758
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
technology but it's really something

759
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,000
that's important that i think everyone

760
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,600
still has to

761
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,760
has to be able to figure out

762
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,440
all right mike you get a silver bullet

763
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,640
we don't know where we get it from but

764
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,520
what are you fired at

765
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,760
i i i'd like to echo a lot of the things

766
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,559
that john mentioned um you know aero

767
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,640
cyber embedded systems are

768
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,679
are not like it systems and

769
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,760
we usually have bespoke processors and

770
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,919
modules do the environmental constraints

771
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,480
that these things fly in

772
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,840
and they're much more resource

773
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,000
constrained so a lot of the common

774
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,159
security approaches that

775
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,679
that are out there they need to be

776
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,159
developed adapted and integrated into

777
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,679
our systems there's nothing that's

778
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,520
really bolt on so

779
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,039
um and i i will absolutely second the

780
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,919
lack of any kind of cyber uh formal

781
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,120
education

782
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,200
um and uh

783
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,679
because uh a few people on our team do

784
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,120
have that but not many um and uh and so

785
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,279
there's there's a lot of unique r t

786
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,919
needs and it covers the whole gamut of

787
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,520
the nist um

788
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,159
uh cyber security framework from protect

789
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,080
detect or identify react and recover

790
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,760
and uh and i think the the key thing i

791
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,240
i'd like to uh stress is

792
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,320
uh because it's so new

793
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,760
um and and uh you really need to have

794
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,919
the people that we're looking for need

795
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,919
to be good communicators have good

796
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,000
emotional intelligence because a lot of

797
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,080
times it's as much of an influence

798
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,360
campaign

799
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,159
across all the different disciplines

800
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,399
that that go into building that system

801
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,640
such as the supply chain or the

802
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,600
different uh components of the aircraft

803
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,039
uh in products um and and having those

804
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,880
goods uh eq skills and good

805
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,279
good communication skills is very very

806
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,200
helpful

807
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,559
okay thank you

808
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,080
all right i'll switch to either i'd like

809
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,039
to

810
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,440
i like the eq skills i think is

811
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,080
extremely important because we are a

812
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,480
cost

813
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,880
that's a resource limited thing and so

814
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,559
if you're doing cyber you're not going

815
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,640
to do some functionality

816
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,760
and so your job as a cyber person is to

817
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,720
basically say no you can't do that you

818
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,240
have to do this

819
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,519
so eq is really important i it's a thing

820
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,440
i wish i would have known 30 years ago

821
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,279
in school because i would have taken

822
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,600
more classes on that because

823
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,559
that especially with cyber in aviation

824
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,240
it's really about emotional intelligence

825
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,720
that is really important and being able

826
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,760
to

827
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,720
talk with everyone and understand what's

828
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,360
going on and being able to influence

829
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,320
people just by talking is really key

830
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,039
great

831
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,600
okay the next question is about uh the

832
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,799
asymmetry between the threat actors

833
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,200
and our embedded systems and and the

834
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,840
teams of people working on them so

835
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,120
how do you see i mean you're surmounting

836
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,000
that

837
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,919
challenge these days but it's only going

838
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,279
to get worse how do you think about that

839
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,760
asymmetry how fast the threats are

840
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,320
moving how fast can we move

841
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,399
and i'll just open it up if you uh want

842
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,799
to jump in on this just

843
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,440
wave or start talking uh and

844
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,640
uh

845
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,480
take an opportunity to

846
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,880
add to this

847
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,760
i'll wait to get it going um

848
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,320
i think one of the things at least in

849
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,039
aviation and around airplanes and how

850
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,440
airplane systems are put together is

851
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,200
that we really limit the threat surface

852
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,360
so there are very few

853
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,159
entry points for people to get into the

854
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,279
system

855
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,039
so even though

856
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,559
the hackers are going much

857
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,559
faster with

858
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,519
unlimited resources and that they have

859
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,279
very little ways to get into the system

860
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,120
so it's so

861
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,440
that's one of the things but

862
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,360
just like we found you know when we

863
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,000
built the 787 it was

864
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,519
inspect in 2004

865
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:18,480
2005

866
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,360
it had like shaw one hashes

867
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,480
now

868
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,960
you know in the 20 20 20 that is not

869
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,120
acceptable anymore and so it has to

870
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,080
change so we do have that you know

871
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
legacy thing that

872
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,679
um

873
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,840
airplanes will need to learn to change

874
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840
much faster but we have a slow

875
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,880
deliberate safety process that has

876
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,799
proven and driven out

877
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,559
accidents over the last 50 years so we

878
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,760
need to continue doing that you know and

879
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,000
be very diligent and how we split that

880
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,519
up so that

881
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,519
because that hackers are getting much

882
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,840
faster and better and stuff so we have

883
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,799
to limit our threat surface and be very

884
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,120
cautious and deliberate about what we

885
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,440
allow it to happen because you don't log

886
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,679
into an airplane

887
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,359
to fly it

888
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,079
now you will with utms and so that's

889
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,359
going to be a different thing you know

890
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,119
there there's a whole new market where

891
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,280
that's going to happen but right now on

892
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,440
when you go to the airport your pilots

893
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,599
aren't logging in so we do have that

894
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,960
safety built in and so that's sort of a

895
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,040
the embeddedness

896
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,719
turns into an advantage from that point

897
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,560
of view you naturally have a smaller

898
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,679
threat surface so i guess that's a plus

899
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,079
an upside thanks that was a good one

900
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,159
anyone else want to talk about the

901
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,040
asymmetry and its trend and how we

902
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,280
battle it um so i would like to add a

903
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,960
couple of things here

904
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,399
even though uh

905
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,960
like as it is said uh the trek threat

906
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,560
surface might be

907
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,320
um like smaller than the other

908
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,639
traditional competing platforms but what

909
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,400
i would say is

910
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,480
uh there are like many different threat

911
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,680
actors

912
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,599
but i guess particularly in aviation

913
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,520
these threat actors might be the part of

914
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,920
the advanced persistent threat groups

915
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,079
which are very sophisticated well-funded

916
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,800
and strategic groups right

917
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,280
in that sense i guess uh

918
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,359
so we should not underestimate

919
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,000
the the the attack surfaces

920
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
um by just saying that you know it's

921
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,320
difficult uh because uh we we are

922
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,760
recently seeing that

923
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,119
uh these uh apt groups uh advanced

924
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,280
persistent chat groups can able to

925
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,320
attack uh the water treatment plants or

926
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,359
the power plants etc after like

927
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,280
uh working uh many many many years uh or

928
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,480
um

929
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,800
even applying some uh psychological

930
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,440
attacks to some workers uh in order to

931
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,680
you know like use them as a stepping

932
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,560
stone

933
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,119
uh to go inside and

934
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,839
the companies or their software systems

935
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,560
great thanks

936
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,000
any other thoughts on that

937
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,200
question

938
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
i think one of the you know when i think

939
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,400
about

940
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,040
what can we do to help uh help with that

941
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,400
is we have to be agile and able to adapt

942
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,520
and this is not just from technologies

943
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,119
or methods

944
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,440
uh or designs and software sort of

945
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,760
perspective but also from a team's

946
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,119
perspective

947
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,560
and in our thinking as well uh so

948
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,000
you know the systems we ship are

949
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,160
resource constrained but you know the

950
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
whole of our business is not

951
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,480
um if we limit our view of security to

952
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,720
those things that are

953
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,880
in our products alone i think we might

954
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,359
be unnecessarily limiting ourselves in

955
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,480
ways that our attackers aren't

956
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,440
that's interesting yeah

957
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,960
and for me uh the aviation domain also

958
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,440
grow very rapidly by incorporating

959
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,359
varieties

960
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,839
of different types of vehicles including

961
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:02,960
drones

962
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,560
and so to accommodate this many drone

963
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,480
operations safely especially urban

964
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,680
environment

965
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,160
the concept called the utm uas traffic

966
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,560
management system is proposed similar to

967
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,000
atm education systems but this is more

968
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,320
rely on the

969
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,800
the technology than human

970
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,520
so different from the uh traditional

971
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,560
commercial airlines their systems are

972
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,040
the data link connected

973
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,760
and also the registrations or you know

974
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,040
data driven and so on so that it is more

975
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,280
vulnerable to cyber attack than the

976
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,160
traditional uh the aviation domain so

977
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,640
that's a growing effort so the one of my

978
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,280
projects sponsored by nasa

979
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,720
is the how we design a utm system in

980
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,359
such a way that it is not only safe

981
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,040
as safe as the atm system but also is

982
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,800
secure

983
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,880
so that the uh

984
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,960
safety level can be maintained just like

985
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,560
our traditional legacy very safe

986
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,359
aviation system

987
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,680
great thank you

988
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,400
um like to it was brought up a bit

989
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,160
earlier in a couple but i'd like to then

990
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,480
go to kind of the workforce education

991
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,079
and training

992
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,640
what uh what changes you know some

993
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,480
things have happened over the 30 or plus

994
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,599
years that

995
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,920
some of us have been out but

996
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,680
what are your recommendations on

997
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,040
workforce

998
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
development in

999
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,440
how the universities is one element of

1000
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,119
this but of course continuing education

1001
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,359
and others

1002
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,960
what are your recommendations on

1003
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,839
workforce going forward

1004
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,160
so um i think i think one of the key

1005
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,079
things um and it's been mentioned a

1006
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,320
couple times already is we need a cyber

1007
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,560
informed workforce

1008
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
and so it's not just people with cyber

1009
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,599
and a job title but it's software

1010
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,320
engineers electronic engineers soft

1011
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,280
systems engineers and program managers

1012
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,440
and business people

1013
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,520
we need to reach outside of our typical

1014
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,160
cyber majors and help and help other

1015
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,480
skill sets see how they contribute to

1016
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
producing

1017
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,280
secure systems

1018
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,079
um and i i think from a you know this is

1019
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,280
really akin to the cross-functional and

1020
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,280
cross-disciplinary nature of sirius you

1021
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,839
know that you guys pioneered and uh

1022
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,680
insecurity here

1023
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,280
we also need to continue the

1024
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,040
collaboration between industry and

1025
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,480
academia

1026
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,680
and

1027
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,359
this not only helps solve the hard

1028
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,400
problems

1029
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,720
but it it helps it introduces students

1030
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,119
to the types of problems that industry

1031
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,240
faces

1032
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,480
and gives them uh practical experience

1033
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,560
while developing a talent pipeline so i

1034
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,280
think that that hands-on

1035
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,480
work is will be very critical especially

1036
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,200
in this near term as we try to

1037
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,200
staff up to address this problem

1038
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,599
john any comments from the boeing

1039
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,280
perspective or like your perspective

1040
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,720
yeah so

1041
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,440
we've been hiring people left and right

1042
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,839
and so we've just you know we've been

1043
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,760
talking about what kind of training do

1044
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,319
people need and where do we need

1045
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,440
with

1046
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,720
us a lot of it is understanding our

1047
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,599
aviation context and how

1048
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,400
aviation regulations and stuff again

1049
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,599
we're using the computer technology to

1050
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,319
do functions to fly airplanes to

1051
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,040
communicate we're not using it for users

1052
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,880
to log in and

1053
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,800
surf the web and stuff

1054
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,680
so

1055
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,880
it's an embedded system and so

1056
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,119
even though yeah you have authentication

1057
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,040
and authorization it's used very

1058
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,760
differently and being having

1059
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,480
you know it's really systems engineering

1060
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,599
is really a big thing so having

1061
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,760
understanding the whole systems of

1062
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,720
systems and very complex

1063
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,359
and being able to describe it in detail

1064
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,359
is really important

1065
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,319
you know

1066
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:13,119
the

1067
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,880
you know the cyber piece and

1068
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,640
understanding that i mean that gives

1069
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,280
such a great foundation for people for

1070
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,319
system engineering and stuff but again

1071
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,480
being able to look at other people's

1072
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,640
perspective is really clear because you

1073
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,800
have to influence people and you have to

1074
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,400
understand what they're doing because

1075
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,000
they won't have

1076
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,440
you know you go talk to some of the

1077
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,319
works tcas or in-flight entertainment

1078
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,560
they have no idea they understand oh

1079
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,640
yeah it's network together there's an ip

1080
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,960
address but they have no idea what that

1081
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,720
really is going to mean from a cyber

1082
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,119
standpoint and people that have the

1083
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,960
knowledge you have to explain that to

1084
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,280
them so really be learning to be a

1085
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,240
teacher and explain these hard concepts

1086
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,520
to people

1087
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,760
is really kind of a key

1088
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,079
a key piece and that's probably not you

1089
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,720
know it's not all the academic classes

1090
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,560
it's the part of being a a full engineer

1091
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,240
you know and a total person that's

1092
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,640
really kind of key

1093
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,680
thank you

1094
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,839
insult you've been uh leading

1095
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:20,079
in well i say adding a cyber informed

1096
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,319
mindset in aerospace engineering for

1097
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:23,839
example what

1098
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,200
how's that going and what are your

1099
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,680
thoughts on going forward on

1100
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,040
changing our education

1101
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,640
so uh the

1102
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,119
still struggling in the sense that the

1103
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,359
our students say for example the

1104
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,960
students are

1105
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,200
i mean is this really aero engineering

1106
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,119
stuff right this is computer science

1107
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,680
stuff and why we have to pay attention

1108
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,440
to this type of one so get them

1109
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,000
motivated it's very important part

1110
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,359
so

1111
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,400
today

1112
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,640
and tomorrow and the day after tomorrow

1113
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,520
we have this special show course that

1114
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,079
mike francis who's retiree from the

1115
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,119
darpa and the lockheed martin and so on

1116
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,359
he is teaching this autonomy

1117
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,319
in the history of autonomy in the aero

1118
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,800
applications that kind of a lecture

1119
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,960
special lectures could be good for

1120
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,200
especially for undergraduate students

1121
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,000
who

1122
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,319
do not have any motivations on this

1123
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,640
autonomy in general specifically cyber

1124
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,079
security and get them exposed to the how

1125
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,280
serious autonomies are and then how

1126
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,640
important autonomy is in aero industry

1127
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,720
along with the cybersecurity and also

1128
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,000
the by nature of this multi-disciplinary

1129
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,119
aspects so students getting some courses

1130
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,240
from say the computer science department

1131
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,960
and stat department and also ece

1132
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,920
department i mean the aae 2 and me too

1133
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,640
so it is opening some of the the class

1134
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,720
requirements open to the other

1135
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,880
department even across the college of

1136
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,200
engineering and college of science would

1137
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,560
also help enhance this uh this cyber

1138
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,599
focused

1139
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,119
uh education

1140
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,520
and so that's what i have found and we

1141
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,200
are trying to

1142
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,560
to uh to achieve you know from the past

1143
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,520
and the next few years so

1144
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,359
okay you come from the computer science

1145
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,160
side and i i know you have

1146
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,520
students from other majors in your

1147
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,720
classes what are your what are your

1148
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,480
perspective on this

1149
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,119
interdisciplinary mindset

1150
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,160
yeah sure it isn't going forward

1151
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,119
um i think uh this is uh extremely

1152
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,800
important topic and

1153
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,440
uh it pays off uh in like five ten years

1154
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,440
right we need to execute something and

1155
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,400
then

1156
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,880
we will see the benefits not immediately

1157
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,400
but later on

1158
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,640
um so there are multiple ways which i

1159
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,720
believe that uh the education and

1160
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,760
wordpress

1161
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,160
of workforce training can that we can

1162
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,920
follow so i would like to give you a

1163
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,680
couple of examples

1164
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,280
uh for instance

1165
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,280
i believe that like both academia and

1166
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,079
industry uh may work with like some uh

1167
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,680
k1 teachers

1168
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,079
right in order to introduce these high

1169
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,800
school students some computer security

1170
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,280
or these emerging team technologies

1171
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,240
maybe this can be integrated uh to their

1172
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,319
curriculums or there can be like some

1173
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,640
corporate visits that you can show

1174
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,200
around and um because these are all

1175
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,920
young generation uh i'm pretty sure that

1176
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,520
there will be like multiple students

1177
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,520
will be influenced uh

1178
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,400
on on these uh the the the content and

1179
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,319
also the visits as well

1180
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,319
uh such an uh computer security literacy

1181
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,119
uh would provide some opportunities uh

1182
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,280
such as they would in the future follow

1183
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,240
some uh stem career pathways right

1184
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,400
um also even though they don't follow

1185
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,800
this at least it will give them an

1186
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,680
awareness of in the context of societal

1187
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,680
implications of security and how these

1188
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,240
systems are used

1189
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,640
secondly like in the university for

1190
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,839
instance we have like a lot of

1191
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,480
theoretical concept that we we teach

1192
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,280
in our classes however like seeing a

1193
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,800
kind of like a real

1194
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,800
real world example or maybe it's just

1195
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,480
like a test patch system

1196
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,160
um or its simulation what i see is

1197
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,640
students really learn fast and when they

1198
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,440
apply the theoretical um

1199
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,440
the topics that we have seen in the

1200
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,520
class to those systems

1201
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,680
uh such as you know like finding a bug

1202
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,880
or making a plant stop working

1203
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,079
um they really enjoy this and they also

1204
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,640
work like teams with teams of groups

1205
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,319
um

1206
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,400
i see that uh

1207
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,720
this will also allow these students to

1208
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,119
look for jobs not directly going like

1209
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,800
software engineering to the big

1210
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,640
companies but looking for other

1211
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,000
opportunities

1212
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,920
maybe just working in that domain in

1213
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,720
cyber physical systems so as a faculty

1214
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,720
uh what we do is we are trying to you

1215
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,200
know like get some

1216
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,520
some systems some test beds

1217
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,240
to our laboratories uh to give a

1218
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,040
hands-on experience we use these systems

1219
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,319
for research

1220
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,720
also try to integrate these systems

1221
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,040
in our courses as well and whenever

1222
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,960
there are like some opportunities in our

1223
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,160
department um like aspiring girls or

1224
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,760
sometimes like in summer high school

1225
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,839
students comes and visits art department

1226
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,839
we kind of demonstrate these systems to

1227
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,240
these students in order to achieve the

1228
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,839
previous goals that i mentioned

1229
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,520
thank you

1230
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,200
um

1231
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,040
now we'll turn to the

1232
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,950
the audience uh and

1233
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,800
[Music]

1234
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,800
put in your questions in the chat uh

1235
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,960
but first if if the panel has any

1236
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,040
questions they'd like to pose to one

1237
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,200
another that's you can jump in as well

1238
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,839
but there is a question

1239
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,920
uh that's come up about

1240
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,079
i guess it'd be

1241
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,880
prevention shall we call it so

1242
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,000
global laws should

1243
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,440
can laws

1244
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,000
related to cyber crimes and uh

1245
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,760
cyber security can they make an impact

1246
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,720
in this

1247
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,559
domain in your

1248
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,440
in your opinions

1249
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,359
so i'd like to say laws

1250
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,240
well

1251
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,040
hackers aren't going to follow the laws

1252
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,599
so i don't think it matters what really

1253
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,839
matters to us is

1254
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:30,960
what the

1255
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,960
is getting the right regulations so that

1256
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,720
we design cyber safe systems

1257
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,240
and we get the law makers and regulators

1258
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,800
to understand to have a better

1259
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,559
understanding of

1260
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,040
what cyber is and how it is because it

1261
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,200
it really is a different

1262
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,079
viewpoint in a different reality

1263
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,480
safety is all about functional hazard

1264
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,599
assessment

1265
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,839
10 to the minus ninth is safe it's

1266
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,920
deterministic cyber's not deterministic

1267
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,760
it's going to be the same emerging thing

1268
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,920
that we have with the autonomy and the

1269
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,359
ai

1270
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,839
and that type of work you know we're

1271
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,160
going to have this fundamental shift and

1272
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,400
that's what's really exciting about this

1273
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,520
is that

1274
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,440
you know fundamentally we're gonna have

1275
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,640
to shift over the next five ten years to

1276
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,880
a different way of viewing things and

1277
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,599
cyber is just one piece of it that's

1278
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,240
gonna be very interesting

1279
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,640
agree john

1280
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,879
um

1281
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,559
so if you had to guess

1282
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,000
and i'll let you take this question in

1283
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,800
whichever direction you would like but

1284
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,359
in the next five years and so certainly

1285
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,240
long term but not an extreme long time

1286
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,960
where is the area that you have that you

1287
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,000
believe is probably going to have the

1288
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,800
most advances in cyber security for the

1289
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,599
aero industry uh i bring this up the

1290
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,480
which spurred my question is that

1291
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,920
mike gone rolls-royce and i have been

1292
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,920
working on a couple of projects that are

1293
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,920
looking at adding ai systems to cyber uh

1294
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,520
intrusion detection with some of these

1295
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,680
systems but but we've had some very deep

1296
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,119
conversations on

1297
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,640
what what are the areas that we're not

1298
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,280
thinking about that may have tremendous

1299
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,400
asset to aerocyber so uh if any of the

1300
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,160
panelists have uh have comments on that

1301
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,119
so i think from an overall aviation

1302
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,960
industry

1303
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,119
the the what we talked about with the

1304
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,559
urban air mobility and the utm

1305
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,960
because that is computers working with

1306
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,160
computers to keep people safe

1307
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,040
and currently like i said with air

1308
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,119
traffic control

1309
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,760
we we basically keep people safe by

1310
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,079
people monitoring something and people

1311
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,839
talking to each other

1312
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:01,599
so this whole shift to where it's a

1313
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,000
computer talking to a computer

1314
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,640
is going to be the area how do we do

1315
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,200
digital identification there is no

1316
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,680
standards no international standards or

1317
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,680
any kind of standards for that

1318
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,160
you know we just released a system

1319
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,440
uh adsb there's no authentication anyone

1320
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,880
can spoof it

1321
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,440
you know we cyber hasn't been thought of

1322
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,359
i think that's the big area is that

1323
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,040
cyber will get in

1324
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,760
into these different areas and the atm

1325
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,160
utm is going to be the first area that's

1326
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,040
going to

1327
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,040
pull the rest of us dragging with our

1328
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,280
heels in the sand

1329
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,640
into the

1330
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,799
cyber uh digital world

1331
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,960
interesting comment john i i relay that

1332
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,480
to some conversation we've had with

1333
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,480
other serious partners that are not

1334
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,400
necessarily in the arrow more in the

1335
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,839
astro and actually some in the air

1336
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,000
motive and very interesting thoughts

1337
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,440
that actually align with some of these

1338
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,040
others that are dealing with

1339
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,559
as i returned to my opening comments

1340
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,960
this cyber plus what is some of these

1341
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,720
other areas that are not in i.t that are

1342
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,559
dealing with these things

1343
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:07,839
um

1344
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,599
in such i know that you have dealt a lot

1345
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,359
in there what in your research you

1346
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,680
seeing that may be areas of potential

1347
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,800
gains

1348
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,040
that we could see within the next five

1349
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,760
years or so

1350
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,480
um so the two things one is the

1351
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,640
application domain in aero industry that

1352
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,359
the i chunk in with

1353
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,240
john

1354
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,319
so uam utm and atm areas are the

1355
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,559
fundamental areas that we can see a lot

1356
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,400
of improvements in there

1357
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,880
and these are mainly the as you

1358
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,720
mentioned that the mostly

1359
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,119
automation-based operations

1360
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,280
and then they are everybody connects to

1361
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,760
everybody opens the door no

1362
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,839
communication protocol there are there

1363
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,520
are communication protocols but no

1364
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,079
encryptions and nothing safety security

1365
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,880
measures taking place they even though

1366
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,640
they are now start looking into the

1367
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,520
problems so some advancements and then

1368
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,920
the government setting up the uh some

1369
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,079
regulations and the rules and the

1370
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,680
guidelines that

1371
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,800
and so the industry and research

1372
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,119
institute and then academia work

1373
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,359
together to come up with

1374
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,079
technologies to to address those those

1375
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,079
areas and another one is that the

1376
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,040
now

1377
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,359
machine learning ai based technologies

1378
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,599
has been advanced so far but at the same

1379
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,760
time our systems different from the

1380
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,480
traditional the ai domain for example

1381
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,760
the

1382
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,640
phase recognition there is no dynamics

1383
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,720
but the airplanes follows vehicle

1384
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,960
follows newtonian mechanics we know that

1385
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,920
for last 300 years why we ignore it as

1386
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,160
if we do we do not know anything

1387
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,280
and then we so the i'm thinking my

1388
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,480
perspective is that the this model based

1389
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,280
approach plus data driven approach

1390
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,520
and each method can complement each

1391
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,440
other's work and the model driven

1392
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,160
approach traditional analytically driven

1393
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,319
approach has a lot of good things in the

1394
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:07,680
sense that we can prove its property

1395
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,520
we can guarantee the properties

1396
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,240
mathematically not just the simulations

1397
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,160
but machine learning based one if it is

1398
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,760
working well it's working right but

1399
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,480
nobody can say it's definitively working

1400
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,880
in that way under any circumstances

1401
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,640
that's very very very challenging area

1402
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,880
right so formal education validation

1403
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,800
place has an important very important

1404
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,400
role especially air industry

1405
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,800
certification is big part of it and

1406
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,559
certifying something is very very

1407
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,760
difficult so that area will be a very

1408
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,920
very important area and we can see some

1409
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,839
advancements if there are any

1410
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,599
significant advancements in in those

1411
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,040
areas

1412
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,359
i i would say that any sub industry

1413
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,880
would welcome the opportunity to have

1414
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,040
some cyber metrics that actually

1415
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,240
quantified exactly how secure we are but

1416
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,680
that's another that's a topic for

1417
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,480
another panelist

1418
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,200
yeah so uh

1419
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,839
burkay uh in computer science i i and

1420
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:03,839
i've had the uh obviously the pleasure

1421
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,280
of getting to hear you talk before and

1422
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,119
some of your specific research but when

1423
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,200
it comes to hardening controls or the

1424
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,559
control systems for these some of these

1425
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,720
zero systems is there an area there that

1426
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,319
you think we can take some monumental

1427
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:17,200
jumps in the next five years or so

1428
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,280
um yes

1429
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,359
um first of all um

1430
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,839
i mean uh it's all technology what we

1431
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,720
see recently is being like automated

1432
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,920
right

1433
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,200
um however like uh in aviation

1434
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,559
because they are

1435
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,520
exposed to physical domain

1436
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,079
right there are many uncontrolled

1437
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,880
uh i would say noise or environmental

1438
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,079
factors right so this kind of makes

1439
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,400
very difficult to model the correct

1440
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,640
operation of the system so once we have

1441
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,720
the correct operation of the system

1442
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,559
anything deviates from that correct

1443
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,799
operation we would say that either this

1444
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,960
is cast by an adversary or maybe this is

1445
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,559
a fault right

1446
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,799
so what i see is

1447
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:04,240
um

1448
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,079
because we are trying to make everything

1449
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,640
automated we need to also

1450
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,599
test these systems in order to see their

1451
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,839
operations are correct however

1452
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,079
historically we also know that these

1453
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,480
systems are complex

1454
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,440
so

1455
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,119
it's very difficult to model these

1456
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,640
systems or it's very difficult to verify

1457
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,400
whether a property

1458
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,280
or requirement holds on the system or

1459
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,640
not this is because it has a very huge

1460
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,079
input space and there are some

1461
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,079
linearities and the systems are

1462
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,240
non-deterministic and also they have a

1463
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,160
hybrid nature right

1464
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,839
so what i see is the model based design

1465
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,760
the model based abstraction of these

1466
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,880
systems becomes very important which i

1467
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,640
see that recently they call it like a

1468
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,359
kind of digital tv as well in some cases

1469
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,520
right it's a kind of virtual replica

1470
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,040
that you can run

1471
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,359
and then see

1472
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,040
the real operation of the system and

1473
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,280
this virtual replica

1474
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,599
are like correct or deviates from each

1475
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,040
other

1476
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,200
of course this requires a set of

1477
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,119
technical skills like how we can

1478
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,119
abstract how we can analyze the source

1479
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,520
code and then create a model and then

1480
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,599
after we create the model how we can

1481
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,920
ensure that this is realistic and how we

1482
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,319
can develop some approaches in order to

1483
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,799
run on these models to test these

1484
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,079
systems

1485
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,559
um so models has like multiple different

1486
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,720
purposes that's what i see

1487
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,079
and this model is basically um

1488
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,920
extracted from the the source code

1489
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,760
because the source code manages its

1490
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,520
behavior

1491
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,599
in that sense

1492
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,839
the model design the program analysis

1493
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:46,960
techniques

1494
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,920
um

1495
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,000
the fuzzing techniques in order to find

1496
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,400
these bugs and formal verification

1497
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,839
techniques in order to ensure uh formal

1498
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,240
safety and security guarantees

1499
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,599
i think becoming extremely important

1500
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,079
because we cannot just give inputs and

1501
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,799
test these systems it's not safe right

1502
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,440
and the input space as i said it's very

1503
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,760
huge

1504
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,280
mike i want to change up the question a

1505
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,160
little bit for you um in that

1506
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,880
uh sirius and purdue is is very proud

1507
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,000
and pleased to be part of the

1508
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
rolls-royce cyber technology research

1509
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,480
network uh along with our peers at the

1510
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,040
scilab at carnegie mellon and then a

1511
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,760
university to be named i know in january

1512
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,559
uh uh very exciting but this is a

1513
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,559
monumental program that rolls royce has

1514
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:39,839
decided okay we're going to partner with

1515
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:42,000
just a handful of universities who have

1516
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,440
deep expertise in air oh cyber to help

1517
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,839
address these problems so

1518
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,520
from your perspective as kind of the

1519
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,000
program manager for this entire research

1520
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,720
program you know what are your kind of

1521
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,400
those intermediate five year out what

1522
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,720
are you hoping that that uh that we can

1523
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,480
solve i i don't think that we're going

1524
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,240
to solve all of the cyber security

1525
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,640
programs for the aero industry but what

1526
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,319
is your what are you kind of considering

1527
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:08,079
this low-hanging or maybe not quite

1528
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:09,920
low-hanging fruit but that you're hoping

1529
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,960
that we can make monumental uh increases

1530
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,880
in in contributing to the uh the

1531
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,559
security the cyber and cyber physical

1532
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,240
security of roll rolls race products

1533
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,119
uh that's that's a good question so um

1534
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,960
there's a number of different areas that

1535
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,359
that we're interested in that could make

1536
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,640
big changes

1537
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,240
uh in in the security of our products i

1538
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,200
think

1539
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,119
you know there's different components to

1540
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,160
that

1541
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,160
you mentioned the ai bit

1542
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,520
it was mentioned earlier mbse and

1543
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,640
in digital twins those are all areas i

1544
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,160
think are are right for uh for research

1545
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,920
and that could make a

1546
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,079
make things especially in these embedded

1547
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,400
systems that that fly around

1548
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,359
uh much more easy to to understand if

1549
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,400
there is an intrusion in the system

1550
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,599
and

1551
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,000
but they are complex and and those are

1552
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,160
not trivial

1553
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,920
problems to solve

1554
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,799
um

1555
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:11,359
there's also um

1556
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,880
i think that um

1557
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,240
i just lost my train of thought so

1558
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,000
apologies there um i i think that uh

1559
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,760
um

1560
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,079
the uh other pieces that that we're

1561
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:23,440
looking at

1562
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,839
um that one of the key foundational

1563
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:26,839
pieces is

1564
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,040
architecture um and

1565
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,960
and it it it hits um from both the

1566
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,319
certification side um that safety versus

1567
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,799
the security side there's lots of things

1568
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:41,040
that that we could probably do better to

1569
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,680
help help be able to move at pace of the

1570
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,000
attacker while maintaining that that

1571
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,480
critical safety

1572
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,480
aspect of our stuff

1573
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,799
of our products

1574
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,599
well thank you all um i think we have

1575
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:02,799
hit the

1576
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,880
the ending point here i i really

1577
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,079
appreciate
