1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,960
so as a short introduction uh welcome

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,919
again to

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,520
uh the weekly security seminar

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,920
i'm just delighted to finally be able to

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,719
introduce

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,920
uh ira winkler ira and i have known each

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,320
other

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,000
for um we measured in decades

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,199
uh and and ira is one of the

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,240
the best known people uh working in

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,560
in security particularly in areas of

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,760
human aspects

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,240
he's a noted lecturer and speaker it's

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,840
hard to go to any major conference

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,440
without uh hearing him

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,360
him talk there author of several books

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,480
and just a a wonderful resource in the

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,120
area

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,960
of actually applying security

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,160
so with that um you can find out lots

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,320
more about them online if you're curious

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,800
but uh it's worth listening to and and

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,719
ira please take it away

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,840
okay thanks i'm honored what can i say

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,399
so

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,199
anyway let's talk about you know what i

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,800
consider the problem because

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,799
you know human security engineering i

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,000
want that to become

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,520
top on people's lips because right now

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,680
if a user makes a mis right now if

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,439
there's an awareness problem

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,759
everybody says oh it's an awareness

34
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,479
problem i go

35
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,400
the problem is it's not an awareness

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,759
problem it is a

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,880
system problem it is a problem of the

38
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,320
entire system

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,920
i'm going to talk about this a little

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,240
bit more but generally

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,479
the problem is in safety science if a

42
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,400
user injures themselves

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,680
then everybody says oh it's not why did

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,439
the person injure themselves

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,600
it's why did the system allow the person

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,640
to be injured

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,960
and why did that injury propagate as an

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,840
example

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,439
in accounting and i'll give you this

50
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,439
example if a cfo

51
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,280
ever walked into a board meeting and

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,600
said hey you know what we just lost

53
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,159
20 million dollars but that was because

54
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,399
a user did something they shouldn't have

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,320
we can't blame the user

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,880
oh you know we can and then the ceo

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,320
would interrupt him he's like you know

58
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,920
what we can't blame the user

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,520
we blame you mr c cfo because

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,679
you were responsible for implementing

61
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,840
systems that don't result in 20 million

62
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,040
dollar losses

63
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,840
as an example so anyway keep that in

64
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,560
mind as i

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,480
progress and hopefully my slides are

66
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,959
working well

67
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,120
so let's talk about the twitter hack

68
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,959
first in the twitter hack

69
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,120
everybody was there and everybody you

70
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,879
know when it was announced what did

71
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,560
twitter say twitter came out with a

72
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,680
press release

73
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,319
of some form it was written by a tech

74
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,680
guy

75
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,800
and they just described it as a highly

76
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,480
sophisticated social engineering attack

77
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,800
and it's like okay and what did they do

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,239
what did twitter say they were going to

79
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:46,800
do

80
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,640
they were going to implement better

81
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,560
awareness training

82
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,440
now i hope there was more but you know

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,959
essentially what they did was

84
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,319
here's what essentially happened with

85
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,920
the twitter hack as far as we know at

86
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,959
the moment

87
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,800
some mastermind who turns out to be a 17

88
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,000
year old kid

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and frankly i'm not downplaying that the

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,159
fact he was 17 years old as a kid and

91
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,280
being a criminal

92
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,440
i'm down playing calling someone a

93
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,480
mastermind

94
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,879
who is 17 years old i mean i hate to

95
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,920
break it to twitter

96
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,000
but i could tell you the gru china

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,440
israel the us whoever else has much more

98
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,840
better masterminds than this you they

99
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,760
should be embarrassed by the fact they

100
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,599
call this person a mastermind

101
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,920
but anyway what the person did was they

102
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,040
essentially created

103
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,200
men in the middle attacks where they

104
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,879
essentially said okay we're going to try

105
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,560
to log into somebody

106
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,480
they went ahead there was multi-factor

107
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,680
authentication

108
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,000
they sent an email link to the person in

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,760
some form doing a vision text and we

110
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,599
need you to authenticate yourself

111
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,200
the person appeared to authenticate

112
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,280
themselves the criminals basically

113
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,439
intercepted the code the person was

114
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,319
entering

115
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,439
onto the system and then they

116
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,439
entered the code and then they got that

117
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,360
person's access on twitter

118
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
they found out that there was a central

119
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,560
repository

120
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,120
that contained the set of tools that

121
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,439
allow people to reset passwords

122
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,360
and don't worry twitter had it all

123
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,480
nailed down because

124
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,120
only a thousand people were able to

125
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,880
access that set of tools so

126
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,199
clearly twenty percent just limiting it

127
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,358
to twenty percent of the population

128
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,160
to change president obama's password who

129
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
has a hundred million

130
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,919
plus twitter accounts is clearly a

131
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,600
highly sophisticated thing

132
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,919
of course it wasn't highly sophisticated

133
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:32,720
it was a

134
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,000
systematic problem built into the entire

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,199
security issue

136
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,520
yes it was a little clever that the

137
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,400
person did

138
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,440
a wishing attack to a certain extent but

139
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,120
just because a person gets somebody's

140
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,479
access it doesn't mean they should

141
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,120
change

142
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,840
a whole bunch of high-profile accounts

143
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,960
just because they have

144
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,520
random access to a tool and just in case

145
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,880
anybody says oh well who could have

146
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,000
foreseen

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,639
they should know that it was two years

148
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,600
before

149
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,800
some person left twitter who was a

150
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
temporary employee and he was not very

151
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,440
pleased with

152
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,320
um you know trump donald trump and he

153
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,160
deleted donald trump's account on the

154
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,120
way out

155
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
so clearly they knew there were errors

156
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,840
in the making in this situation

157
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,680
anyway um so next so the 17 year old

158
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,919
mastermind social engineering dishing

159
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,639
tools thousands of people next we have

160
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,000
cloudflare

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,800
and what happened with cloudflare was

162
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,880
and this had nothing necessarily to do

163
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,800
with security but it had everything to

164
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,440
do with security and the human aspect

165
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,280
what happened was for those people who

166
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,360
remember and most people don't

167
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,680
there was a major outage of cloudflare

168
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,840
which provides a lot of content

169
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,120
internet data across the world and

170
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,600
so what happened was the ceo got on his

171
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,360
twitter account and said something to

172
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,639
the effect

173
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,520
that an engineer was essentially

174
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,720
responsible for misconfiguring a table

175
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,600
the table then led to the outage and

176
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,400
somebody

177
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,759
tweets back to the ceo and they

178
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,120
basically said

179
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
oh i would hate to be that engineer

180
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,680
and the ceo much infinitely to his

181
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,000
credit said it's not the fault of a

182
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,600
single engineer

183
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,319
this failure was a failure of leadership

184
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,120
because

185
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,600
anybody who was able to take you know

186
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,800
the fact that

187
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,199
a single error was able to take down

188
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,400
their network

189
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,960
that's a failure of the entire system

190
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,479
and therefore a failure of the

191
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,560
leadership of the company

192
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,120
and let's see so moving on and why i

193
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,560
highlight those two

194
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,919
you know um count juxtaposing those two

195
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,680
you know those both happened at about

196
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,919
the same time very different reaction

197
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,120
from the company

198
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,759
and when i do parallels old school

199
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,440
safety science like i did in

200
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,919
the pseudo introduction you know at the

201
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,960
time it was

202
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,880
why did the user do what they did why

203
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,680
was the user so stupid was essentially

204
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,960
the cry of safety science practitioners

205
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,759
then um the next thing was there was a

206
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,560
focus on the proximity of the error

207
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,479
in other words where the error occurred

208
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,120
they say that's where the solution has

209
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,639
to be

210
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,199
and there was always analysis of why the

211
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,479
user was wrong

212
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,319
they never stopped to look at what were

213
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,080
the contributing factors

214
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,800
to putting the user in that position or

215
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,919
whatever else

216
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,759
and i kind of look at it and you know

217
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,599
when you look at sydney decker's work

218
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,720
and for those of you

219
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,080
you know if you really want to take a

220
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,240
deep dive or even a little dive

221
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,479
into the field of safety science you

222
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,680
could go to youtube

223
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,840
and see some of sydney decker's um

224
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,240
online courses he has some great ones

225
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,400
on new school of safety science and so

226
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,840
on but anyway

227
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,560
he has the analogy that basically you

228
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:50,960
know

229
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,120
it used to be that if a canary died in

230
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,160
the coal mine

231
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,800
the analog the saying was oh we just

232
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,240
need healthier canaries

233
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,639
likewise in cyber security that's our

234
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,599
attitude

235
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,879
you know if somebody injures themselves

236
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,800
or somebody make clicks you know clicks

237
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,319
on a phishing message and ruins the

238
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,759
network they say we just need a more

239
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,879
aware user

240
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,720
again that's like saying if a canary

241
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,240
dies in a coal mine we just need

242
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,919
healthier canaries

243
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,720
that is not the problem the purpose of a

244
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,759
canary is

245
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,400
dying in a coal mine in that case you

246
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,080
don't want a canary to die from

247
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,400
old age or something like that clearly

248
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,840
but at the same time

249
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,240
you don't blame the canary for the gas

250
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,520
in the coal mine nor

251
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,519
should you be blaming the user because

252
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,679
they click on something

253
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,320
and you know here's the you know in

254
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,080
operational problems

255
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,760
you know when we talk about you know

256
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,360
mechanical breakdowns like

257
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,880
why did um you know proximity doesn't

258
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,600
explain

259
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,440
a lot you know so for example in

260
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,560
mechanical breakdowns just as an example

261
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,080
when i had a generator that i would use

262
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,160
when the power outage happened

263
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,200
you know one time the generator blew and

264
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,800
why did the generator blew blow because

265
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,839
blew a gasket why because i was a genius

266
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,920
and never checked the oil level so it

267
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,320
was

268
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,839
out of oil the problem wasn't that

269
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,440
i went ahead and started the engine

270
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
the problem was that nobody was doing

271
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,120
preventative maintenance yes that was

272
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,399
still me but it's

273
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,959
me in a different place and time there

274
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,080
should have been preventative

275
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,279
maintenance in place

276
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,680
same thing with like for example buses

277
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,600
you don't blame a bus driver if the

278
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,440
brakes of the bus fail and the driver

279
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,600
does everything he possibly could to

280
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,800
save the bus

281
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,279
it's a failure in the maintenance in

282
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,399
medicine

283
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,560
every time somebody dies in a hospital

284
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,959
they have regular meetings to cover

285
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,000
why did this happen what happened during

286
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,880
a surgery that you know for example

287
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,760
example

288
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,360
a doctor prescribed or like an

289
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,800
anesthesiologist putting the wrong type

290
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,440
of

291
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,760
you know drug into the person's system

292
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,200
or too much of the drug

293
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,640
everybody's like oh well the problem is

294
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,160
you put in too much of the drug right

295
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,640
there

296
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,600
no when you look at medical errors

297
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,680
inside complicated environments

298
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,720
they realize that there are a set

299
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,200
of events that happen you know that

300
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,160
happened like

301
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,240
a thousand actions might happen during

302
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,399
an individual operation

303
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,760
and an error almost became

304
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,959
you know imminent when uh when a doctor

305
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,320
went down a certain path

306
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,680
and then the question is why did the

307
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,519
doctor go down that path

308
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,519
because at the time the doctor didn't

309
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,640
just make in all

310
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,360
most cases the doctor just doesn't make

311
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,680
a

312
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,399
stupid mistake the doctor did the best

313
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,160
decision available to them

314
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,279
at that time so again what

315
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,680
led to the doctor making that decision

316
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
at that time for that reason

317
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,519
that's how other fields look at the

318
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,800
problem

319
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,480
and then coming back to new school

320
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,160
safety science you know the way we

321
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,240
should be looking at cyber security

322
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,560
the user is as much a part of the system

323
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,160
as the computer

324
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,839
you know a safety incident results from

325
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,760
a failing of the entire system

326
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
you have to look at what are all the

327
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,440
enabling factors

328
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,320
and the user in many cases is just the

329
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,160
proximity of the error

330
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,079
and the proximity of the error is not

331
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,519
the cause of the error

332
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,920
the proximity error is the inevitable

333
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,680
symptom of the error

334
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,720
if you can't breathe for example sorry

335
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,399
this is a bad case with the latest news

336
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,399
events i wasn't planning for covent

337
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,959
but if you can't breathe and you're in a

338
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:31,680
hospital

339
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
they have to know oh well you can't

340
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,079
breathe why can't you breathe

341
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,040
is the right question to ask not just

342
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,200
the fact that person can't breathe

343
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,920
you have to solve the underlying problem

344
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,600
you know solving the immediate problem

345
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,480
is one thing but

346
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,040
if you really want to prevent cyber

347
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,240
security incidents

348
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,560
you have to solve the underlying problem

349
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
and again a user error

350
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,880
clicking on a phishing message is only

351
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,079
what's wrong

352
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,240
is only a symptom of what's wrong in the

353
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,600
entire system

354
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
and i'll cover that now let's look at

355
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,160
the boeing 737 max i think they're

356
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,399
starting to come back into production

357
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,079
when the two 737 max max jets crashed

358
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,600
they essentially

359
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,040
nose dot nosedive into the ground

360
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,120
you know you had pilots the pilots

361
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,959
couldn't get control of their airplane

362
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,040
and everybody from the start was like oh

363
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,160
this is clearly

364
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,279
pilot error and you stop and wonder

365
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,760
why is a pilot error you know and then

366
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,480
you ask

367
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,639
could the pilots have saved the planes

368
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,079
the answer actually

369
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,399
is yes but the problem is

370
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,720
it wasn't just well if the pilots knew

371
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,880
exactly what to do

372
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,959
then clearly they would have known done

373
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,480
it the problem was

374
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,399
could the pilots intuitively figure out

375
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,320
the fact is a lot of pilots did

376
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,800
figure it out but you can't single out

377
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,680
the pilots

378
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,000
the reason the plane's nose dived into

379
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,959
the ground

380
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,440
was because at some point in the

381
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,639
production process

382
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,959
boeing said hey instead of making a

383
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,800
whole new generation of jets and what i

384
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,120
mean by that boeing has for example

385
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,240
737 some 47 57 67

386
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,000
7 77 787 and so on they said instead of

387
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,399
making a 797 for example

388
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,440
we're just going to upgrade the 737

389
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,160
and so they started upgrading it they

390
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,760
took the frame of the jet

391
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,959
you know 737 was a very very safe stable

392
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:27,680
plane

393
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,600
and they had to move it around a bit to

394
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,200
accommodate more people

395
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,959
they had to move the engines up they

396
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,639
were lower to the ground

397
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,639
it caused a variety of different things

398
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,639
that caused the balance of the plane to

399
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,600
be different

400
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,079
so the software controls were modified

401
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,079
and more important than just the balance

402
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,920
and the software controls

403
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,120
they took the sensors and modified the

404
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,079
sensors

405
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,399
they basically said hey you know what

406
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,240
there are these aoas on the side of

407
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
planes and these angle of attacks

408
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,639
say if a plane is going up or a plane is

409
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,120
going down or something to that effect

410
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,959
and what happened was they kind of

411
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,760
adjust and if there was a problem with

412
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,160
that

413
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,040
aoa it would make it look like the plane

414
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,560
might be going into the ground when it

415
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,279
wasn't

416
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,600
and the way ironically you stop a plane

417
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,800
from going into the ground

418
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,199
is to pick up speed and the way you pick

419
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,079
up speed

420
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,160
is by aiming the plane down which then

421
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,680
generates lift

422
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,000
and you know causes the plane to go back

423
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,839
up that's kind of bernoulli principle i

424
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,880
believe it's called

425
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,199
um staff can tell you about this later

426
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,959
perhaps better than i can

427
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,920
but anyway these aoas were faulty and

428
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,639
every time the pilot tried to pick it up

429
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,079
this autopilot would put it down and so

430
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,920
the right solution was to turn off the

431
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,480
autopilot but nobody ever said that

432
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,360
nobody ever trained nobody ever told the

433
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,680
pilots that by the way the sensors

434
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,560
don't work in the 737 max jets the way

435
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,440
they work in the

436
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,639
traditional 737s and the training wasn't

437
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,639
updated they said well the jets

438
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,040
the new ones are so similar the old ones

439
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,800
they just have to like kind of read a

440
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,639
you know read a pamphlet or something to

441
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,120
that effect so

442
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,920
it was a systematic failure and the

443
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,920
pilots were just part of the system that

444
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,440
were not trained that were not

445
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,920
engineered and the right way to catch it

446
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,079
so no it was not pilot error

447
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,680
even though if they figured out how to

448
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,360
do things right perhaps they could have

449
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,480
made it

450
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,560
so now here's another thing you know i'm

451
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,480
telling you a lot of stuff and

452
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,920
you know to a large extent you've been

453
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,680
fed a bunch of ignorant crap the way i

454
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,480
call it

455
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,880
you know everybody loves to mention oh

456
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,800
we're creating the human firewall we're

457
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,399
going to make the users our last line of

458
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,079
defense for the first line of defense

459
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:38,959
and why

460
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,079
because that all sounds great you know

461
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,480
that all is focusing on the proximity of

462
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,360
the error

463
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
and the human firewall as well users

464
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,720
make mistakes let's

465
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,440
be the you know let's fix the proximity

466
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
again by now you know why that's a

467
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,800
failed strategy

468
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,880
and even more important when you look at

469
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,360
the user as your last line of defense

470
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,519
do you know how screwed up that is do

471
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,120
you know how much we failed as an

472
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,079
industry in cyber security if the user

473
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:06,560
given

474
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,399
all the other technologies your last

475
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,720
line of defense and let me tell you why

476
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,120
what happens if a user is malicious

477
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,120
everybody talks about awareness and

478
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,399
human firewall

479
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,800
like the user is well-meaning the user

480
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,000
isn't always well-meaning

481
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,399
sometimes they're apathetic sometimes

482
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,360
they are

483
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,120
over stressed sometimes they have

484
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
competing things but sometimes they're

485
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,440
just

486
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,920
outright malicious what happens if you

487
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,399
have a sociopath as your last line of

488
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,120
defense

489
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,680
as a cso or cyber security professional

490
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,800
as a whole

491
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,000
you have failed massively it's what i

492
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,800
call bro

493
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,000
science somebody picks up a book on like

494
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,920
caldini's book on influences

495
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,399
really big for people in the cyber

496
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,880
security awareness space and it's a

497
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,639
you know it's a decent book that says

498
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,720
how to influence people

499
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,519
now at a high level you think that's you

500
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,639
know great you want to

501
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,120
influence your end user that's kind of

502
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,880
specious thinking because

503
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,720
really when you think about it this is

504
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,000
psychology

505
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,720
not organizational psychology because a

506
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,119
social engineer yes a social engineer

507
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,919
wants to

508
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,119
basically influence a person at a time

509
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,599
you as a cyber security professional in

510
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,199
a large organization

511
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,839
you're not going to a user one by one

512
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,880
you have to go to

513
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,000
everybody you don't if you if you

514
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,919
somehow have the ability to out

515
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,880
touch everybody individually as they

516
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,520
want to be

517
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,840
influenced great but if you're the

518
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,559
normal

519
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,960
cyber security professional you have to

520
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,880
influence people with very limited

521
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,720
resources and you're not going to get to

522
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,520
everybody

523
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,919
you have to figure out how to create a

524
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:44,880
culture

525
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,120
and it's not just and a culture is

526
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,160
influencing

527
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,799
the whole organization behavior not an

528
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,559
individual behavior and hopefully you

529
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,640
understand the difference

530
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,799
anyway but most of these again focus on

531
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,160
the proximity of the era

532
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,080
now let me ask you this all these people

533
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,600
who say they're creating the human

534
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,679
firewall and speak accolades about the

535
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,640
user

536
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,360
they always say that the user is never

537
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,240
at fault

538
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,160
but you know what if you're focused on

539
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,320
the user and the user can fix the

540
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,120
problem

541
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,880
isn't the problem that if a human could

542
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,480
fix it then you're actually saying by

543
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,280
default

544
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,760
the user's at fault if they don't fix it

545
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,640
so again

546
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,880
that's where the problem occurs it's

547
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,160
hypocrisy through

548
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,120
ignorance anyway so now i have newman

549
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,600
here

550
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,000
hopefully you all know who newman is in

551
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,720
this case

552
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,039
you know this isn't a seinfeld talk this

553
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,280
is actually just i needed a cool picture

554
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,400
for accounting

555
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,960
and surprise of surprises there are not

556
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,120
a lot of cool pictures

557
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,760
depicting accounting so anyway i found

558
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,039
this thing of newman

559
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,120
newman in this case is just doing

560
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,039
accounting and the reason i highlighted

561
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,559
it much like i said

562
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,559
you know the accounting field has been

563
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,280
working on user error

564
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,039
more than computers have been in

565
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,200
existence they have put

566
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
processes in place that say hey you know

567
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,840
what a user will make mistakes

568
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,559
you know what a user will be malicious a

569
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,760
user might not

570
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,480
know the process the user will just be

571
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,240
ignorant they just might not care

572
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,360
whatever the thing is

573
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,919
and they don't care why a user does

574
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,200
something they shouldn't

575
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,840
they have established processes in place

576
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,440
that basically define

577
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,320
what a user does how they do it what

578
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,679
they should be doing

579
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,080
and then implementing audit processes

580
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,600
after the fact to ensure

581
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,160
things happen and then when there is

582
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,880
some sort

583
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,799
of loss that is measurable and

584
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,320
concerning

585
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,559
they go back and implement forensic

586
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,480
audits to figure out what happened how

587
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,120
it happened

588
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,919
they never go back and say oh gee you

589
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,000
know maybe we just need better user

590
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,880
training

591
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,720
or maybe we just need it to be funny

592
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,480
because embezzling from the company

593
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,000
should be a funny thing

594
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,720
and again hopefully you see my attitude

595
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,640
i'm funny funny can be nice

596
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,559
but at the same time funny can

597
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,880
trivialize a critical subject too

598
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,440
so you got to do it well but anyway the

599
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,120
other thing is stop and think i don't

600
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,760
know

601
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,400
you know your spaf students most of you

602
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,919
i don't know how many of you might have

603
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,440
to fill out a paycheck or

604
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,760
you know time card at some point in time

605
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,880
to get paid

606
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,240
if you have to travel you have to do

607
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,559
travel reimbursement when i would travel

608
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,080
for large companies

609
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
nobody ever said hey you know what those

610
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,159
travel vouchers are really hard

611
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,679
if you don't want to do it or you don't

612
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,600
get it right don't worry about it

613
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,919
no if i left out my 4.56

614
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,039
frappuccino receipt on a five thousand

615
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:35,520
dollar

616
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,320
travel expense report my whole expense

617
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,080
report was sent back

618
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,320
and nobody ever said oh poor ira has to

619
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,919
pay his credit card bill of five

620
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:44,960
thousand dollars

621
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,120
but they won't you know but they want a

622
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,799
four dollar receipt and that's so

623
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,760
hard to get all the receipts nobody ever

624
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,880
says that why

625
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,280
because it's accepted that this is part

626
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,080
of your job

627
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,480
this is how we do business if you don't

628
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,240
want to keep the receipts then you don't

629
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,440
get reimbursed

630
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,200
because they need the receipts for their

631
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,280
purposes because

632
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,080
fraud happens mistakes happen so they

633
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,960
want to make sure

634
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,280
it's all accounted for even though they

635
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
spent much more in their accounting

636
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,960
processes than my four dollar

637
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,080
frappuccino

638
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,600
the reality though is that these

639
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520
processes are in place because they also

640
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,960
catch the larger

641
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,120
either mismanagement mishandling or

642
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,559
malfeasance

643
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,960
so anyway here's scuba diving a lot of

644
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,679
people well

645
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:28,960
most people wouldn't know it but i'm a

646
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,720
master scuba diver

647
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,440
and when i train students you know you

648
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,640
know i stopped and thinking

649
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,400
fundamentally i'm going to step back the

650
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,320
first time i ever heard the expression

651
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,679
you can't c-a-n-t stop stupid

652
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,600
was when i was doing my instructor

653
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
training the course director he was

654
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,799
telling us it's like look

655
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,799
no matter what you do somebody's going

656
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,559
to do something stupid you can't stop

657
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,360
stupid

658
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,799
and i'm sitting there thinking you know

659
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,600
what our whole instructor training is

660
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,080
about

661
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,480
stopping stupid you know what are the

662
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,039
procedures what are the safety protocols

663
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,120
what do students do the whole dive

664
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,520
industry could not exist if we

665
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,640
didn't endeavor to stop stupid so

666
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,919
for example before we put students you

667
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:12,640
know take on

668
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,480
students they have to fill out a health

669
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,320
questionnaire you know we have to put

670
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,000
them in a pool and make sure they're not

671
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,080
going to freak out in the water does it

672
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,760
do we care if they swim not really we

673
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,039
just want to make sure that they won't

674
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,039
freak out because you don't need to swim

675
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,640
because you have dive equipment if you

676
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,480
do it right so then

677
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,520
we go ahead then we give them you know

678
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,320
about dozens of hours of training you

679
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,080
know mostly online these days

680
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,600
where they then have to take a test to

681
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,200
make sure and all that training is

682
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
pretty much to make sure

683
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,559
that they know how they should not kill

684
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,600
themselves

685
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,720
then once they're ready to go inside a

686
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,760
um a facility and get in the water we

687
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,440
take them to a pool the pool is

688
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,760
you know never more than 15 feet deep we

689
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,440
however still start them out in the

690
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,320
shallow end

691
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,000
we check out their equipment we tell

692
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,520
them to check out their equipment

693
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,280
we put it on you know we make sure that

694
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,200
the equipment's safe and secure before

695
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,000
we put them in

696
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,600
then we put them in the low end and if

697
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,200
they're comfortable take them slowly to

698
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,400
the deeper end

699
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,760
and then if they could do everything

700
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
there then we take them back

701
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,240
out into open water and the open water

702
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,480
or platform like you see on your screen

703
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,640
is going to be no more than 30 feet deep

704
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,720
usually around 15 feet deep

705
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,679
you know as good visibility as possible

706
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,400
and then

707
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,320
even then when you see here this is like

708
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,720
you know i assume this is an instructor

709
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,880
trying to test people on a fin pivot

710
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,880
because you could see the person

711
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,520
that is um i don't have to see my cursor

712
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,000
that looks

713
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,080
like the instructor who's working with a

714
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,760
student trying to get them to do a fin

715
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,640
pivot where they

716
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,039
just basically hover up and down he has

717
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,120
to look at one student at a time and i

718
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,200
wasn't doing something like this once

719
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,919
and i had one of my brilliant students

720
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:50,559
decide

721
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,400
let's look under the platform where they

722
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,000
could essentially wedge themselves in

723
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,200
and kill themselves

724
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,360
but anyway i saw them at the corner of

725
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
my eye but more important when i'm

726
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,279
when i'm doing something like this you

727
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,880
should see over there

728
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
there's a direct let's see is the red

729
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,200
circle there um hopefully the red circle

730
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,039
appeared it's covered up on my screen

731
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:09,600
but

732
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,360
anyway you should see there's a there's

733
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
an assistant instructor or dive master

734
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
that a good instructor brings with them

735
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,760
that hovers around looking for things

736
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,720
because you know

737
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,039
proactively an instructor won't be able

738
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,120
to watch everybody at all times so you

739
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,159
bring help

740
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,039
and then even with all this happening we

741
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:27,600
have

742
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,960
insurance for the school we have

743
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,320
insurance for the instructor we have

744
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,080
insurance for the facility if there's a

745
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,840
boat we have insurance for the boat

746
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,400
if there is you know we even take out a

747
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
policy for the students that they mostly

748
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,360
don't know about

749
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,919
we know where first aid is oxygen is we

750
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:42,880
have basically

751
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,039
implemented risk management into the

752
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,760
entire scuba instruction process which

753
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,480
makes it safer than bowling in general

754
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,720
so now when you look at where blaine

755
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,840
falls

756
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,919
90 percent of the blame and this is back

757
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,279
to safety science

758
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,360
when somebody injures themselves in

759
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
safety science ninety percent of the

760
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,919
failure

761
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,240
is in the environment for example a

762
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,159
hammer might fall off a table on

763
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,520
somebody's foot

764
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,360
um i was once working with a

765
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,440
manufacturing organization implementing

766
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,960
an awareness program

767
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,720
and they were telling me it's like well

768
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,320
we used to have forklifts in the

769
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
warehouse that would run into people

770
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,080
because people and forklifts could go

771
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,159
wherever they want so finally they just

772
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:22,960
said you know what

773
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
they did a big study then they said the

774
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,000
best solution

775
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,640
big yellow lines down the center of the

776
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,840
warehouse aisles

777
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,919
people stay to one side forklift stayed

778
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,279
the other cut out

779
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,000
almost all the all the accidents they

780
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,760
had just during a line down the

781
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,559
factory floor what was the last 10 that

782
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,159
was the user error

783
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,159
where somebody might have been careless

784
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,000
that was when somebody for example would

785
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,440
be on their iphone and

786
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,720
kind of wander aimlessly into the path

787
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,799
of a forklift or the forklift driver

788
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,799
was somehow careless not looking where

789
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,159
he was backing into or

790
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,159
something like that but that's where

791
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,080
blaine falls ninety percent of the

792
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,960
environment

793
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,799
even with fishing and i'll throw this

794
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,240
out because i'm probably gonna go into

795
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,960
it later

796
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,600
even with fishing what does the user

797
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,000
fall for fishing was the user stupid

798
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
let me ask you this question why is the

799
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,080
phishing message in the inbox in the

800
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,760
first place

801
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,840
people have to be asking that for a

802
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,080
phishing message to be in that inbox

803
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,679
that means that a whole bunch of

804
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,440
technology failed before the user is

805
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,039
given a chance to fail

806
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,520
so keep that in mind as we go along

807
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,120
what's the last ten percent though

808
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,039
carelessness blatant ignorance lack of

809
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,400
training malice

810
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,080
you know this is kind of where awareness

811
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,320
and training can fit in kind of

812
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,240
but it's still only ten percent of the

813
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,440
problem i know

814
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,520
sirius is supposed to be

815
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,799
interdisciplinary so let's talk about

816
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,960
the concept of applied behavioral

817
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,919
science

818
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,320
and in behind implied behavioral science

819
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,840
you know there's broad ways of looking

820
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,400
at it

821
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,240
i like this way of looking at it in

822
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,159
other words why do people behave the way

823
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,200
they do

824
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,440
you have antecedents antecedents are

825
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,559
essentially

826
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,000
information provided you know by you

827
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,880
your awareness program what guides

828
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,440
people

829
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,480
to influence a behavior and then

830
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,159
once a behavior happens there's a

831
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,480
consequence to all behaviors

832
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,279
there is a consequence the consequences

833
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,880
can either be positive

834
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,520
negative or neutral so let me ask you a

835
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,399
quick question

836
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,960
what is the benefit because a quick

837
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,640
cyber security example

838
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,799
we always tell our users don't reuse

839
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,000
your passwords

840
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,360
you know don't reuse your business

841
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,120
password don't reuse your personal

842
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,720
password on your business account don't

843
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,360
reuse

844
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,880
your business password on your personal

845
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,559
accounts but guess what

846
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,960
we tell them this and that influences

847
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,120
about 20 percent of the behavior

848
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
then everybody knows they shouldn't do

849
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,159
it but you know what

850
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,080
it's kind of annoying to keep lots of

851
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,240
passwords so what do they do

852
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,600
they go ahead and they reuse the

853
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,320
password anyway what is the consequence

854
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,640
for that

855
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,559
99.9 percent of the time there are no

856
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,399
consequences and guess what

857
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,320
that makes the consequence actually

858
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,440
positive

859
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,200
and the reason it's positive is because

860
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,919
they have to learn one less password

861
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,000
so that way they're more likely to reuse

862
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,520
the password again

863
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,279
and this consequence is 80 and so on

864
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,039
you know the only time people get burned

865
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,559
is if somebody actually you know

866
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,960
their passwords end up getting you know

867
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,399
hacked off one site

868
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,880
get put on you got phoned or somewhere

869
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,320
like on the dark web

870
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,480
and then it gets compromised in that way

871
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,240
for example i don't know how many people

872
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,320
remember the when the ring accounts were

873
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,000
compromised where

874
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,840
some bad people they basically went

875
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,279
ahead out on

876
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,679
the dark web they found user ids and

877
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,520
password combinations through a bunch of

878
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,520
compromised accounts and they said hey

879
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,200
here's the bank you know here bank

880
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,799
credentials that were compromised what's

881
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,799
the likelihood that somebody at a given

882
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,520
bank

883
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,320
is going to have um a ring account so

884
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,159
they just went ahead and started taking

885
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,520
those password

886
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,080
user id password combinations and fed

887
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,200
them into ring

888
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,279
and guess what they got access to

889
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,279
people's accounts and they were able

890
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,520
to talk to people's children insult

891
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,240
people steal cameras screen shots

892
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,399
all that sort of stuff then they got the

893
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,840
consequence then they said hey

894
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,679
maybe i should actually implement better

895
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:12,960
security

896
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,880
that's the consequence really does it

897
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,039
happen but this is why awareness

898
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,720
programs usually fail

899
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,080
because they fail to create the

900
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,399
consequences

901
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,200
that you need to really drive behavior

902
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,000
because the purpose

903
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,799
of an awareness program is to drive

904
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,840
positive security behaviors

905
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,679
so anyway let's move on to different

906
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,120
science different science

907
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,240
um counterterrorism in counterterrorism

908
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,520
one of the biggest things

909
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,480
is the concept of boom in cyber security

910
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,679
some people in the

911
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,600
out of the defense industry talk start

912
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,159
talking we gotta move left the boom

913
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,840
what is left of booming left the boom

914
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,520
really just means prevention

915
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,200
they want to focus more on prevention

916
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,720
but let me tell you

917
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,640
know what you know it's great to prevent

918
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,120
attacks as soon as you can

919
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,399
but you still have to plan for the

920
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,240
attacks in progress you still have to

921
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,559
plan for the reaction to the attacks

922
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,600
so let's talk about how this applies to

923
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,760
again the concept we're talking about of

924
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,279
human security

925
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,080
so talk a counter you know basically in

926
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,919
left boom you're doing things like

927
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,440
prevention protection you know and so on

928
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,200
and what that means is for example if

929
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,279
we're interested in stopping terrorists

930
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,279
prevention might be hunting down the

931
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,360
terrorists and trying to stop them

932
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,440
trying to stop the terrorists then you

933
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,880
have a different group of people who say

934
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,679
you know what

935
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,080
i have a facility my facility might be

936
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,520
under imminent attack

937
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,360
i'm going to figure out how to harden my

938
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,520
facility two different groups of people

939
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,039
working two different aspects of the

940
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:41,679
problem

941
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,480
then we have the concept of boom how do

942
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,399
we mitigate boom how do we go ahead and

943
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,039
stop

944
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,440
boom in progress and that might be for

945
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,080
example

946
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,799
in the case and and this is actually a

947
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,120
bit

948
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,159
of a security success story inside a bad

949
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:56,880
event

950
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,600
but you know 911 is iconic for the world

951
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,440
trade center but the pentagon will stay

952
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,720
at the same time

953
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,399
people remember the world trade center

954
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,000
better because that's where more people

955
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,080
died it's more visual and so on

956
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,840
ironically though the pentagon is a

957
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,279
bigger office building than the world

958
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,799
trade center was

959
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,799
but what happened was inside the

960
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,840
pentagon

961
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,600
in the months before they decided to

962
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,360
make it more bomb resistant

963
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,279
they put in bomb resistant walls they

964
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,039
put in more segment they put in more

965
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,640
metal to stop

966
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,519
imminent explosion damage and so on so

967
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,000
they were able to mitigate the attack

968
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,720
in progress they limited the damage then

969
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,320
you also have to plan for response

970
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,120
recovery

971
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,960
encounter terrorism and things like that

972
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,559
the response has to include

973
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,240
well let's make sure we have the

974
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,320
appropriate people in place like the

975
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,440
medical teams

976
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,880
but we also have to make sure the

977
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,559
medical teams are trained to respond

978
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,760
appropriately like

979
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,679
for example check for poison gas

980
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,760
radiation secondary bombs

981
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,240
and so on then there's a recovery you

982
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,000
know how do we get things up and running

983
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,440
again really quickly

984
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,279
and then resilience how do we get things

985
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,640
hard and how do we make sure this

986
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,399
doesn't happen again and so on

987
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,880
that's what happens in counterterrorism

988
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,480
now let me go on to another

989
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
concept that i think i'm the only person

990
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,919
that created but that's

991
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,200
user initiated loss and here's why i

992
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,039
call it user initiated loss

993
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,240
it's not user error and also the other

994
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,360
concept is

995
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,000
why do i call it initiative loss and

996
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,679
i'll start with that first

997
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,159
initiated loss if the user clicks does

998
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,120
something

999
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,679
they are initiating a potential chain of

1000
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:30,559
events

1001
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,640
they are not causing the dam they are

1002
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,159
not causing the loss they are not

1003
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,360
causing the damage

1004
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,840
they are initiating damage in other

1005
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,640
words if

1006
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,000
i click on a phishing message and that

1007
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,880
phishing message contains ransomware if

1008
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,080
for example

1009
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,440
there is anti-malware on the system

1010
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,679
the damage will be mitigated because and

1011
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,559
hopefully

1012
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,120
the system will not allow the user to

1013
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,039
implement malware on there

1014
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,559
if the user doesn't have permission to

1015
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,919
download software in the first place

1016
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,519
they don't have admin pillages

1017
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,679
it won't execute or most ransomware

1018
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:04,799
won't execute

1019
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,559
but anyway just because a user does

1020
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,919
something it doesn't mean loss is

1021
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:08,799
initiated

1022
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,720
if the user deletes the file the user

1023
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,480
isn't deleting the file

1024
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,559
the user is clicking an action telling

1025
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,559
the operating system i want the file

1026
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,279
deleted

1027
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,360
but the operating system can stop the

1028
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
file from being deleted

1029
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,880
so anyway they are just initiating the

1030
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,159
potential loss

1031
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,320
and that potential loss can be initiated

1032
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,399
either through ignorance carelessness

1033
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,679
malice any related issue it doesn't

1034
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,720
matter why

1035
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,360
because if i say user error i'm implying

1036
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,880
a motive

1037
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,279
or i'm implying a lack of mode but

1038
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,000
either way

1039
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,240
as a cyber security professional you

1040
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,519
should not care

1041
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,720
why an action was you know initiated

1042
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,399
you don't care what the reason is you

1043
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,960
just know a user has the ability to

1044
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,880
delete files a user has

1045
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,039
the potential ability to be conflict

1046
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,080
confronted

1047
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,960
with ransomware a user has the ability

1048
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,279
to

1049
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,399
send out data just because they have the

1050
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,039
ability

1051
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,240
it doesn't mean again you don't care why

1052
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,760
they're sending out a file with

1053
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,079
information at least not

1054
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,320
you know for the purposes of stopping it

1055
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,839
you might do that when you're trying to

1056
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,440
do an investigation after

1057
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,839
but you need to unjust understand you

1058
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,280
don't need to sign motive

1059
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,599
you just need to see they're initiating

1060
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,719
a loss

1061
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,399
and it doesn't mean the loss is going to

1062
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,639
be realized you want to mitigate the

1063
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,119
loss

1064
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,199
after it's initialized in other words

1065
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,399
you want to stop

1066
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,280
damage from happening so anyway in order

1067
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,359
to stop user initiated loss looking at

1068
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,399
left the boom

1069
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,239
first thing i recommend is preventing

1070
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,839
the user from being the position to

1071
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:40,800
initiate it

1072
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,199
in other words why is the user in the

1073
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:43,839
process

1074
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,760
in the first place does the user have to

1075
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,879
be in the process

1076
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,359
look at governance can we take the user

1077
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,199
out of the decision making loop

1078
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,000
can we stop the capability for example

1079
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,440
you know when you start looking at

1080
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,160
um you know help desk personnel a help

1081
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,240
desk personnel really needs to see

1082
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,400
the actual credit card if you don't give

1083
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,280
the person

1084
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,520
the credit card number to look at in

1085
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,200
their query screens

1086
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,960
they won't be able to steal it as an

1087
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,599
example so that's just one example

1088
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,079
but anyway also left the boom create a

1089
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,160
culture of consequences

1090
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,560
you know for user actions you know if

1091
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,240
everybody wears a badge

1092
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,400
everybody will wear a badge it doesn't

1093
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,920
matter whether you have an awareness

1094
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,640
program

1095
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,560
and let's say nobody wears a badge but

1096
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,400
you have a funny video that says well

1097
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,839
you should wear a badge nobody's going

1098
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:30,800
to wear a badge

1099
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,920
make sure you have the culture to do you

1100
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,520
know to make people do the things

1101
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,079
because

1102
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,920
everybody does the things that's the

1103
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,680
most secure way of doing it

1104
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,920
and users made in detection they may see

1105
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,599
something in the process and so on so

1106
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,960
that's great

1107
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,680
next more important is governance

1108
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,960
governance people

1109
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,000
so often overlook this concept in cyber

1110
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,839
security everybody looks as a set of

1111
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,280
documents like what you give to the

1112
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,160
auditors

1113
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,720
governance should say how a process is

1114
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,520
laid out

1115
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,240
what capabilities do users have what is

1116
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,560
the process that a user is or

1117
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,200
is not going to be a part of you know

1118
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,160
what are the

1119
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,079
actions by default and governance should

1120
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,520
then start to include

1121
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,680
if the user is to make an action how

1122
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,880
should they make that

1123
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,920
action that's a critical aspect

1124
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,160
governance really just says okay users

1125
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,200
will review

1126
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,520
emails and users should report but what

1127
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,960
does reviewing email mean

1128
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,040
you know you can't say a user stupid if

1129
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,800
you never gave them

1130
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,359
any way of actually doing it there's no

1131
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,040
such thing as common sense without

1132
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,160
common knowledge

1133
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,000
and you have to give people the common

1134
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,520
knowledge and common knowledge should be

1135
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,079
defined by governance

1136
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,240
anyway at the point of boom the user is

1137
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,560
prevented presented with the opportunity

1138
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,920
to initiate a loss

1139
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,599
and in this case what do they do do they

1140
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,079
detect it prevent it sound the alarm

1141
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,920
you know and you also have to consider

1142
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,160
what's the user experience

1143
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,079
are you guiding the user in the right

1144
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,960
direction a lot of emails

1145
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,119
servers today for example they will say

1146
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,240
this message

1147
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,800
originated from outside the network

1148
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,040
ideally they should say this link goes

1149
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,040
to the wrong pla you know does not go to

1150
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,480
where you think it goes

1151
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,280
and so on you know you can give people

1152
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,040
guidance and how to do it i'm using

1153
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,200
phishing as just an example but

1154
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,079
hopefully you

1155
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,480
can see or extrapolate how it can be

1156
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,880
used in other scenarios as well

1157
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,200
but remember the user is presented with

1158
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,960
the opportunity what do they do

1159
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,760
you know again carelessness willful you

1160
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,440
know so you have to figure it out

1161
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,280
now again this is where policies and

1162
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,960
governance comes in because i

1163
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,119
kind of look at most organizations are

1164
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,119
creating elmer fudds

1165
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,200
hopefully you all know who elmer fudd is

1166
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,960
if you don't i hate you

1167
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,599
but anyway elmer fudd is a disney cat uh

1168
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,599
not disney it's a warner brothers if you

1169
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,680
heard of bugs bunny again if you don't

1170
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,920
never heard of bugs bunny i hate you but

1171
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,520
anyway elmer fudd was always trying to

1172
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,079
hug

1173
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,800
hunt bugs bunny and what would happen is

1174
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
bugs bunny would hide from elmore fudd

1175
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,359
he would

1176
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,920
put on a dress he'd put on a wig he'd do

1177
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,560
something

1178
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,040
and elmer fudd could never recognize

1179
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,160
bugs bunny

1180
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,359
if he was in some sort of disguise

1181
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,359
and most cyber security awareness

1182
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,040
programs are creating

1183
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,920
elmer fudds they're basically saying

1184
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,599
watch out for that hacker

1185
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,440
those hackers are going to try to trick

1186
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,760
you they're going to try to do this

1187
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,599
and every time a user looks at an email

1188
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,920
message like is that a real message or

1189
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,800
is that a

1190
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,880
you know or is that those hackers that

1191
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,560
are social engineering

1192
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,400
you don't really care the user should

1193
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,000
not care

1194
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,520
at the end of the day the only thing the

1195
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,599
user should do is like hey i have this

1196
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,040
email message in here

1197
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,960
what is the appropriate way i should

1198
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,960
respond to this email message

1199
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,960
if it says it's from an executive if it

1200
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,640
says it's from a known party

1201
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,560
are they asking them to do things that

1202
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,920
are within you know

1203
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,960
the overall permissions that the user

1204
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,480
has things to do

1205
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,240
instead awareness programs are just

1206
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,720
relying upon watch out for that tricky

1207
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,440
hacker

1208
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,200
they're going to try to get it so now

1209
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,520
hopefully you train people now in

1210
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,079
write-a-boom the loss has been initiated

1211
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,720
does your environment expect it for

1212
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,400
example if users don't have admin

1213
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,160
privileges when a user clicks on

1214
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,480
a phishing message the user can't really

1215
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,839
damage the system

1216
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,599
they shouldn't be able to install

1217
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,200
malware from running

1218
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,960
if the user doesn't have permission to

1219
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,040
connect to certain outside systems they

1220
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,720
can't go ahead and do things

1221
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,560
does the system have for example data

1222
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,240
leak prevention in place so if a user

1223
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,920
sends out sensitive files

1224
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,839
are there web content filters that are

1225
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,000
looking for a user being enter

1226
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,119
credentials on some web system around

1227
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,560
you know so what you've got to do and

1228
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,880
write a boom planning for writing boom

1229
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,480
you have to figure out what are the

1230
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,599
actions a user can take

1231
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,400
and what how can you proactively

1232
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,839
determine what they are

1233
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,400
how can you proactively harden or making

1234
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,960
the system resilient to prepare for that

1235
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,720
inevitable harmful action

1236
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,960
and mitigate the harmful action you have

1237
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
to really think about that proactively

1238
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,079
and if you don't

1239
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,319
this is more important than a user

1240
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:07,839
clicking on a message

1241
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,440
because whether you use if the user

1242
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,800
clicks on a message through lack of

1243
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,560
awareness it doesn't matter

1244
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,160
according to the verizon data breach

1245
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,560
report you know or even going to more

1246
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,839
historical things

1247
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,160
three percent of people are sociopaths

1248
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,359
or psychopaths

1249
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,040
that three percent of your user

1250
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,640
population will do you

1251
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,680
harm if given the opportunity and it

1252
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,040
doesn't matter whether there's an

1253
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,480
awareness failing or not

1254
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,520
that will happen you have to anticipate

1255
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,480
the harm

1256
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,800
any user might cause and that's what

1257
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,520
accounting

1258
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,240
people have done throughout their entire

1259
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,000
you know throughout the hist well

1260
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,160
where they've got to these days most

1261
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,760
important if you have an incident go

1262
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,480
back

1263
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,400
why did the incident occur what caused

1264
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,839
it what enabled it

1265
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,240
you know proximity again is not the

1266
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,359
cause also

1267
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,440
i like to recommend i don't have it here

1268
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,640
but maybe you got

1269
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,920
lucky maybe there could have been more

1270
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,400
harm

1271
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,880
if the user got into a different system

1272
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,720
if the user somehow did something

1273
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,319
different or whatever

1274
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,160
maybe they caught the phishing message

1275
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,400
and it was caught in progress so near

1276
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,000
misses or something you also have to

1277
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,359
look for as well

1278
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,359
you know what caused it and how could it

1279
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,560
have been worse and what could you have

1280
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,319
done to make it better

1281
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,319
all this sounds difficult everybody says

1282
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,760
that's a lot of work i got to do this

1283
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,680
it's like well safety science does it

1284
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,880
accounting does it

1285
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,640
if there's an outage or some sort of

1286
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,240
issue in operations

1287
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,200
they look at it so anyway cyber security

1288
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,720
should be the same because cyber

1289
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,480
security is supposed to provide business

1290
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,119
but

1291
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,280
a business function and you've got to

1292
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,119
look at it as a business the same way

1293
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,480
everybody else does now when you think

1294
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,520
about it

1295
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,599
ninety percent of incidents result from

1296
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,400
some form of user initiated loss

1297
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,760
you know shouldn't that be part of your

1298
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,440
strategy you know that you can use for

1299
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,720
your organizations

1300
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,359
you know to currently analyze things or

1301
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,040
just slap counter measures around what i

1302
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,680
mean by this

1303
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,079
is right now the user problem as we

1304
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,760
refer to it normally

1305
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,599
the user problem is being handled by a

1306
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,440
set of independent tactics somebody says

1307
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,079
you know what

1308
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,640
i need kind of filtering messages for my

1309
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,119
i need filtering software for my email

1310
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,560
somebody says well we also need

1311
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,560
awareness and maybe phishing simulation

1312
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,480
so let's just do that

1313
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,520
somebody else might randomly say well i

1314
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,200
need data leak prevention i need

1315
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,400
anti-malware

1316
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
but nobody is looking at this as a

1317
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,440
strategy

1318
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,599
human security engineering should be

1319
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,599
considered as discipline

1320
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,079
that provides a strategic look at the

1321
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:32,720
human

1322
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,920
problem you know how does a user do this

1323
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,400
what are the steps from start to finish

1324
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,240
it's embarrassing

1325
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,400
every other business discipline looks at

1326
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,160
things as a process

1327
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,000
they look at the problem as from a

1328
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,800
strategic perspective in cyber security

1329
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,240
we're still looking at the user problem

1330
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,200
as a tactic as an awareness and yes you

1331
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:55,920
might need

1332
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,920
your awareness program might have a

1333
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,359
strategy of itself

1334
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,599
but it's just a strategy in the middle

1335
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,520
of an independent tactic

1336
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,760
you need a tactic for the bigger problem

1337
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,599
the bigger problem is user-initiated

1338
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:08,240
loss

1339
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,839
so if i'm going to go ahead and where

1340
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,000
well i don't know when tax season is

1341
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,599
anymore that kind of got lost in the

1342
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,000
process but let's just for example say

1343
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,160
a lot of businesses have the pro the

1344
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,680
problem around

1345
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,640
right now of sending out w-2 information

1346
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,800
actually it's more january time frame

1347
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,040
and it's a common fraud example where

1348
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,119
bad people look on linkedin and say

1349
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,000
hey who works in an hr department in you

1350
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,680
know mid-sized companies

1351
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,760
and then they send a message saying hey

1352
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,680
i'm the ceo of the company

1353
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,800
hey mr low-level hr person i need you to

1354
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,599
go ahead

1355
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,880
and send out all the wd2 information to

1356
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,760
our new accounting firm then what

1357
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,599
happens the people send it out

1358
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,760
happens to thousands of organizations

1359
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,760
every year from a human security

1360
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,440
engineering perspective how that should

1361
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,359
be done is we look at the problem okay

1362
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,680
well the problem coming in originates

1363
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,520
from some sort of phishing message

1364
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,800
for all for all security we have mail

1365
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,960
filtering going on strategically

1366
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,200
and if we're gonna let an email message

1367
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,440
through we're gonna tag it so maybe we

1368
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,319
tag it as an

1369
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,880
external message if you tag it as an

1370
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,640
external message then at least when the

1371
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,839
user looks at say

1372
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,560
hey why is the ceo coming in from an

1373
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,040
external account as an example

1374
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,520
and then the message says hey mr

1375
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,119
low-level person

1376
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,920
i need to go ahead and i need you to

1377
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,119
send this out

1378
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,280
now the low-level person should be

1379
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,280
saying hey is this one of those social

1380
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,839
engineers i saw in that awareness video

1381
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,720
or is this really the ceo that should

1382
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,000
not be the question

1383
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,079
a low-level person asks what the

1384
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,680
question should be is the

1385
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,640
question should be hey i am getting a

1386
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,280
message asking for the release of pii

1387
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,200
related information which w-2

1388
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,640
information is

1389
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,960
what is the process for release of w-2

1390
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,400
information the process

1391
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,520
is that hey i need to go ahead

1392
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,920
and all requests for pii needs to go to

1393
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,520
the head of human resources

1394
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,160
who then has to go the head of the then

1395
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,359
the general counsel

1396
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,839
and or the head of privacy and they have

1397
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:12,480
to review

1398
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,960
any release for pii so the low-level

1399
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,319
person shouldn't be sitting there

1400
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,319
thinking is this the bad guy or is this

1401
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:19,280
the ceo

1402
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,440
they should be thinking okay i need to

1403
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,599
forward this to the head of hr

1404
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,640
and then so be it and your awareness

1405
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,200
program should be a reinforcement of

1406
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,079
that process

1407
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,640
that's what awareness should be so

1408
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,280
anyway

1409
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,880
but let's say that fails because

1410
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,960
eventually it will fail no matter what

1411
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,000
maybe the

1412
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,800
social engineer will trick that general

1413
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,839
counsel

1414
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,680
you know congratulations to them if they

1415
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,920
do but whether they do or they don't the

1416
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,520
next thing that should happen is

1417
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,760
there should be like hey i'm going to

1418
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,839
send this data out and when you try to

1419
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,200
attach it somebody should say wait a

1420
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,640
second you're trying to attach

1421
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,960
pii do you really want to attach these

1422
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,800
files before you send it out

1423
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,880
and then the user says well this is the

1424
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,280
ceo that's not a tricky hacker

1425
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,599
and then when they hit send daily

1426
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,520
prevention software should stop it from

1427
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,760
going out but that's a holistic way

1428
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,240
of looking at this one problem but think

1429
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,280
of the overlap

1430
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,520
the whole guidance of handling pii is

1431
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,720
not just for this one

1432
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,920
scenario it's good for every you know

1433
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,880
all different scenarios involving pii

1434
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,720
data leak prevention stops a

1435
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,960
a whole lot of stuff filtering of

1436
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,880
incoming email tagging

1437
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,680
warning of attachments all that can stop

1438
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,520
a whole bunch of different types of

1439
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,240
losses

1440
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,200
either malicious or malignant in nature

1441
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,119
and again if you can mitigate 90

1442
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,640
of these counter measures just by

1443
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,319
stopping user initiated loss

1444
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,400
you're probably also going to stop even

1445
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,440
the things that don't

1446
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,160
involve the user as well awareness is

1447
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,839
still mandatory a lot of people say oh

1448
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,359
you seem to hate away no i

1449
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,680
awareness is critical but here's the

1450
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,560
concept awareness is not a silver bullet

1451
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,040
awareness should be what every other

1452
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,000
security

1453
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,960
tool is awareness is a form of risk

1454
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,000
reduction

1455
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,880
and when implemented well awareness will

1456
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,280
be

1457
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,160
a valid form of risk reduction just like

1458
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,839
all those anti-fishing

1459
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,560
anti-fishing filters that that failed in

1460
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,200
the process

1461
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,359
yes awareness will fail but you should

1462
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,680
have other processes in place to also

1463
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,680
verify and check this out

1464
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,960
but awareness is still critical anyway

1465
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,559
but more important are you throwing

1466
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,079
around a set of topics

1467
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,160
tactics or are you going to pursue a

1468
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,440
strategy

1469
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,079
you need to pursue a strategy like a

1470
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:34,720
science

1471
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,599
in mitigating user-initiated laws and

1472
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,200
safety science they call a science but

1473
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,000
let's call

1474
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,520
you know i call it human security

1475
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,800
engineering because it sounds more

1476
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,400
advanced

1477
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,240
social engineering sounds so much better

1478
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,240
than conning people which is essentially

1479
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,119
what it is

1480
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,359
so let's call human security engineering

1481
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,200
is a better way to handle the user

1482
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:53,839
problem

1483
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,599
but again the most important takeaway if

1484
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,200
you get nothing else out

1485
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,520
you know you're not trying to create

1486
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,960
healthier canaries

1487
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,040
you're trying to create a healthier

1488
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,119
system that stops the canaries from

1489
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,119
dying in the first place

1490
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,200
not going ahead and whether the canaries

1491
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,160
are strong

1492
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,240
whether they're weak whether they're old

1493
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,760
as long as they're not just dropping

1494
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,839
dead randomly from old age you want to

1495
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,520
keep them alive

1496
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,599
and the users again if they make an

1497
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,280
error it's a failure of your whole

1498
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,920
system even if it's outright malicious

1499
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,240
much like again the ceo of cloudflare

1500
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,079
said you know it's a failure of

1501
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,680
leadership if you're going to have a

1502
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,800
major problem

1503
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,680
and you're going to blame the user on it

1504
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,559
so

1505
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,960
anyway i have my new book you can stop

1506
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,839
stupid it

1507
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,319
it's awesome spash should have it as a

1508
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,920
coarse textbook

1509
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,400
hint i doubt it but have to at least

1510
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,839
throw it out there

1511
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,440
anyway available on amazon.com

1512
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,640
and that's how to reach me um

1513
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,118
any questions i think somebody came up

1514
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,680
what well i have no idea about the

1515
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,559
transcript anonymous attendee

1516
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,599
um okay reading gareb's message to my

1517
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:08,720
understanding trick

1518
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,000
um trade-off of using

1519
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,400
ability involved when making a system

1520
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,280
more secure

1521
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,119
you mentioned systematic changes no

1522
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,559
programs engineers

1523
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,760
would mitigate the effects

1524
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,359
okay for business how do you balance the

1525
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,599
two usability and security moving

1526
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:28,960
towards one

1527
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,680
it that's not necessarily let me arg let

1528
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,480
me contend

1529
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,280
and it's not i'm what i'm saying is not

1530
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,720
always correct

1531
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,000
but in general good security can create

1532
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,680
a better opera more efficient operating

1533
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,880
environment

1534
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,240
and yes security when done sometimes

1535
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,000
security will stand in the way of

1536
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,160
business processes for example it might

1537
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,240
make you might have a critical situation

1538
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:54,800
where

1539
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,000
you have to send a file to somebody

1540
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,480
that's critical you know for example you

1541
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,319
might be an engineer working inside a

1542
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:02,880
company

1543
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,920
and your email filters stop dot exe

1544
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,880
and you know tar files and other sorts

1545
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,440
of

1546
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,680
um you know data compression files from

1547
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,359
coming into your company

1548
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,480
so in general there i acknowledge that

1549
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,160
it can be the case

1550
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,480
but usually good security should make

1551
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,000
things more efficient

1552
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,160
it should speed up your network and so

1553
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,480
on so for example if your

1554
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,200
email filters are filtering out email

1555
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,400
messages

1556
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,839
well you're not going to go ahead

1557
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,160
and get a thousand messages in

1558
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,920
somebody's inbox that's all going to be

1559
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,040
filtered out

1560
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,160
you know there are cases with it um but

1561
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,240
you know you have to have a balance it

1562
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,280
should not be that

1563
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,720
security wins it should be like

1564
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,400
there's an expression i use security

1565
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,079
shouldn't be the department of no like

1566
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,119
it's perceived

1567
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,680
it should be the department of how and

1568
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,920
if you have a valid business function

1569
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,559
the job of a cso or anybody on the cyber

1570
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,400
security team should say okay

1571
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,960
i appreciate that we have a security

1572
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,160
concern i also

1573
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,559
appreciate more important that we have a

1574
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,119
business concern that we have to address

1575
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,599
so you should go ahead and proactively

1576
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,520
address the business case

1577
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,520
and make it better in all honesty these

1578
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,240
days a lot of security is ubiquitous

1579
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,280
and invisible to the user and we want to

1580
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,160
go ahead

1581
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,800
and continue that ubiquity we want to

1582
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,880
embed things into the process so for

1583
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,160
example

1584
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,160
you know i use accounting as an example

1585
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,440
because

1586
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,800
expense reports are a time sucker

1587
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,359
i've had expense reports that my filling

1588
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,200
out the expense report was longer than

1589
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,319
some of my trips

1590
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:48,480
but it's looked at as unnecessarily evil

1591
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,440
time cards time you know filling out

1592
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,440
your time and your reporting time

1593
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,280
reporting systems again

1594
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,599
is a critical business function nobody

1595
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:58,640
argues with that

1596
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,880
so again i would say try to be the

1597
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,160
department of how

1598
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,359
more than no consider usability

1599
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,599
but again if there you have to

1600
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:08,480
understand that

1601
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,800
security is likewise a critical business

1602
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,760
function

1603
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,599
and you have to try to address the

1604
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,680
usability but it's not

1605
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,640
necessarily always a balance of the two

1606
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,800
if you implement secure most

1607
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,240
most security well the usability

1608
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,119
might even be enhanced so i'll leave it

1609
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,000
at that

1610
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,839
are there any other questions

1611
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,760
well uh we'll wait here for another few

1612
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,960
minutes ira but you

1613
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,240
provided a durable fire hose of uh

1614
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,118
information there for us um so

1615
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,800
i i think people may maybe uh trying to

1616
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,480
let that soak in a little bit before

1617
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,079
coming up with something

1618
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,800
no i appreciate that i i will be honest

1619
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,119
i

1620
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,240
rarely do i get too many questions some

1621
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,119
people say i'm

1622
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,280
i might be intimidating some people just

1623
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,319
say i threw an

1624
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,480
entire encyclopedia because i think i

1625
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,400
covered at least five or six different

1626
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,119
fields

1627
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,760
in a single presentation in this case

1628
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,640
well i think

1629
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,319
i i think part of your point is good

1630
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,240
because i've been saying for a while

1631
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,280
um that security engineering we've

1632
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,240
we failed at a lot of it that looking at

1633
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,760
safety engineering

1634
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,440
may be better because however a failure

1635
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,800
occurs

1636
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,040
and we may not know the cause we want to

1637
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,960
prevent the bad effects

1638
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,640
and and so rephrasing the question

1639
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,680
is probably going to get us farther for

1640
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,960
some things

1641
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,920
and and that i realize it doesn't cover

1642
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,400
everything you talked about but uh

1643
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,400
we're in agreement on that part of it

1644
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,640
yeah because just to add to that

1645
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,800
here's the issue with safety science

1646
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,640
that we have failed because we don't

1647
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,839
have good

1648
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,160
return on investment studies in cyber

1649
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,280
security

1650
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,480
so in safety science if a user

1651
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,119
or sorry and not a user but if if an

1652
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:09,760
employee

1653
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,319
injures themselves on the job there are

1654
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:12,880
very

1655
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,079
very large potential losses incurred

1656
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,920
so if for example somebody

1657
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,160
well you know i have clients in the oil

1658
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,119
gas industry

1659
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,680
let's just say somebody accidentally

1660
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,200
blows up

1661
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,079
an oil processing facility hopefully

1662
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,680
that never happens

1663
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,520
but you know there are major losses

1664
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,559
if you'd have to take down a facility an

1665
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,000
operational unit there's like

1666
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,079
potentially millions of dollars a day

1667
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,040
to be lost if you have to shut down like

1668
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,480
you know like let's say you have like

1669
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,839
ford motor company

1670
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,520
they have you know like uh what they

1671
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,119
call it a factory line i

1672
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,599
forgot the tone but you know they they

1673
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:54,480
have the line

1674
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,079
shut down because somebody's injured

1675
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:57,920
that cost them millions

1676
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,400
so safety science there is a tangible

1677
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,280
measurement

1678
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,240
in the reduction of injuries and how

1679
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,000
much money that saves

1680
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,240
in cyber security we're suffering death

1681
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,680
by a thousand cuts

1682
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,040
and never adding it up properly so every

1683
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,799
time a user loses a usb

1684
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,960
drive yes there are the major incidents

1685
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,839
that happen

1686
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,680
but companies aren't looking at it at

1687
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,960
the micro level

1688
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,640
and if people would take the lesson from

1689
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,119
safety science and say wait a second

1690
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,119
there are lots and lots of losses we can

1691
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,960
mitigate if we look at it

1692
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,000
holistically with a strategy which is

1693
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,400
what safety science has reverted to

1694
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,640
and not just a set of tactics which is

1695
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,359
where we are with cyber security

1696
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,200
uh maybe then we'll begin to have the

1697
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,000
impact we want to have

1698
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,839
yeah well yeah some of the incidents

1699
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,280
that we have like

1700
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,720
the solar winds

1701
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,000
incident even even adding up what the

1702
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,680
costs are there's there's just no way to

1703
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,400
do that

1704
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,240
i think as you're talking about a

1705
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,000
petroleum plant

1706
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,520
very instructive in the literature is

1707
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,040
the terrible tragedy that occurred at

1708
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,559
bhopal

1709
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,480
um that put the company in bankruptcy as

1710
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,920
well as killing

1711
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,280
uh thousands of people and part of that

1712
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,960
land is still uninhabitable

1713
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,079
decades later um

1714
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,000
preventing those kinds of accidents in

1715
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,440
the physical realm

1716
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,520
we care about and we seem to have ways

1717
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,559
of measuring and

1718
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,079
testing we just don't apply them to

1719
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:27,920
software so

1720
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,799
your point is well made yeah and and we

1721
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:31,200
don't

1722
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,839
have to go into that because that really

1723
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,760
does require i mean that they had some

1724
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,799
of the best

1725
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:39,119
accounting minds in the you know in in

1726
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,880
the business figuring out what are the

1727
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,040
losses what are the benefits

1728
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,359
and we're not going to get those people

1729
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,520
to a large extent yeah we have some of

1730
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,359
it like the people in the solar

1731
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,160
solar winds are going to figure that out

1732
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,760
or maybe they won't they'll just say

1733
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,359
well we took a big hit

1734
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,839
ah let's go ahead we'll hire some people

1735
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:00,079
who sound famous and look good and we'll

1736
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,880
paint a happy face on our brand image

1737
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,480
and stuff like that

1738
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,400
but um in cyber security most companies

1739
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,520
don't sit there and

1740
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,160
actually calculate out the amount of

1741
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,720
loss they have but again more important

1742
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,359
they're not looking at it strategically

1743
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,440
everything is a set of tactics because

1744
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,040
there's no thought leadership

1745
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,680
we have the vendors telling us what to

1746
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,400
do

1747
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,839
and when we're dealing with the user

1748
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,440
every like you look at it

1749
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,160
every awareness company has said oh

1750
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,079
awareness is broken for the last

1751
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,400
three decades now and we have a better

1752
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,920
way to do awareness because our

1753
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,440
awareness is funny which they've been

1754
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,119
doing for three decades

1755
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,799
but no all but the vendors are driving

1756
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:44,960
the thought process we need ceo

1757
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,160
csos to step back and say

1758
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,440
here is how the thought process should

1759
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,079
be

1760
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,960
it is a it is a major problem that

1761
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,720
requires a strategy

1762
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,319
not just listening to vendors but

1763
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,799
looking at it in a systems perspective

1764
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,720
the way i look at every other the way

1765
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,920
every other department

1766
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,880
in the organization looks at themselves

1767
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,880
so ira we've got one more question in

1768
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,520
the q a and let's make this the last one

1769
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,760
uh and we'll finish up at this point so

1770
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,680
go ahead and give an answer to this

1771
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,160
okay what are my thoughts on the recent

1772
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,760
test the car crash where

1773
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,920
everybody was sleeping um

1774
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,079
it's unfortunate um

1775
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,240
when i look at that obviously that is a

1776
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,480
case that does tesla no good

1777
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,240
and tesla's going to go back and

1778
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,799
re-engineer their software to figure out

1779
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,720
where it happened why it happened where

1780
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,319
were the blind spots

1781
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:42,559
and tesla because they have so much at

1782
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,160
stake given the regulation and

1783
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,440
everything like that

1784
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,799
there's so much money involved um

1785
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:51,599
my thoughts are that a little bit so

1786
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,040
there are two thoughts and let me say it

1787
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,839
that way

1788
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:56,559
one is the bigger thing tesla is going

1789
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,079
to

1790
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,440
fix the problem the other problem though

1791
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:01,920
is

1792
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,920
are we just going to have people like

1793
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,760
when they first came up with the

1794
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,440
um cruise control there was a case where

1795
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,040
somebody had a motor home

1796
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,680
and he bought new brought a new motor

1797
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,319
home

1798
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,000
and then he gets on the highway puts it

1799
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
in cruise control and then he takes off

1800
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,160
his seat belt and walks to the back of

1801
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,000
the motor home thinking cruise control

1802
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,400
will

1803
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,119
let him keep going down the road didn't

1804
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,200
realize the limitations

1805
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,359
in this case there's going to have to be

1806
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,599
some sort of issues with this where tech

1807
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,119
where tesla's going to build in the

1808
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,960
safety functions because they don't want

1809
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,559
to be shut down

1810
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,119
so they have a billions of dollars on

1811
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,720
the line so they're going to solve that

1812
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,520
problem

1813
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,040
and they're going to have to for lack of

1814
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,880
a better term when i say stop being

1815
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,480
stupid in my book

1816
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,040
i'll just leave this thought stupid is

1817
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,760
not

1818
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,680
you're not going to stop a user from

1819
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,480
behaving in a stupid way

1820
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,440
however that doesn't mean you you're not

1821
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,520
responsible for stopping

1822
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,359
the impact of the stupidity

1823
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:05,119
and by not doing that you're the stupid

1824
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:07,040
ones but in this case tesla's going to

1825
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,400
have to go ahead

1826
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,440
and figure out how do we address this

1827
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,319
sort of problem

1828
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:14,000
are they going to put motion sensors

1829
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,319
inside the car to figure out if

1830
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:19,839
people are nodding off as as an example

1831
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,680
or something similar so that doesn't

1832
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,319
happen again but they have

1833
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,319
hundreds of billions in motivation to

1834
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,920
figure it out so i'm assuming they will

1835
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,880
well ira thank you so much for spending

1836
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:33,760
the time with us

1837
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,760
and we hope you can come back at some

1838
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,960
point where you're in person and

1839
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,000
actually get to

1840
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,599
meet some of the faculty and students

1841
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,880
close up

1842
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,200
yeah and people uh if you're interested

1843
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,640
in in more depth

1844
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,079
