1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,760
let me say welcome to all of our

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,799
participants

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,839
uh who are showing up for our

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,519
weekly serious security seminar

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,320
we've been holding this on a weekly

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,440
basis

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,480
since the early 1990s and

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,400
uh recording it for nearly 20 years

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,080
we've had quite a collection of speakers

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,760
but this is the first time

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,800
that wynn schwartah has been here to

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,240
grace us with

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,040
his ideas and his presence um

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,559
all of these talks are recorded and

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,840
they're available through the serious

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,440
website so you can

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,960
go back through time and listen to a lot

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,559
of other speakers or you can

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,160
replay this one again and again

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,039
wynn is well known in the security

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:49,680
community

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,960
for a lot of innovative thinking

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,719
and i think that's in part because he

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,120
didn't really have a background in

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,320
computing he approaches this from

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,199
a different perspective and as a result

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,400
he's been able to

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,640
discuss issues of things like

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,080
information warfare

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,119
cyber warfare but particularly some very

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,560
interesting ideas about

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
uh analog security and time-based

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,200
security

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,280
and uh we're looking forward to hearing

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
winds comments today

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,600
so uh during his talk if you have

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,560
questions

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,840
please post them in the q a and

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,640
uh we'll select from those to answer as

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,079
we go along

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,680
so without further ado uh the wonderful

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,560
mr schwartza please oh spaff thank you

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,159
thank you all very much

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,399
uh for coming what the i don't even know

45
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,759
what day this is

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,840
what day is this what month

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,680
somewhere all right well thank you all

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,200
for coming um

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,399
my job over the next uh few minutes

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,439
is to mess with your minds a little bit

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,320
and hopefully

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,960
just get you to think a little bit

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,759
differently

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,799
about approaches to security

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,160
as staff said i grew up differently and

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,399
i'll show you a little bit of that

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,959
and i think about things uh differently

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,800
than a lot of people

59
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,720
so what i'm gonna be talking about uh

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,840
is meant to hopefully help us reevaluate

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
where we're going in security

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,400
and perhaps get rid of some of the old

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,200
biases

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,119
that we've had for so many years

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,640
so i have a bunch of axioms that i like

66
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,959
to use feel free to read through them at

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,040
a later time but uh a couple of the

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,640
really important ones are about infinity

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,959
and we're going to get into the concept

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,319
of infinity

71
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,440
of why things have been failing why

72
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,760
security mechanisms aren't working and

73
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,879
it ends up being

74
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,480
fundamentally a a conceptual design

75
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,599
a framework that i argue

76
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,480
we need to improve upon now staff

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,760
mentioned that i come from

78
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,879
a slightly different world and i do

79
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,879
i grew up an engineer without a degree

80
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,920
so nothing there at all i was a hands-on

81
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,000
engineer my mother was the first audio

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,200
engineer at nbc during world war ii

83
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,120
and had uh went to the university of

84
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,120
michigan and all the broadcast stuff

85
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,840
such as the tech was back then my father

86
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,319
uh worked on radar development in the

87
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,920
pacific during world war

88
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,480
ii and then over on the right i started

89
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,959
a tv repair business at the age of five

90
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,480
because i was able to

91
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,519
change tubes and charge 50 cents for

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,760
every tv i fixed and so the world i grew

93
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,319
up in was

94
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,760
very different down at the lower left

95
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,319
there that's how we built stuff back in

96
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,680
the day you had to

97
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,560
go in there and sort through resistors

98
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,720
and capacitors and tubes

99
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,599
and sockets in order to make things work

100
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,439
and so it was a whole different kind of

101
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,239
diy

102
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,959
world back there and in the lower right

103
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,120
that was the first computer

104
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,959
uh i actually ever built and that was an

105
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,360
analog computer which uh

106
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,120
didn't really mean anything much to me

107
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,360
at the time but did many many years

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,720
later

109
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,120
so after my tv repair career

110
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,800
i ended up in

111
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,120
the music business and i it

112
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
was just something that happened i i

113
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
have i can think in systems

114
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,440
and so in the middle up there that is a

115
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,639
mechanical uh

116
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,560
electronic if you want to call it

117
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,759
cyberkinetic

118
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,840
uh lathe which is how we used to cut

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,800
records to make

120
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,440
vinyl on the left is a recording studio

121
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,880
that i helped build and i started

122
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,400
working there when i was 16

123
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
down at the bottom was another one and

124
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,639
over on the right i got to work at the

125
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,479
electric lady with hendricks and robert

126
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,080
margoloff on some of the early

127
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,639
mood stuff and this was all really

128
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,759
systems

129
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,000
where you had to kind of have a picture

130
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
of everything that was going on

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,400
to be able to either make it work or in

132
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,440
many cases

133
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,120
fix it especially in a live situation

134
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,880
which is where i spent a lot of many

135
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,520
years in that portion of my career

136
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,000
so i want to look at this from a

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,360
slightly different approach

138
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,680
and start talking about probabilistic

139
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,039
versus deterministic

140
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,400
views and we can go to physics

141
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,360
and in the classical newtonian sense

142
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,160
everything is

143
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,759
highly deterministic the pool ball

144
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,560
uh metaphor works very very well and

145
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,960
newtonian mechanics works very very well

146
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,840
determined

147
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,680
deterministically at certain scales and

148
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,479
generally they say macro scales but when

149
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,639
we start going down to the quantum world

150
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,360
everything is

151
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,680
suddenly very probabilistic

152
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,639
non-deterministic and we end up with

153
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,960
some very counter-intuitive

154
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,560
and counter physics

155
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
mechanisms that occur from time to time

156
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,240
down in the quantum foam

157
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,720
and those include very momentary

158
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,960
isolated cases of time travel

159
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,080
anti-entropic behavior that will occur

160
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,680
they occur at that level but are not

161
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,160
going to surface up into the macro level

162
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,720
but the principle is that we are

163
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,199
thinking

164
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,039
more and more and more in physics at the

165
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,120
pure probabilistic level

166
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,400
of all behavior in the universe in the

167
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,319
quantum world quantum is fundamentally

168
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,400
probabilistic as well

169
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,960
and the problem that we have obviously

170
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,039
is uh temperature control and the

171
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,080
massive amount of

172
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,000
errors that are in native to this

173
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,479
technology because of external influence

174
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,240
noise heat temperature all of those

175
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,360
kinds of

176
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,840
thermodynamic conditions that mess up

177
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,639
the quantum operations and make them

178
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,440
less than reliable one of the things to

179
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,560
keep in mind

180
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,520
is that when we're talking about quantum

181
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,360
computing being probabilistic

182
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,639
and we're going to see this in neural

183
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,120
networks is that very often

184
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,680
uh because the way they operate you ask

185
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,639
a question

186
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,520
give it some input and you expect some

187
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,199
in a deterministic mindset

188
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,080
and output of a given answer but in many

189
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,440
of the worlds we're going to be talking

190
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,880
about that's just not true you're going

191
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,440
to get

192
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,599
potentially different answers over a

193
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,120
period of time

194
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,520
as the nature of the network that's

195
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,960
making the decisions

196
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,000
the computer if you will or evolves over

197
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,599
time now purdue has been i spelled it

198
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,520
right there for you spaff

199
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,080
uh purdue has been involved in

200
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,759
probabilistic computing

201
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,000
trying to overcome some of the native

202
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,240
problems that quantum computing has and

203
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,520
again it's all probab

204
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,639
probabilistic and the math is pretty

205
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,680
well known

206
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,560
however in this case uh it what they're

207
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,080
working on with and i forget the name of

208
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,199
the japanese

209
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,720
organization that you're researching

210
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,800
with that they can operate at room

211
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,720
temperature and they're scalable

212
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,440
and because of that and the way that

213
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,280
they work you could have two to three

214
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,479
order magnitudes

215
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,120
less computing power required for a

216
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,840
given operation now this is not a

217
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,319
replacement

218
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,759
for quantum computing but it's an

219
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,000
interim step that has been found to be

220
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,960
able to solve

221
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,360
a certain subclass of quantum computing

222
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,160
problems

223
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,240
taking this approach and again we're

224
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,639
back into the probabilistic world

225
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,759
brain probabilistic uh forgotten

226
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,560
memories

227
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,120
uh influenced memories the feedback

228
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,880
mechanisms that occur

229
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,679
it's all about the brain doing averaging

230
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,000
and

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,640
waiting and looking at input conditions

232
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,000
and coming up with

233
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,360
some sort of polled answer

234
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,440
some sort of weighted answer that is

235
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,040
going to be probabilistically

236
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,000
maybe uh it's going to be the best guess

237
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,080
and that's just the way the brain

238
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,720
works uh it is much more of a stochastic

239
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,279
kind of

240
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,399
processing than traditional uh

241
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,080
computers and that's just part of the

242
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,680
problems that we've had if you've had a

243
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,560
a chance to read jeff hawkins work on

244
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760
the thousand

245
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,279
uh brain uh model that we have in our

246
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:09,680
heads

247
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
according to him it becomes exceedingly

248
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,399
interesting when we have 150

249
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,760
000 roughly parallel computing neural

250
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,560
computing elements in our neocortex

251
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
so everything around us is going

252
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,760
probabilistic

253
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,680
and when we look at neural networks it's

254
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,120
about waiting it's about

255
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,880
averaging it's about coming up with some

256
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,640
an initial best guess

257
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,839
and then letting whether it's uh self

258
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,640
training

259
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,040
uh with data sets training without data

260
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,839
sets

261
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,519
whether no matter which way we go

262
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,680
they're still going to be

263
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,320
answers that are not going to be perfect

264
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,760
at all and this is what makes it

265
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,120
probabilistic

266
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,279
so in deep learning uh with

267
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,360
convolutional neural networks it's

268
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,240
all about hidden layers averaging

269
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,320
feedback mechanisms

270
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,760
and coming up with the best guess

271
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,279
and we see a lot of the errors that are

272
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,600
occurring in facial recognition is one

273
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,480
that has been a

274
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,800
 and it still is and so in some

275
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,880
cases these things work exceedingly well

276
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,800
when you're looking for patterns

277
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,959
and an unknown answer and looking for

278
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,720
insights with data and statistical

279
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,600
analysis

280
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,160
but when it comes to absolute one and

281
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,640
zero

282
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,839
binary conditions no and so i'm arguing

283
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,880
against

284
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,760
insecurity having strict binary

285
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,480
conditions of the zero and ones i think

286
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,839
they have really hurt us

287
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,880
over time now just to clarify here we

288
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,560
have a

289
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,640
couple computers now the one on the

290
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,760
right uh

291
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,920
obviously uh maybe some of you have seen

292
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,200
some of the uh

293
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,959
videos on youtube of uh asian students

294
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,600
using abba chi and then doing the abacus

295
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,640
calculations just using their fingers

296
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,440
at incredible rates of speed now in this

297
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,839
case

298
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,120
uh there's 13 columns so we're good to

299
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,240
13 decimal points

300
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,839
now on the analog one on the left well

301
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,680
are we going to get to 13 decimal points

302
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,640
no we're going to get to an

303
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,079
approximation

304
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,920
and that is good enough it was good

305
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,600
enough to get us to the moon it was good

306
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,000
enough

307
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,800
to get us uh nuclear weapon designs it

308
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,399
has been good was good enough

309
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,200
in the 1930s 40s for all of the work

310
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
that had led to

311
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,519
pre-digital work that's how it was done

312
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,000
and

313
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,560
it was good enough so part of what we

314
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,000
have to keep in our mind as we're

315
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,720
looking at

316
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,800
alternative ways of security is what is

317
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,000
good enough and that's going to come

318
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,680
into risk and trust

319
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,600
uh the antikythera machine on the left

320
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,519
clearly an analog device of

321
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,959
some degree of precision and then

322
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,720
the enigma on the right clearly a

323
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,079
digital one for one

324
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,320
binary relationship between input and

325
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,839
output

326
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,959
and back in the day uh the big machine

327
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,600
on the left

328
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,920
that's a guidance system and on the

329
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,120
right that was in

330
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,320
the early eniac so we had both

331
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,440
technologies uh in parallel

332
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,240
until roughly the early 1970s when

333
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,320
digital cost of transistors had gone

334
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,440
down by

335
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,399
i've got nine orders of magnitude and it

336
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,320
became the way to go

337
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,560
not saying it's right for security

338
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,800
analog computers

339
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,680
offer uh some advantage if you're

340
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,079
willing to live with a little bit less

341
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,680
precision if you don't need

342
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,240
10 decimal points 12 decimal points or 6

343
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,320
or whatever the resolution is of your

344
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,880
analog versus digital world

345
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,920
one of the advantages is speed

346
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,480
lack much lower power consumption much

347
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,760
more eco-friendly

348
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,480
and you can interface with the outside

349
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,760
world the physical world

350
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,279
much easier because you're already

351
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,200
operating with sensors

352
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,880
in a analog domain plus

353
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,040
we don't have as much noise that gets

354
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,320
involved in the system we're not going

355
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,160
to have adac quantization

356
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,360
noise that's going to be occurring so

357
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,800
we're going to have much more pure

358
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,680
signals

359
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,560
again this is all within the analog

360
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,279
realm

361
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,600
and the analog realm says i have a

362
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,360
minimum i have a maximum and

363
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,519
everything is gone to all of my answers

364
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,279
everything is going to be somewhere in

365
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,000
the middle it's not going to be a zero

366
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,320
and it's not going to be a one it's

367
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,920
never going to be perfect

368
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,519
and as long as we can start thinking

369
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,519
that way we can arrive at some answers

370
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,000
that are a little bit different

371
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,120
so the premises of the security it's not

372
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,560
working i'm not going to go down that

373
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,519
the next generation stuff we see in rsa

374
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,839
that's not going to do much digital is

375
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,040
not binary

376
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,480
this binary mindset that we see so much

377
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,839
especially today it's an

378
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,480
either or condition and i have always

379
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,839
been a huge fan because of my analog

380
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,560
growing up in engineering of spectrums

381
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,720
of light it's a spectrum the visible

382
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,760
light spectrum

383
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,800
uh the electromagnetic spectrum dc to

384
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,720
light whatever phrase you want to use

385
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,639
these are spectrums the autism

386
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,600
spectrum it's not a binary condition and

387
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,120
when we look at things as simple

388
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,160
politically

389
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,800
as a minimum wage congress will say oh

390
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,600
we're going to make it

391
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,199
10 but where is the dynamics involved in

392
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,839
that

393
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,480
in order to have it evolved without

394
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,000
having to have another huge

395
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,399
pissing match in five or ten years why

396
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,000
not create a dynamic

397
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,760
analog for that so the survival

398
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,279
mechanism and part of the problem that

399
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,120
we have with our current networks and

400
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,800
network security models is that

401
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,920
the adaptability to change uh

402
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,399
is not really there we have built these

403
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,440
binary

404
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,160
fortress mentality walls around things

405
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,720
and we're

406
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,519
sort of stuck right there and as you

407
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,240
will see

408
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,399
the really bad word is infinity

409
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,600
so if you remember the old joke

410
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,920
uh there's two guys out hunting and

411
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,639
suddenly

412
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,760
and they're together and suddenly

413
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,839
there's a bear and one guy starts

414
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,240
running

415
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,680
the other guy sits down on a rock and he

416
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,320
takes off his hunting shoes and starts

417
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,560
to put on his nikes and the first guy is

418
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,839
running away says what are you doing

419
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,959
what are you doing

420
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,880
you can't you're not gonna outrun the

421
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,079
bear and he goes

422
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,399
i don't need to outrun the bear i just

423
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,519
have to outrun

424
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,519
you and this is again an example of the

425
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:19,839
min

426
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,880
max conditions of survivability that

427
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,279
exist

428
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,320
in the real world that i argue should be

429
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,040
viewed as how we do things in uh the

430
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,959
world of security

431
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,199
so some of the things uh the the

432
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,720
philosophies that i i

433
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,920
talk about is creating dynamics making

434
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,720
sure

435
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,680
that we're not having absolute static

436
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,040
answers to things

437
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
and one of the ways to do that as i'll

438
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,320
show you in a bit is by introducing

439
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,880
various types of feedback mechanisms

440
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,440
and out-of-band communications uh we're

441
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,560
not going to get into too much of

442
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
negative time today but it's another one

443
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,800
of the elements that can be introduced

444
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,040
into analog security and analog

445
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,079
processing

446
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,880
when we're trying to approach uh one

447
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,000
which is 100

448
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
security which will never be achievable

449
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,120
of course

450
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,000
so the whole thing all of these pieces

451
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,759
the one common metric between them all

452
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,120
is time

453
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,160
and time is allows us to have that

454
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,880
uh dynamic and if you look at again

455
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,000
quantum mechanics

456
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,720
unless there is a relationship between a

457
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,519
and b

458
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,839
and there is some relative motion or

459
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,639
relative

460
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,519
activity going on between them there is

461
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,519
no activity there is no progress

462
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,079
at all so therefore we cannot live in

463
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,079
the world of stasis we have to keep

464
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,920
things dynamically going

465
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,079
and this goes back uh staff reference

466
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:40,959
that

467
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,040
uh time back based security and this was

468
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,759
uh some work that we did in the late 90s

469
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,519
and fundamentally it says

470
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,920
i should be able to know the detection

471
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,560
time of a given thing so

472
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,759
if we think of a jewelry store and there

473
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,160
are alarm systems and windows and all

474
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,880
that

475
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,600
if i break the window how long does it

476
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,079
take

477
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,559
the alarm system to detect that

478
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,720
something bad has happened

479
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,760
that's detection time then we have rt

480
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,039
reaction time what is the mitigating

481
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,199
action and in that case it's probably a

482
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,520
call to the police send them all

483
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,599
now the bad guys are going to know if

484
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,280
they've done their job right how long

485
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,640
it takes the police normally to be able

486
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,400
to respond

487
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,559
so therefore in this case we have a dt

488
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,720
detection time plus reaction time equals

489
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
exposure time and that exposure time

490
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,640
is how long the bad guys have to be able

491
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,120
to steal as much jewelry as they can

492
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,039
with whatever buffer time they think is

493
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,120
appropriate prior to the police if

494
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,160
they're on time

495
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,960
coming to get them that's all great and

496
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,799
that makes things pretty simple

497
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,080
now where the problem is for our world

498
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,280
is vendors and it's pt

499
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,480
protection time or defense time when you

500
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,320
talk to a vendor and you say hey

501
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,919
uh how long can you're

502
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,480
picking on a firewall defend against the

503
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,799
entire chinese cyber army before it

504
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,960
collapses does anybody know that answer

505
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,960
no uh is your uh are you gonna guarantee

506
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
your defensive product whatever kind of

507
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,320
defensive protective uh

508
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,240
product you have are you gonna guarantee

509
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,520
it no

510
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,799
it doesn't happen when we look at

511
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,039
the efficacy of products that are out

512
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,000
there

513
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,039
having a deterministic value of what

514
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,480
that protection mechanism is is not

515
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,640
forthcoming right now in our industry so

516
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,799
i can label it indeterminate it could be

517
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,120
really good it could be really bad

518
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,280
it could be completely configured

519
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,160
properly

520
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,320
or it could be completely misconfigured

521
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,880
with massive holes in it again a dynamic

522
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,440
process

523
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,360
and we do not know the answer because

524
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,880
the only way to know the answer

525
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,080
is to go in and look and we're not doing

526
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,320
a whole hell of a lot of that right now

527
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,679
so the goal assuming that we don't know

528
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,799
what the value of protection is from any

529
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,240
protective mechanism

530
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,720
process in any of our networking and

531
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,320
this is good for human

532
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,799
kinetic or cyber the principle is the

533
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,679
same

534
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,360
the goal is because i don't know pt

535
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,679
is to make my detection of reaction time

536
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,880
shrink and approach

537
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,960
zero it's a simple limit function i want

538
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,280
to get those periods of time

539
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,080
as short as possible because that also

540
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
reduces my exposure time

541
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,480
which means that the bad guys of the

542
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,520
jewelry store

543
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,080
uh how much can they steal in one second

544
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,320
uh versus how much can they steal

545
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,080
in a hundred seconds or a thousand

546
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,160
seconds there is some numbers there if

547
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,720
we choose to look at it that way

548
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
now this gets much more interesting when

549
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,559
we look at data exfiltration in the

550
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,480
network at that bottom formula

551
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,160
because suddenly bandwidth becomes

552
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,919
interesting as well because bandwidth is

553
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,600
another time function

554
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,799
so how much data can be extricated

555
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,840
in what period of time based upon

556
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,039
what bandwidths are are part of the

557
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,000
exfiltration

558
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,360
pathing do we know that answer well we

559
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,440
should be able to analyze that answer

560
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,760
and have some idea of what's going on

561
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,440
but this is the basis of time-based

562
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,679
security is that we want

563
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,520
detection of reaction to approach zero

564
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,360
minimize exposure time

565
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,679
under the auspice that we do not know

566
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,200
for sure

567
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,039
how good the protective mechanisms are

568
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,080
so part of and i apologize why some of

569
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,600
these

570
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,480
pictures are because i swapped machines

571
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,039
is why

572
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,559
i'm sorry is putting

573
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,360
feedback into mechanisms is

574
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,159
one of the ways that i see of being able

575
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,919
to actually apply

576
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,039
quantitative analog trust and risk

577
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,960
into the design of the security are

578
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,080
networks so

579
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,159
if you look at the uh picture with the

580
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,280
brass there that

581
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,840
is a mechanical governor and the purpose

582
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
of that mechanical governor is

583
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,760
to keep trains from not going too fast

584
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
and so the pressure at the bottom coming

585
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,039
from the steam engine would

586
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,520
force those balls to go out and it was

587
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,240
encased in a cylindrical tube

588
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,320
and therefore the phrase balls to the

589
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,960
wall meant that your train was really

590
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,840
going fast

591
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,679
forcing the balls to the wall which was

592
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,440
the feedback mechanism

593
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,919
in order to try to slow it down a little

594
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:30,720
bit

595
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,559
otherwise you have a runaway condition

596
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,960
and a runaway condition is

597
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,000
an attempt to reach infinity now we have

598
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,679
the same thing over here

599
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,840
on on an electrical oh my bad

600
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,080
there we go sorry uh we have the

601
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,360
electrical condition

602
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,520
every single electronic circuit in the

603
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,720
world uses

604
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,400
feedback the reason it uses feedback

605
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,640
is that without negative feedback you're

606
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,240
going to have runaway conditions

607
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,280
electrically

608
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,520
period end of story again approaching

609
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
infinity as we see in the acoustic world

610
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,039
down there we've all seen

611
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,039
speakers and microphones and they start

612
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,080
squealing

613
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,720
that is an attempt of that system to

614
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,880
reach infinity so

615
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,679
without the negative feedback we are

616
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,760
going to have a self-reinforcing

617
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,799
network that will cause bad things to

618
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,679
happen

619
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,039
so all of this is about how do i control

620
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,440
an analog system and it's been done for

621
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,039
a long time

622
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,720
in the scada ics world uh we have this

623
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,559
we have the mindset

624
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,960
how high should the water go uh how low

625
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,799
can the water go what temperature can

626
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,520
the water be

627
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,840
what pressure can i have in the system

628
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,200
and these are all

629
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,840
cyberkinetic interconnections in order

630
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,559
to

631
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,919
make systems work within tolerable

632
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,880
limits

633
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,440
again min max conditions what are the

634
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
tolerable limits of a particular system

635
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,200
that i can live with

636
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,679
that are good enough for my particular

637
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,640
application

638
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,960
without attempting to go completely

639
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,559
binary

640
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,120
so we have these all around us we live

641
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,760
with them

642
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,640
every single day and we're going to see

643
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,240
more and more of them

644
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,360
excuse me in the coming years as

645
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,200
various types of neural networks and

646
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,880
quote-unquote intelligence starts

647
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,320
reaching out into more consumer products

648
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,159
now when we take the concept of feedback

649
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,679
i want to introduce this concept to

650
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,679
buddha and this was introduced by

651
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,559
colonel john boyd in 1984 at montgomery

652
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,520
air force base

653
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,039
in alabama and he was a combat

654
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,159
pilot and he theorized what is the best

655
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,200
way

656
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,559
for me to survive and win in a dog fight

657
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,159
and the answer was an ooda loop

658
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,919
and his premise was the first portion is

659
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,080
as a fighter pilot observed now that

660
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,240
could be through his sensors

661
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,880
biosensors it could be through the

662
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,520
sensors

663
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,200
in the airplane itself some combination

664
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,520
of these create an observable frame of

665
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,720
reference

666
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,240
once you have that then you have to

667
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,720
orient how do you how do you fit inside

668
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,320
this frame of reference

669
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,320
with regards to the static items and

670
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,000
then the dynamic items which

671
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,960
is going to be your adversary so you've

672
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,880
got the orientation and then

673
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,320
you have to make a decision what are you

674
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,360
going to do you're going to pull to the

675
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,559
left pull to the right you're going to

676
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,120
shoot

677
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,200
what are you going to do and that's all

678
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,640
based upon your observation and

679
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,080
orientation once the decision

680
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,640
is made then you act and then you get to

681
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,200
do it

682
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,039
all over again assuming you haven't been

683
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,720
shot down hopefully

684
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,960
so the ooda loop is a process

685
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,919
and it's a process of control uh we use

686
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:46,960
the same thing

687
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,080
in uh marketing uh i got an idea for a

688
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,039
product

689
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,799
well let me do a little bit of research

690
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,720
and see what people think of me

691
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,159
building a whole new green furry things

692
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,840
and i do market research turns out

693
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,520
people really want green

694
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,960
furry things i've done it all i've

695
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,720
oriented it to

696
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,159
my satisfaction that it's worth a

697
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,080
million dollars to invest i make the

698
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,919
decision to do that we start

699
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,919
manufacturing them and distributing them

700
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,200
under act

701
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
they go out there and now i get to do

702
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,039
more market research and find out god

703
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,640
people didn't want grain furry things

704
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,400
they want red furry things

705
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,159
and i have to go through this whole loop

706
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,400
all over again and the goal is in

707
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,960
marketing especially it's very obvious

708
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,200
i want to do that faster than my

709
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,159
competitor

710
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,679
because if i can react to market

711
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,840
conditions and come out

712
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,919
with what the market demands faster than

713
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,279
my competitor

714
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,120
i have a better chance of winning and

715
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,200
this was boyd's principle

716
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,240
and his whole point about dog fighting

717
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,360
he wants his ooda loop

718
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,960
to be faster than his adversary's

719
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,320
ooda loop because if you are faster and

720
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,679
inside of your adversary zooto loop you

721
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,720
will win the battle and that has been

722
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,600
his argument

723
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,760
and it makes so much sense when we start

724
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,919
looking at any dynamic system whatsoever

725
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,080
we can get really complex if we choose

726
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,840
there's all sorts of levels and we see

727
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840
more of this as it applies into networks

728
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,559
as well

729
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,159
uh one of the cases where positive

730
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,000
feedback is good and i just want to make

731
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,760
sure that uh is there is when it comes

732
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,880
to learning

733
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,440
because the learning in the neurals of

734
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,159
our bio

735
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,799
of the of the wet wear up here is very

736
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,720
similar to the learning mechanisms that

737
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,159
we're attempting to do

738
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,440
with uh digital circuits with electronic

739
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,240
circuits and

740
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,880
emulating them in various other uh

741
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,400
artificial environments

742
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,039
so positive feedback does have

743
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,200
mechanisms and it also it tends to be

744
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,240
more in the bio

745
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,960
area and if you look at life and growth

746
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,279
and

747
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,760
forest and all of that positive feedback

748
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,360
is exceedingly important

749
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,520
but for our purposes we want negative

750
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,240
feedback in the process

751
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,159
now let's take this and apply it a

752
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,360
little bit more to

753
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,480
our networks about trust and i certainly

754
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:02,960
have

755
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,480
trust issues do i trust

756
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,080
anybody 100

757
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,000
do you trust anybody 100

758
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
do you trust your spouse and your gut

759
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,440
reaction may be

760
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,279
uh yeah i trust my spouse i've asked

761
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,799
audiences about this all around the

762
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,520
world

763
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,799
and they go yeah yeah and i said all

764
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,399
right so you trust your spouse 100 with

765
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,679
your life angel yeah

766
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,360
and i said what if your children

767
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,919
were in danger would your wife your

768
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,520
spouse pick

769
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,679
the children or you he goes yeah but

770
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,919
that's i said yeah but that's an analog

771
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:38,799
case

772
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,520
it is not binary because none of us know

773
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,000
for sure how we're going to react in any

774
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,760
situation

775
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,320
now when it comes to in this case uh

776
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,559
hiring people inside of an organization

777
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,840
and i'm not going to go down to code i'm

778
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,080
going to talk about people here

779
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,559
when we hire people the hr departments

780
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,520
typically are

781
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,640
so clueless as to what's important

782
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,120
and so i i got together with some uh

783
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
friends that staff and i all know

784
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
and said give me some ideas give me some

785
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,360
balance on what sort of criteria you're

786
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,559
interested in

787
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,240
when hiring somebody for a reasonably

788
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,799
uh important mission critical if uh

789
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,760
necessary

790
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,399
uh security position and these are the

791
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,799
sorts of numbers but each one then has a

792
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,000
waiting factor

793
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,480
i really really care about his technical

794
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,440
competence yep

795
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,279
matters a whole lot and i'm going to

796
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,840
give it a waiting factor of 75

797
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,000
because it is that important to me and

798
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,840
so we have all of these

799
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,960
uh numbers that we're kind of guessing

800
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,039
we're kind of giving it a first pass

801
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,440
guess to be able to come at

802
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,880
uh arrive at a an approximate

803
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,000
comfortable trust level versus risk

804
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
because risk comes as a result

805
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,440
of trust or non-trust and so we can go

806
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,679
through all of the waiting factors

807
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,320
but keep in mind that waiting factors as

808
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,360
i'll show you in a little bit

809
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,159
also change over time these are not

810
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:04,880
static

811
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,320
that's what happened to alder james

812
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,919
that's what happened to hanson

813
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,240
nobody ever re-vetted them it was like

814
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,840
okay you're cool you're cool we're going

815
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,200
to ignore the million dollars we're

816
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,480
going to ignore all this stuff or we

817
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,080
never even noticed it

818
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,120
and this gets into what i'll show you

819
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,960
later is detection and depth which is

820
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,360
that periodic trust reevaluation

821
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,200
that can only be done through various

822
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,640
types of

823
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,039
detection mechanisms and again we end up

824
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,720
with trust factors sitting somewhere

825
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,000
between

826
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,039
zero and one it's never going to be

827
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,360
absolutely perfect

828
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,039
so let's uh take a look at the two-man

829
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,720
rule and i want to concentrate on humans

830
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,559
because it makes it easier here

831
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,320
uh typically you've got in any uh uh

832
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,440
environment some number uh greater than

833
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,080
one

834
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,919
of people that have administrative

835
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,679
control over

836
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,760
all or pieces of the elements of your

837
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,720
network

838
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,600
cool now what happens when you have in

839
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,240
this case

840
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,200
two people that have control over a

841
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,799
particular portion of the network now

842
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,799
alice and bob here could be code

843
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,480
it could be process but it's easier to

844
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,919
think of it as humans

845
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,480
so let's say through our uh trust

846
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,240
evaluation we're going to say

847
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,360
both bob and alice have a trust level of

848
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,559
0.9

849
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,159
and that's going to work within my

850
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,600
organization that may not be

851
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,440
translatable to bank of america or the

852
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,960
government or any other environment but

853
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,520
it's

854
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,200
my self-contained universe that i've

855
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,559
come up with these numbers

856
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,279
to have some level of consistency what

857
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,000
happens

858
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,480
if i now give them both the rights what

859
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,000
ends up happening

860
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,320
is that because of probable probability

861
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,399
and i'll show you how this works

862
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,360
our overall trust factor decreases from

863
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,640
0.9 to 0.81

864
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,760
and this is pure probabilistic view of

865
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,960
how risk and trust work in

866
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,919
any network whatsoever so using an or

867
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:58,559
gate

868
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,600
in this case is going to absolutely

869
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,519
degrade the performance

870
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,320
uh or my mama the uh my confidence in my

871
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,279
security

872
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,760
so let's look at it another way now

873
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,600
we've got four people

874
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,120
all with or equal value of

875
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,159
uh trust they're all point nines what

876
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,440
happens

877
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,320
suddenly there's the math suddenly the

878
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
overall trust that i can apply to that

879
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
particular portion of my network

880
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,919
goes way the hell down so

881
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,919
the math is there it's pretty straight

882
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,080
ahead but this isn't the solution that

883
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,519
i'm looking for

884
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,960
so the two-man rule says

885
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,480
i want both bob and alice to confirm

886
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,799
an action whatever that action is

887
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,720
whatever that decision is

888
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,840
so when we do that we've got a different

889
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,440
equation that comes up

890
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,399
and it comes out when bob and alice both

891
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:55,120
approve

892
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,480
that particular action our trust factor

893
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,200
has suddenly increased substantially

894
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,360
and there's the digital equivalent in a

895
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,600
switching network the problem is time

896
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,080
how long does it take bob to verify

897
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,360
alice

898
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,720
it could take a minute it could take

899
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,480
a weekend it could take some period of

900
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,840
time in

901
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,679
processes and code then it's in a

902
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,120
different set of equations

903
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,600
but the principle is still the same so

904
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,799
in this case this is

905
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,640
what we're seeing here is just not going

906
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,840
to work

907
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,919
and this is the way my wife's car works

908
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,519
so take a look at this it's pretty

909
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,360
straight ahead she has one of those auto

910
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,960
sensing cars and so you're driving along

911
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,880
and you want to change lanes now in the

912
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,080
old days

913
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,200
what i would do is i do this

914
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,519
flip the thing maybe double check if i'm

915
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,600
a good driver or if it's really crowded

916
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,320
before i change lanes now with these

917
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,679
auto sensing cars

918
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,960
there's an increase in

919
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,519
uh a tendency for people to trust the

920
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,120
technology

921
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,640
and i know a lot of us don't like that

922
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,480
phrase so

923
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,360
what my wife's car does she clicks to

924
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,000
turn

925
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,279
uh switch lanes put on the blinker that

926
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,640
activates all these sensors and

927
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,080
do you trust it do i just

928
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,480
change lanes because the computer and

929
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,960
the car says it's safe

930
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,000
or do i

931
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,399
do this anyway as a verification

932
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,080
that there's not a porsche coming down

933
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,399
at 200 miles an hour and the next lane

934
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,200
gonna

935
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,080
hit me because the sensors are only good

936
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,640
for 50 meters

937
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,600
what do i do well in this case how much

938
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,320
time

939
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,919
do you need to do that double

940
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,080
verification

941
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,960
before you actually change lanes and

942
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,720
this is the principle of what is called

943
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,799
a time time-based flip-flop

944
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,600
which is the basis of all analog

945
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,039
security

946
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,159
and what you see down there uh in the

947
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,120
uh sorry in the upper right is a an

948
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,760
abstract

949
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,120
version of how decision matrixes are

950
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,840
done

951
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,800
uh regardless of what the environment is

952
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,320
but down in the

953
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,879
lower right this is the time based

954
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,599
flip-flop

955
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,719
which basically says alice is going to

956
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,320
make a decision

957
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,119
policy company policy is going to give

958
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,320
bob

959
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,399
one minute one day some period of policy

960
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,918
driven time

961
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,480
to approve or disapprove alice's choice

962
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,520
however if bob does not react within

963
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,839
that policy amount of time decrement uh

964
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,839
decrementation

965
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,879
then the original decision that alice

966
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:47,520
made

967
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,480
will be revoked and this is a pretty

968
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,159
straight ahead thing you can you can do

969
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,560
a one over x decision matrix too it's

970
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,440
the same thing

971
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,960
the logic is the same you're just

972
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,040
flipping your uh your outputs and

973
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,320
decisions

974
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,920
this says i want all of my two-man rule

975
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,800
decisions or

976
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,880
three or four doesn't matter the logic

977
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,000
is the same

978
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,920
to occur within a certain period of time

979
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,720
with a certain level of confidence based

980
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,000
upon the trust

981
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,240
and then there's the truth table that

982
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,520
comes out of this

983
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,359
which starts giving us some additional

984
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,599
insights into what we're doing

985
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,079
now part of the thing that occurs here

986
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,440
and i don't expect you to get all of

987
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,119
this immediately and that's why it'll be

988
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,280
made available is if you notice the

989
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,160
yellow uh

990
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,880
in the right what i'm doing is uh

991
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,599
increasing the decrementing time

992
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,680
so i'm doing it in the upper left from

993
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,760
one second then down to 100 seconds down

994
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,520
to 700 seconds

995
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,839
and when we throw all the math at it

996
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,440
what ends up happening is you can look

997
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,079
at the

998
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,720
risk reduction in the lower right cell

999
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,240
and the risk reduction goes

1000
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,280
way the hell up when my time is small

1001
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,480
when my time is big my wrist reduction

1002
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,000
is not nearly as good at all so this is

1003
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,760
part of the mechanism that we can use to

1004
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,800
find out

1005
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,960
how well am i really doing when i plug

1006
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,119
numbers into the equation

1007
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,560
so now we get back to the vendor

1008
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,160
question how good are these vendor

1009
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,280
products

1010
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,240
well in this case i'm going to pick a

1011
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,599
malware

1012
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,680
detection mechanism because it's easy

1013
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,119
and i view most stuff

1014
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,079
in networks as being black boxes because

1015
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,920
99.99 of the time we have no idea what's

1016
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,839
going on inside of these things

1017
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,119
at all we just no clue what is going on

1018
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,839
so let's treat it as a black box so what

1019
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:36,240
i

1020
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,680
have been suggesting and getting some

1021
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,720
people to do is a black box we know how

1022
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
it should look under normal operating

1023
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,320
conditions so i can get an input and i

1024
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,440
can get an output

1025
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,680
and everything is straight at now it

1026
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,800
should be able to

1027
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,320
detect some known samples of badness

1028
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,520
code badness

1029
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,880
all right what i want to do then is

1030
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,200
inject that in to the good

1031
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,280
data stream start a clock

1032
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,400
and wait for the black box to tell me i

1033
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,200
saw something

1034
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,680
i saw something bad question is how long

1035
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,920
did that take

1036
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,720
why don't we know this answer

1037
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,079
contextually

1038
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,560
from our vendors well the vendors i've

1039
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,119
spoken to don't like the question

1040
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,200
because it shows some drastic

1041
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,839
differences in performance between them

1042
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,839
and then we can extrapolate all of this

1043
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,040
of course into the right

1044
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,200
to include reaction matrixes and the

1045
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,280
reaction process where we start another

1046
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,320
clock

1047
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,160
to say okay i've got my detection that

1048
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,400
occurred in x period of time

1049
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,359
or it's t one minus t zero time as per

1050
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,520
the first detection out of the black box

1051
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,920
do the same thing for reaction reaction

1052
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,720
uh can be defined as full mitigation

1053
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,760
shutdown turn off whatever you are

1054
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,599
satisfied with

1055
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,599
is the answer from a corporate policy

1056
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,960
standpoint

1057
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,599
so we understand how to do this but what

1058
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,280
we need is also to start

1059
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,520
measuring all of this stuff and then

1060
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,320
we've got

1061
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,640
this thing that has been over the years

1062
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,680
it's been called

1063
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,119
i'm going to have two products do the

1064
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,280
job i'm going to buy one

1065
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,400
for fee and i'll pay the subscription

1066
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,440
fee the other one is going to be free

1067
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,200
and between the two of them i should be

1068
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,680
all right well yes and no depends how

1069
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,200
you configure it

1070
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,320
if you can figure them any mechanisms

1071
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,119
that are doing this

1072
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,960
and with an or gate and saying oh if

1073
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,400
either one detects it i'm good

1074
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,160
you're going to end up with lower

1075
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,720
reliability lower efficacy of

1076
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,560
the operation of that particular black

1077
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,920
box what you need to do is the same

1078
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,320
thing that we did with the two-man rule

1079
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,920
is and them they both need to detect it

1080
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,680
in order to have a high confidence

1081
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,520
factor that the output

1082
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,280
in this case is going to trigger

1083
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,640
something problem uh

1084
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,839
properly now how do we do this uh

1085
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,640
we actually do some of this right now i

1086
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,400
want to do something on my bank and it's

1087
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,079
going to say you really can't do this

1088
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,040
until uh you we verify who you are so

1089
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,960
there's a pause that goes on

1090
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,200
i get an out-of-band communication to me

1091
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,160
that says

1092
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,079
uh here's a code i have x period of time

1093
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,800
to enter it based upon the bank sets rt

1094
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,480
policy up there

1095
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,880
go no go decision and it moves on so

1096
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,680
we're doing

1097
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,400
some of this right now but we can do

1098
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,680
better than this

1099
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,560
what about with phishing same sort of

1100
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,160
thing

1101
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,240
there are inventories and repositories

1102
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,079
of full fishing everything

1103
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,560
who's good who's bad reputation same

1104
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,200
thing

1105
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,240
before you actually send something

1106
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,480
before you click on something

1107
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,000
we can do the same thing we can say

1108
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
pause hold let's take a look

1109
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,400
do an analysis do the risk analysis or

1110
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,960
trust analysis of what that link is

1111
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,359
what that particular operation is and

1112
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,359
create a go no-go condition

1113
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,160
based upon the policy decision same

1114
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,280
mechanism

1115
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,160
now some criticism says ah you're going

1116
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,400
to interrupt user experience well we

1117
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,000
you know we can go through databases

1118
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,440
pretty damn fast

1119
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,040
we if you're looking at a couple hundred

1120
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,920
milliseconds we're below real sensory

1121
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,760
thresholds for most human

1122
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,079
detection that's meaningful it might be

1123
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,119
a little jerk

1124
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,680
but this is where we need to amplify the

1125
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,520
encouragements of vendors to be able to

1126
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,440
increase performance so that we do

1127
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,240
actually have a measurable increase in

1128
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,040
uh

1129
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,839
the security of our networks uh how

1130
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:28,319
about

1131
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,800
data exfiltration same thing the same

1132
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,280
model exists before we send out

1133
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,040
stuff what do i not want to send out

1134
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,480
that's policy

1135
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,800
i don't want to send out xls's uh i

1136
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,560
don't want to send out files that say

1137
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,760
human resources

1138
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,880
whatever the list is this goes back

1139
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,000
to an smtp sort of detection filtering

1140
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,040
mechanism

1141
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,839
before the data is actually allowed or

1142
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,359
out of the organization and this is

1143
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,000
something

1144
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,079
that people will not notice at all

1145
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,680
because this is on

1146
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,520
the output we always say the up speed

1147
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,200
doesn't matter as much as downspeed

1148
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,400
because the humans aren't going to

1149
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,359
notice it

1150
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,200
cool let's take that same approach and

1151
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,280
see if this will actually work

1152
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,119
and there's different models does alice

1153
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,880
going to check her own work is bob going

1154
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,240
to check alice's work

1155
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,079
and again the same circuits are going to

1156
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,560
work in any of these types of models now

1157
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,960
i keep mentioning that this is about

1158
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,319
time it's about

1159
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,319
everything is going to change over time

1160
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,440
and trust

1161
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,720
degrades over time by definition

1162
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,839
how do i know that in one year you are

1163
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,079
as trustworthy as you were today unless

1164
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:32,800
i have

1165
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,560
know everything that you have done every

1166
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,240
conversation you have ever had

1167
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,800
how do i know all of this well i can

1168
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,480
make some assumptions

1169
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
and again these are initial assumptions

1170
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,839
that have to be made and that's the same

1171
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,680
way that bayes probability works as well

1172
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,640
you have to make some initial

1173
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,560
assumptions and get the system

1174
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,599
tuned up now trust degradation can occur

1175
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,520
in three ways linear exponential

1176
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,280
or logarithmic and keep in mind as your

1177
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,480
trust goes down

1178
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,560
over whatever period of time it is your

1179
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,640
risk starts going up

1180
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,720
and again there's that ugly symbol there

1181
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,920
infinity

1182
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,079
so when we start looking at trust

1183
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,200
factors

1184
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,920
and i'm using 0.9 as the reference one

1185
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,480
that we were

1186
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,359
earlier on the upper left uh what we're

1187
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,720
doing is saying

1188
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,400
in our policy model if we can retrust

1189
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,680
sorry re-vet the same event the same

1190
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,599
condition the same decision

1191
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,680
over and over again we're going to raise

1192
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,200
our baseline

1193
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,480
of trust for that cool uh

1194
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,480
in the middle we're looking at the

1195
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,319
dynamics of time

1196
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,119
over trust factor and this in this case

1197
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,560
it's a simple

1198
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,680
uh linear uh degradation

1199
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,800
of trust over time based upon a perhaps

1200
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,680
a guess

1201
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,359
that i want to re-vet uh bob

1202
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,079
every 30 days every 90 days whatever

1203
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,200
those criteria

1204
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,079
are which would trigger the re-vetting

1205
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,119
and based upon

1206
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,440
assuming that it's a good revet would

1207
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,440
increase uh the trust factor

1208
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,680
way back up linearly and so these are

1209
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,200
different ways of looking at these

1210
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,480
problems now when we get

1211
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,280
into the granularity and the precision

1212
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,440
that we often need when an organization

1213
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,520
has a billion emails or more

1214
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,599
going in and out of an organization on a

1215
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,720
yearly basis

1216
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,440
we're dealing with a whole mess of

1217
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,720
decimal points

1218
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,119
so i i made up and came up with another

1219
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,000
way to look

1220
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,800
at it just using another nomenclature so

1221
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,079
we don't have to deal with

1222
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,839
all of the damn nines that are going to

1223
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,119
be inherent

1224
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,359
in a very well very fine-tuned analog

1225
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:38,079
detection

1226
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,440
and reaction network and that brings up

1227
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,880
detection and depth

1228
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,240
the reason planes don't crash is because

1229
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,040
engine technology in this particular one

1230
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,160
uh there's over

1231
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,319
5 000 sensors that in real time

1232
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,119
are activating their internal network

1233
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:57,920
with

1234
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,880
once a second updated information like

1235
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,000
the human brain

1236
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,040
we are designed to survive

1237
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,200
we are designed to predict the future

1238
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,119
which allows us to survive the same

1239
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,920
model occurs in detection and depth

1240
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,400
yet detection and depth is still not

1241
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,400
part of the vernacular of our world

1242
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,200
because

1243
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,800
defense and depth but if you can't

1244
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,280
measure the defense what are you doing

1245
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,400
so the bottom there is a two layer

1246
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,119
defensive

1247
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,480
uh in defense and depth network taking a

1248
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,079
simple tbs formula

1249
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,880
showing that the same process can occur

1250
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,200
for

1251
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,119
all of the sub components no matter how

1252
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,680
deep we go within the environment

1253
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,280
same thing then you apply it to ooda

1254
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,319
loop how many layers of depth do i want

1255
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:43,200
to have

1256
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,040
so on the left what have i got i got

1257
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,720
three layers of depth

1258
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,560
uh for each of the decisions that are

1259
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,000
being made is this code

1260
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,839
is it human is it operational doesn't

1261
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,000
matter abstractly the principle's the

1262
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,640
same

1263
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,480
and then when we start talking about

1264
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,920
adding neural

1265
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,880
and a.i sort of things into it it starts

1266
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,560
to look a little bit more like the

1267
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,960
drawing on the right so how do you win

1268
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,160
this thing

1269
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,880
this is how you win it we have to be

1270
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,160
able to measure

1271
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,480
our detection and our reaction we have

1272
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,480
to be able to anticipate

1273
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,839
and understand what our adversaries are

1274
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,760
doing what they're capable of doing

1275
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,400
and start modeling this mathematically

1276
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,680
we understand that

1277
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,920
according to boyd and i buy and do it

1278
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,920
and i think it's common sense so if

1279
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,000
we can argue this is that if you were

1280
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,800
inside of your adversary's decision loop

1281
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,720
you're going to win you're going to win

1282
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,480
we understand the math

1283
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,200
we understand how to do an awful lot of

1284
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,800
these things and just what's not been

1285
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,440
done

1286
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,200
is a whole heck of a lot of prototyping

1287
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,040
i'm working on one prototype of another

1288
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,000
application

1289
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,040
for limiting ddos at tier one networks

1290
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,880
this is another type of prototype that

1291
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,119
would uh need to be done

1292
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,480
so what can be done now uh

1293
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,040
we can measure most of this stuff we can

1294
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,839
do this

1295
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:03,520
right now yet for whatever reasons we

1296
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,920
have chosen not to is it too hard is it

1297
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,920
too much of a rethink are the vendors

1298
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,119
really going to hate it

1299
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,160
because right now a to a apple to apple

1300
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,640
comparisons between vendors is so

1301
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,440
absurdly hard and they're all throwing

1302
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,760
more and more buzzwords at us

1303
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,240
but where is the efficacy where is the

1304
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,920
proof of it all

1305
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,160
i return then to my axioms which i'll

1306
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,000
ask you to read at another time and

1307
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,359
that's great because

1308
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,440
i'm not going to read the whole slide

1309
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,400
please buy my

1310
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,119
book go get my other books they're all

1311
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,640
for free out there

1312
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,560
if you really want to dig deep into the

1313
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,640
math behind all this thing these are the

1314
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,880
fundamental formulas i'll get my math

1315
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,599
guy

1316
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,400
uh dr mark carney uh to work with you if

1317
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,359
you want to really dig

1318
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,200
into it and start playing with this

1319
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,760
stuff uh if you're interested in a cheat

1320
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,160
sheet

1321
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,280
on all of these formulas how they work

1322
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,280
how they interact and some basics on

1323
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,079
bayesian

1324
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,040
probabilistics and how uh they tie into

1325
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,680
all of this

1326
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,400
i'll be happy to just drop me an email

1327
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,560
and i'll be happy to send it to you

1328
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,280
and uh that's the end of it i am done

1329
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,119
and i was told to have 10 minutes left

1330
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,560
and i have 10 minutes left

1331
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,040
uh thank you in um 10 minutes of course

1332
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,160
being

1333
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,040
a relativistic time there so

1334
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,720
we appreciate that there's a lot of

1335
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,200
material that you packed into that talk

1336
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,520
that i think for some of our attendees

1337
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,240
uh

1338
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,960
may not be immediately clear but the

1339
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,079
book

1340
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,720
uh time-based security does lay this out

1341
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,000
in greater detail

1342
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,160
and presents the math of it i don't

1343
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,680
analog network security

1344
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,040
or analog network security but you've

1345
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,559
got the time-based security time-based

1346
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:47,520
security gives

1347
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,079
all the basic frameworks that then lead

1348
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,079
up to what the analog network security

1349
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,920
did yeah yeah so we have two questions

1350
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,880
in the q a

1351
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,240
for you to uh perhaps look at and give

1352
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,200
us an answer

1353
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,280
yeah crypt analysis probabilistic sure

1354
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,640
it's time based

1355
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,119
absolutely uh anything that has time is

1356
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,880
its fundamental component

1357
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,960
krypton uh how good that's why we're

1358
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,079
going through it now

1359
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,200
quantum crypto post quantum crypto how

1360
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,720
long does it take to

1361
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,040
and if they're looking at the world

1362
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,000
really very well

1363
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,160
in this case making sure that they've

1364
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,119
got the proper

1365
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,319
tamper-proof detection mechanisms uh a

1366
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,760
proper reaction

1367
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,559
uh protocol built into it and again i

1368
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:31,520
would refer

1369
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,760
you to dr mark carney who's doing a

1370
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,280
tremendous amount of work in

1371
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,640
qkd in this area but yes uh

1372
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,319
if some of you may recall back in uh 76

1373
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,280
or 77

1374
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,640
uh nist at that point

1375
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,240
no national bureau of standards became

1376
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,960
this and they uh approved dez

1377
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,720
to uh secure crypto stuff for banking or

1378
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,280
whatever

1379
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,240
and then along came deep think or

1380
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,119
something

1381
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,280
deep crack and that was in the early 90s

1382
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,520
and it was a homebrew project

1383
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,160
uh to crack it and it was cracked within

1384
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,599
24 hours

1385
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,800
and then all of these periods of it

1386
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,720
occur with whether it's ecc or

1387
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,880
any type of crypto they're all subject

1388
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,040
to some sort of time based function

1389
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,520
so yeah i fully agree with that time

1390
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,520
dependence security relative to the

1391
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,480
gravity well

1392
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,520
happens to be in yes um it absolutely

1393
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,000
does

1394
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,839
if you're sitting on the schwartz child

1395
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,280
radius

1396
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,319
of any black hole at all uh yes

1397
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,880
uh this entire formula completely

1398
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,359
collapses due to the simultaneity

1399
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:41,040
of the inanity of that question

1400
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,839
thank you richard

1401
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,920
uh if the security solution can't see

1402
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,200
the threat how do you model these

1403
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,079
timings

1404
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,000
that's one of the things that hackers

1405
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,319
have been saying for 30 years

1406
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,960
think like a bad guy if you're only

1407
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,000
thinking like a good

1408
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,680
guy don't even bother playing don't play

1409
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,599
uh if you're thinking like a good guy

1410
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,119
and you open a jewelry store you're not

1411
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,440
gonna have an alarm system

1412
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,000
uh you have to think like a bad guy you

1413
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,760
gotta stay up on top of

1414
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,040
all of the the noise out there with the

1415
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,040
hacker community with black cat with all

1416
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,240
of the zero all of this

1417
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,880
you got to stay on top of it absolutely

1418
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,000
and

1419
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,920
the time-based modeling of it is

1420
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,640
something that i hope becomes uh

1421
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,240
more of a common way of examining the

1422
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:30,960
problem

1423
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,800
but it's not there yet but yeah you've

1424
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,400
got to stay on top of all this crowd

1425
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,079
strikes planted the dnc

1426
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,240
evidence i have no idea i don't even i

1427
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,119
no that's not i don't live there sorry

1428
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:43,920
simon

1429
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,119
uh companies don't i'm not sure what

1430
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,000
that actually meant

1431
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:54,480
but uh okay relatives expense even more

1432
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,319
security two more people

1433
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,400
you can see if one of them is dead yeah

1434
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,240
of course yeah richard that no that's

1435
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,440
absolutely right

1436
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,079
and that's why it's all about risk and

1437
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:05,760
i'm just turning it upside down

1438
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,240
because this industry we've had one hell

1439
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,200
of a hard time

1440
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,720
coming up with how do you how do you

1441
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,640
measure risk because there are so many

1442
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,319
assumptions in there

1443
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:17,280
and uh i've seen the formulas risk

1444
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,240
equals

1445
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,559
temperature time gravity well times

1446
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,640
number of people divided by

1447
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,640
emails i mean you read all these various

1448
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,160
risk formulas

1449
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,280
and but they never grapple with hard

1450
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,319
math they're very

1451
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,680
uh amorphous and vaporous which is why i

1452
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,200
went over to rick over to trust models

1453
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,960
look at trust are we going to get an

1454
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,800
absolute answer that's part of the issue

1455
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,160
no you're not going to get an absolute

1456
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,440
answer but you have a hell of a lot

1457
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,839
better control over arriving at an

1458
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,119
approximation

1459
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,599
for you to begin with because you have

1460
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,440
other criteria it's not a binary

1461
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,119
criteria i trust you i risk you or

1462
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:55,839
whatever

1463
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,640
there's lots of sub-criteria with lots

1464
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,359
of waiting

1465
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,079
and that ends up mirroring the way the

1466
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,319
brain works and neural uh

1467
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,200
networks are working

1468
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,359
they don't follow what the black cats do

1469
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,400
it's why i infiltrate

1470
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,240
okay then infiltrate away

1471
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,400
again that's not something that i do i

1472
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,240
think about you infiltrators and how

1473
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,920
long it takes you to do it

1474
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,359
but i i do not infiltrate anymore

1475
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,839
yeah i think that was in response to uh

1476
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,920
or an expansion on this first one where

1477
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,440
you said companies don't

1478
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,960
saying companies don't follow what the

1479
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,440
black hats do

1480
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,400
um they don't i mean the research

1481
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,760
on it they're well they're still

1482
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,880
you mean they don't stay up to speed on

1483
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,240
what's going on

1484
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,880
i didn't ask the question i'm just okay

1485
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,319
i think it's more about you know not

1486
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:49,359
understanding

1487
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,400
the the black hats you know people well

1488
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,440
then

1489
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,319
that that's a fundamental cultural

1490
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:56,880
problem

1491
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,040
that i can't help you with it's like

1492
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,000
here's what you got to do

1493
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,440
i'm not the only one who's this has been

1494
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,160
the same message for 30 years

1495
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,440
so uh yep all right

1496
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,839
our evil has been marauding across the

1497
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:10,880
globe

1498
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,599
let's see what are they doing now what

1499
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,280
is we seem to be focused on protection

1500
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,559
strategies what do you think will take

1501
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,359
to shift into an offensive ozone

1502
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:20,880
i don't think i can answer that really

1503
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,559
quickly i think i would need to think up

1504
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,599
on that

1505
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,040
um the you got to look at the common

1506
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,160
attack vectors the attack vectors are

1507
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,040
don't change based upon the payload uh

1508
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,880
this goes back to what we were talking

1509
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,599
gene what

1510
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,319
30 years ago with information warfare uh

1511
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:39,680
you can examine an

1512
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,839
awful lot of uh these types of attacks

1513
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:45,200
and each one is going to have its

1514
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,599
individual payload and object of the

1515
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,319
of the attack uh so they're all payload

1516
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,240
independent but they are very

1517
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,280
vector intrusive dependent and i think

1518
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,520
the last number i heard was 92 percent

1519
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,040
of them all begin with some level of

1520
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,559
social engineering i don't know

1521
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,680
70 probably something like that and

1522
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,200
then it's going to be behavioral

1523
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,079
analysis over a stolen identity in a

1524
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,240
network

1525
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,760
i don't think that changes absolutely

1526
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,040
anything i'm saying here it's a

1527
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,359
different way of looking

1528
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,480
and detecting we don't do a whole

1529
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,680
lot of individual endpoint detection

1530
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,800
to the level that i would like to see

1531
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,440
and part of that is a political cultural

1532
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,319
problem and

1533
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,480
part of it is a resource problem because

1534
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,319
that can heat up a bunch of

1535
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,720
a bunch of bandwidth that you're at your

1536
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,319
end point especially with all the mobile

1537
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:39,839
ones

1538
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,680
okay no coin but very seeing how the

1539
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,119
math actually proves the need for

1540
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,079
segregation of

1541
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,599
duties however oh thank you kaelin thank

1542
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,520
you appreciate that

1543
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,319
it's about bad people not bad code um i

1544
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,160
would argue that bad code can be

1545
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,720
designed by good people

1546
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,280
uh errors um how many organizations

1547
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,799
have a specialist that

1548
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,680
whose entire job you're going to give

1549
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,400
them

1550
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,000
here's 50 000 lines of code

1551
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,119
there's two semicolons out of place go

1552
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,280
find them

1553
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,200
what kind of person does that somebody

1554
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,680
on the spectrum

1555
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,480
will really help because they love those

1556
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,319
kinds of problems

1557
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,079
that's a perfect problem for them yet

1558
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,000
they'll never get through hr

1559
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,599
and then this brings me down the whole

1560
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,440
hiring the unhirable thing which is

1561
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,559
another set of

1562
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,839
equations but we have the tools if we

1563
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:41,520
chose to use them in many cases

1564
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,839
well good um the rest are just sort of

1565
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:48,640
comments and

1566
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,880
we've pretty much hit the end of our

1567
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,000
time here

1568
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,359
um when i'd like to invite you to come

1569
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:57,119
back

1570
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,240
to well actually visit in person

1571
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,799
that purdue sometime uh in the not too

1572
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:04,480
distant future because it would be great

1573
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,440
to have you

1574
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,319
here in person giving another talk and

1575
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,280
being able to

1576
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,640
interact in person with some of the

1577
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,480
people here i want to have some real

1578
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,119
arguments

1579
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,599
let's go out afterwards and drink beers

1580
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,280
and cheap french red wine and

1581
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,160
argue all right that sounds like a great

1582
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:20,960
plan

1583
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,720
i'll buy the first round for whoever
