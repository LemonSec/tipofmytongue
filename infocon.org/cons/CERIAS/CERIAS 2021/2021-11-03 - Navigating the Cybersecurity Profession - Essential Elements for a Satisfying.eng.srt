uh hosted by sirius at purdue

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,039

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,640
currently with cisco but before that had

12

a

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,400
story career at jp morgan and

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,040
where she was the cso and actually won a

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,120
north american award for her work there

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,440
as you hear her talk if you have

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,640
questions

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,039
please put them in the q a and she'll

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,360
as she's talking or at the end we'll go

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,640
through some of them and answer

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,640
questions and you may notice that she's

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,879
talking she has what you may perceive to

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,879
be a little bit of an accent yes that's

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,199
an ohio accent

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,640
right yeah

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,600

so without further ado let me turn it

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,479
over to helen and she'll tell us about

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,560
navigating the cyber security profession

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,880
so thank you for being here yeah thanks

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,799

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
jp morgan for about 10 years i was at

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,720
the ohio state university don't at me

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,119
about our football team right now

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,880
uh for about eight years and most

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,360
currently i'm at cisco and

46
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,479
um

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,680
my

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,320
own career path through cyber security

49
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,720
has been one of accidents and

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,600
misadventure and not particularly much

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,040
intentional

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,439
um but i've been in the industry not as

53
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,719
long as staff but i've been in the

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,600
industry for a couple of decades plus or

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,560
minus

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,079
a few years

57
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,880
and

58
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,719
particularly when i was at ohio state a

59
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,318
lot of people would call me up and say

60
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,959
hey helen can i have coffee with you i

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,760
want to pick your brain about some

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,920
career thing and it could have been a

63
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,280
student who was thinking about getting

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,800
into cyber security or it could have

65
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,280
been someone who was all in already in

66
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,120
cyber who was thinking about where they

67
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,720
wanted to go next or it could have been

68
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,080
someone who was

69
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,200
about to take on leadership of a team

70
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,560
and they would come to me with these

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,400
questions and and

72
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,680
um

73
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,680
and really they came to me with the same

74
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,080
kinds of questions to be honest over

75
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
that time

76
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
how do i get into security how do i

77
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,599
survive should i be a single contributor

78
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,800
how do i

79
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,599
uh exist as a minority how do i do these

80
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,360
things then

81
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,040
i realized that i was drinking so much

82
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,200
coffee that i was never going to sleep

83
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,000
so

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,120
what i did was i wrote a book and this

85
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,800
book is going to be coming out in

86
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
december

87
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,159
you can pre-order it now if you're so

88
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,280
inclined

89
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,760
but i took all of these questions and i

90
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,280
put them down on paper and

91
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,360
wrote and rewrote and thought about

92
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,040
rewriting again and i asked some people

93
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,159
to help me

94
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,720
think about the answers to the questions

95
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,400
and here we are with this

96
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,360
book

97
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,080
so

98
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,959
what i wanted to do today was to talk

99
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,760
through some of those questions and sort

100
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,120
of examine

101
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,680
what they mean and as i go through this

102
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,680
if you have questions do put them into

103
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,159
the q a um and i'll i'll try and

104
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,200
incorporate them into the talk as i go

105
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400
um

106
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
it is

107
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,640
being in security is

108
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,840
a rewarding

109
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,360
challenging um

110
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,280
well-paying often choice to make but it

111
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,680
also comes with some baby dragons

112
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,519
downsides as well

113
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,879
um and so part of writing this book was

114
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,040
not only to help people see the goodness

115
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,760
in cyber security but to also watch out

116
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,360
for some of the landmines that come

117
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,519
along with it as well so this is what

118
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,680
we're going to be talking about today

119
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,959
so let's jump on in

120
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,720
so i'm going to give you the short

121
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,959
answers to all those questions

122
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,560
um and then if you decide you don't want

123
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,160
to listen any further you can drop off

124
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,199
the call

125
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,000
um but here here's the short

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,960
the short answer to all the questions

127
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,479
the first is

128
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,720
you have to know yourself and what do i

129
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,440
mean by that what i mean by that is

130
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,199
you have to have some self-awareness

131
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,960
about what you value

132
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,000
what you

133
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,960
enjoy doing not just in a security sense

134
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,919
but sort of in general are you a

135
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,880
analytic kind of person do you

136
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,720
need to have all the data before you

137
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,080
make a decision

138
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,560
do you like playing with

139
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,720
things electronic things robot things

140
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,560
legos puzzles

141
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,960
are you a tinkerer do you like breaking

142
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,039
things and seeing how they get can be

143
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,039
put back together

144
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,800
do you like working in a group do you

145
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,960
like working by yourself are you really

146
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,560
happy to be working at home in your

147
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,080
jammies right now or do you want to be

148
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,680
back in an office

149
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,759
or in a classroom

150
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,600
um with a whole bunch of people around

151
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,320
you bouncing ideas off you all the time

152
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,680
along with you know germs

153
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,800
what is it about yourself that you would

154
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
bring to the security

155
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,360
job if you had one or what do you bring

156
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,680
to your security job if you have one

157
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,120
so the first thing is you've got to know

158
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,560
yourself and so

159
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,000
whether you're talking about how do i

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,400
get into security or whether i should be

161
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
a manager versus a single contributor or

162
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,919
whatever

163
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,400
understanding what you value is going to

164
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,880
help you make a good choice that's going

165
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,440
to bring you energy and bring you joy

166
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,280
and not bring you stress and bring you

167
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,680
down so number one

168
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,199
know yourself

169
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,039
number two

170
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,080
network and network here refers to

171
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,759
people networking

172
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,680
there is a lot going on in cyber

173
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,479
security you can't know it all people

174
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,720
who are in college and come to me say i

175
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,960
want to work in security and i say well

176
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
what does that mean to you

177
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,759
and

178
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,240
typically they may have an image of

179
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,400
someone sitting at a computer keyboard

180
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,440
coding

181
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,360
but for a lot of us who work in security

182
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
we never actually

183
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,319
code or we never actually build we might

184
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,400
spend a lot of time talking with our

185
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,520
lawyers or with our compliance partners

186
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,319
or

187
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,520
with other vendors and

188
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
what you find as you try and navigate

189
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,759
the security career is there's so much

190
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,039
going on

191
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,960
that you can't stay on top of all of it

192
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,880
and you're going to rely on other people

193
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,440
to fill in the gaps in your knowledge

194
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,840
and to provide a support network for you

195
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,199
and i'll go into that in a little more

196
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,759
detail later but networking having a

197
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,479
network both of immediate people around

198
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,639
you who are in your class or in your

199
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,440
workplace who are your support structure

200
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,680
there is really important but having a

201
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,479
broader network of people whether that's

202
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,280
on social media or through professional

203
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,319
groups or whatever who might also be

204
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,319
able to give you advice but not be so

205
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,160
close to what you do on a day-to-day

206
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,720
basis that they're influenced by it can

207
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,919
be super useful so having a network and

208
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,599
a plan for networking

209
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,960
is also very important if you're going

210
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,680
to be successful in security

211
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,319
thirdly you've got to stay curious i

212
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,240
think this is maybe an overused trope

213
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,800
but i think it's true and that is there

214
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,560
is always things that are changing and

215
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,319
if you're the kind of person that wants

216
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,080
to do the same thing over and over and

217
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,880
over again and be pretty static this

218
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,280
isn't going to be the industry for you

219
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,039
on the other hand

220
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,639
there is so much going on that you have

221
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,240
to be intentional about where you get

222
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,560
your information how you consume your

223
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,639
information or you will be drowned in it

224
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,520
so

225
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,680
staying curious is really important and

226
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,840
then of course being able to communicate

227
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,199
well i don't care what job you're in

228
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,759
you need to be able to communicate well

229
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,280
with yourself

230
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,599
with your partners with your teammates

231
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,800
with your customers with your clients

232
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
and you need to be communicating well

233
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,199
and often again things change really

234
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,800
quickly and if they're really going to

235
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
understand you and where you're coming

236
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,160
from you need to be able to to

237
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,080
communicate well whether that's

238
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,440
written or verbal or preferably both

239
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,680
that needs to come across and all of

240
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,360
these things knowing yourself having a

241
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,039
network being curious will help you

242
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,000
communicate well so this is the short

243
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
version of the book

244
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,440
so

245
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
if you take nothing else away take that

246
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
today

247
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,600
so let's start with some self-awareness

248
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,560
um

249
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,920
one of the things i do through the book

250
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,080
is i reference other books because i'm a

251
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
huge reader

252
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,000
and there is more information out there

253
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,760
that i could possibly stuff into my

254
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,480
little book so one of the things that

255
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,680
you'll see as we go through this

256
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,279
presentation is

257
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,800
other books that i would recommend you

258
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,720
take a look at starting with why by

259
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,680
signing simon sinek is fabulous i don't

260
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,279
see a lot of books out there in the

261
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,440
specifically cyber security industry

262
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,920
that talk about the why of cyber

263
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,040
security

264
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,120
but you are going to need it whether

265
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,279
you're looking for your first job or

266
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,640
deciding

267
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,240
where you're going to head next if

268
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,680
you've been in the industry for a little

269
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,760
while or even if you're taking on a

270
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,000
leadership role people around you want

271
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,200
to know

272
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,080
what you value what your priorities are

273
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,320
how you like to communicate what your

274
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,640
work style is

275
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,000
but why are you in security um when i

276
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,399
was a ciso at ohio state this was a big

277
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,760
question because there were a lot of

278
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,080
people around me who didn't understand

279
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,440
security

280
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,399
didn't want to understand security and i

281
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,040
had to do a lot of organizational change

282
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,440
to be able to get them prepared to even

283
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,080
take a suggestion of some security thing

284
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
i wanted them to do

285
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,680
so there was this question of

286
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,480
well why helen why do you do security

287
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,320
why is it important to you

288
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,440
and i think when you look at the

289
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,839
security industry there will be groups

290
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,640
of people that sort of fall into

291
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,800
similar patterns of why

292
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,560
some people come out of the military for

293
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
example and they have really a service

294
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,560
component to what they do

295
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,959
some people like taking geeking out on

296
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,160
tech

297
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,839
and so that you know they're really in

298
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,200
it because intellectually it's

299
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,120
stimulating for them

300
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,240
for me

301
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,720
um it's all about vanilla ice cream and

302
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
what do i mean by that i'm the kind of

303
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,839
person that

304
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,959
if i'm

305
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,880
going to the office on a regular basis

306
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,640
which isn't happening now thank goodness

307
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,720
but typically if i'm going to the office

308
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,480
on a regular basis i would park in the

309
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,120
same parking spot every single time so i

310
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,480
didn't have to think too hard about

311
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,839
where i'd parked and i didn't have to

312
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,600
remember where i parked once i came out

313
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,040
at the end of the day

314
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,720
i liked my day to be predictable i like

315
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,399
um i don't actually like surprises that

316
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,279
much and for me security

317
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,079
was a great place to work where i could

318
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,800
help an organization

319
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,120
be predictable be

320
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,120
reliable be trustworthy right and

321
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,959
if i had to sum it up in a word it was

322
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,640
vanilla ice cream

323
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,160
so for me

324
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,720
i knew that what i enjoyed about

325
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,880
security was being able to give to

326
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,240
somebody else

327
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,839
some stability and to give some

328
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,959
certainty and to not have bad things

329
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,000
happen like the northeast power outage

330
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,200
or 911 which were really some and y2k

331
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,399
and other things which were really

332
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,399
seminal events in my own security

333
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,680
journey

334
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,120
so think about yourself think about

335
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,079
what

336
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:48,959
you

337
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,440
like about security i don't mean what do

338
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,519
you like to do in security but what is

339
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,680
the purpose of security

340
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,000
for you or information risk management

341
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,120
for you

342
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,519
and how would that then apply to the job

343
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,800
that you have

344
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,040
so some self-awareness is a great place

345
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,120
to start this book from simon sinek is a

346
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,200
great book to read if you're not sure

347
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,480
how to do it

348
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,360
but

349
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,600
simply going away and sitting down and

350
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,519
just spending some time in your own head

351
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,480
going why why security what is it about

352
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,160
this thing that i like and if you don't

353
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,560
have a good answer for that or at least

354
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,040
an answer that feels

355
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,720
right to you

356
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,320
then um

357
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,920
keep thinking about it before you jump

358
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
into security or if you're already into

359
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,760
security you might want to consider

360
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,360
getting out which is certainly an option

361
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,839
as well so self-awareness is one of the

362
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,480
first things

363
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,800
networking we talked about this a little

364
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,040
bit already um this is a great book by

365
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
the way tribe of hackers by marcus kerry

366
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,680
and jennifer ginn um lots of advice from

367
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
lots of people around the globe who've

368
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,519
been in cyber security for a while

369
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,240
specifically hacking

370
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,800
hacking is a interesting term in cyber

371
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,760
security as well but networking is

372
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,160
really super important

373
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,639
we talked about the support aspects of

374
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,160
networking

375
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,320
but there is more to having a network of

376
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,160
people than just support

377
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,480
certainly community engagement is useful

378
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,120
one of the things that you'll find is as

379
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,519
you start to know more about security

380
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,600
you need to be able to share it with

381
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,200
other people

382
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,880
for a couple of reasons one a lot of

383
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
people like giving back not everybody

384
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,560
but a lot of people do and having a

385
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,240
network is a place where you can give

386
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,880
back but having a network gives you a

387
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,279
place where you can exchange ideas and

388
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,240
hone your understanding of your craft

389
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,760
so community engagement is a big piece

390
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,279
of networking

391
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,959
it's certainly

392
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,360
necessary i think to land a really good

393
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,519
security job most of the people who are

394
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,160
in security roles that they really enjoy

395
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,519
will tell you

396
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,839
they came to that not because of a jobs

397
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,760
board online but because they knew

398
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,600
someone who recommended them for the

399
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,639
role or they'd heard through someone at

400
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,639
a networking event that a job had become

401
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,680
available that they wouldn't have

402
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,560
otherwise heard of so getting into

403
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,720
security certainly relies on networks

404
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,920
but being able to get good at security

405
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,399
also relies on networks and a lot of the

406
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,760
professional

407
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,880
organizations like issa or isc squared

408
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,079
or others sans have training available

409
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,880
to you as well so you can have informal

410
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,040
learning through conversations and

411
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,959
conferences but you can also have formal

412
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,639
training as well

413
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,399
and it will help you with your career

414
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,839
planning again whether you're new to

415
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,680
security wanting to get into security or

416
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,920
you've been here for a while

417
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,040
it's really changing a lot if you um go

418
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,519
online and search for

419
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,760
um

420
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,120
the cso mind maps csi

421
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,079
ciso mind maps there are a ton of mind

422
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,079
maps out there that sort of try and map

423
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,320
out all the different pieces of security

424
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,240
and those maps are growing year over

425
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,720
year over year over year

426
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,480
because the industry is changing and

427
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,959
what we do in security is changing

428
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,279
having a network of people around you

429
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,360
will let you know what's

430
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,920
uh got legs and what doesn't what's

431
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,160
flash in the pan and what's not

432
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,839
where the job opportunities are that

433
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,920
might suit you and your values and your

434
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,240
style they will be able to help you with

435
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,160
that so it will help you with career

436
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,360
planning to have a network as well

437
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,880
all right

438
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,639
i'm not seeing any questions pop up in

439
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,560
the q a yet so feel free to throw them

440
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,759
in there

441
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,480
because i'm curious about what you might

442
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,160
be thinking about with all of this stuff

443
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,199
right now

444
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,839
staying curious is about continuously

445
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,759
learning one of the questions that i'm

446
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,560
asked often when i sit down with folks

447
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
and have coffee with them or whatever

448
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,279
beverage is how do you stay on top of

449
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,040
all the information

450
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,600
um there are certainly great seminars

451
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,240
like this one um and the whole serious

452
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,600
series um there are podcasts that you

453
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,839
can be listening to there are books

454
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,680
you'll see a link here on the on the

455
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,800
presentation to the cyber canon which

456
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,639
happens to be housed right now at osu

457
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,959
but actually started at palo alto and if

458
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,399
you go to the cyber canon you're going

459
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,720
to find a whole bunch of books and each

460
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,480
one of them has been reviewed by an

461
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,920
industry professional and you can decide

462
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
by reading the reviews whether that book

463
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,959
is something good for you to read or not

464
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,959
i find a lot of my colleagues

465
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,680
will curate their information they're

466
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,440
curating their twitter feeds their

467
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,079
curating their reddit threads

468
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,079
because there is so much information out

469
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:40,880
there

470
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,279
but you do need to stay curious about it

471
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,320
it is

472
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,279
really

473
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,680
difficult to stay effective in security

474
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,279
if you keep doing the same thing day

475
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,160
after day after day or you keep thinking

476
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,199
the same thing day after day after day

477
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,639
the other thing i would tell you is

478
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,880
security doesn't exist in a vacuum it's

479
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,279
not just about technology it is also

480
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,600
about organizational structures it's

481
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,520
about psychology

482
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,160
it's about policy and law it's really an

483
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,959
interdisciplinary kind of profession and

484
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,319
so you can't only keep an eye on tech

485
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,880
although that's a big deal you also have

486
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,559
to keep an eye on what's happening

487
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,880
around you so things like

488
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,480
voting security or misinformation or

489
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,199
deep fakes or what facebook's doing with

490
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,280
their facial recognition artificial

491
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,200
intelligence database that came out

492
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,679
today those kinds of things

493
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,480
are going to have an influence on cyber

494
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,640
security where you work and where you

495
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,799
learn so you have to be able to stay

496
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,720
curious and stay on top of all of those

497
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,039
things reading helps listening helps

498
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,080
however you consume your information

499
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,480
be intentional about doing it one of the

500
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,559
things i do even when i was a cso and

501
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,320
even in the role that i'm in now is i

502
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,640
will take at least a day a quarter if

503
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,679
not more and i set it aside i block my

504
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,360
calendar so people can't schedule

505
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,640
meetings with me and i use it as a deep

506
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,320
thinking day now one of the benefits of

507
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,919
working with cisco is they do that for

508
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,000
everybody they make that happen but if

509
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,320
you're not in an organization like that

510
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,480
make time for yourself carve time out

511
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,320
consider it work time because it does

512
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,240
contribute to your work so if you can

513
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,160
schedule that time during working hours

514
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,039
but take the time to get into your head

515
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,559
and be intentional about what you're

516
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,240
learning

517
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,160
start by being really good at your job

518
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,559
how do you get great at the job you're

519
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,280
in

520
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,760
but then think about what's adjacent to

521
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,600
your job how do you start learning about

522
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,480
that and then what's within your company

523
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,320
or within your vertical whatever

524
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,640
industry you're in or whatever your

525
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,320
professional focus is whether you're a

526
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,960
pen tester or a hacker or a

527
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,120
grc governance risk and compliance

528
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,440
person

529
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,360
but stay curious about your profession

530
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
it will make you better at what you do

531
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,240
and it will make it will help

532
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,080
make sense to you

533
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,240
what you what it is you're doing and why

534
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,760
because you're continually going to be

535
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,280
asking that question yourself that

536
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,200
question why am i here why am i doing

537
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,960
this security thing and the more you

538
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,880
know about what you do the easier it

539
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,480
will be to answer those questions

540
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,559
communicate well and often this book

541
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,039
that i've got here switch is an old book

542
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,520
actually but it's a fabulous book and it

543
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,039
talks about

544
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,919
how do you do organizational change it's

545
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,160
not a security book but when you're

546
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,799
doing security a lot of the time you're

547
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,160
actually not

548
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,240
doing security you're doing

549
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
organizational change management you're

550
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,280
getting it people to change what they do

551
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,039
whether that's an application developer

552
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,880
or a network engineer

553
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,360
or you're asking executives in an

554
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,720
organization

555
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,960
or the president's cabinet of your

556
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,039
institution or wherever you work you're

557
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,919
asking them to rethink the way they work

558
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,000
the way they do things if you're going

559
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,679
to do that you have to be able to

560
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,760
communicate really well and really often

561
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,039
i found this book was really helpful

562
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,880
about that so some of what you're

563
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,960
communicating again goes back to the why

564
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
why do you do security why is security

565
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,039
important why is this

566
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,559
thing that you're trying to achieve

567
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,960
right at this exact moment important as

568
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,200
well but you're also communicating what

569
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
your role is and you've got to share

570
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,600
that widely with your community because

571
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,919
they need to understand the context in

572
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,840
which you're working

573
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,799
so

574
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,919
um

575
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,799
communicating well and often in those

576
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,960
spaces is really important in building

577
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,480
relationships and there's one thing

578
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,919
about security that people often

579
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,720
overlook and that is the most successful

580
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,919
security people build trust and the only

581
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,400
way you build trust is by building

582
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,159
relationships

583
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,520
um

584
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,440
which goes to the question that i'm just

585
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,120
seeing now pop up in the q a and the

586
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,640
question is what are your thoughts about

587
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,240
apple planning to make it easier to

588
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,760
catch people exploiting children on

589
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,080
their devices but then changing their

590
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,000
mind because people were concerned about

591
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,679
privacy

592
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,400
privacy and security overlap a lot so

593
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,760
when you think again when you think

594
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,840
about what do you need to stay on top of

595
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,360
if you're in security you've got to stay

596
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,120
on top of privacy issues because they

597
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,159
are absolutely related they're twins

598
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,320
um i think my answer to this question

599
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,440
is that i appreciate apple

600
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,640
trying to make it easier to get

601
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,520
exploited children taken care of as

602
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,039
safely as possible

603
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,880
but i am okay that they changed their

604
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,280
mind if the community came back out and

605
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,000
said the way that apple's going about it

606
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,400
wasn't completely thought through

607
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,240
um i think you could get a hundred

608
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,760
security people in a room and they would

609
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,039
all disagree on whether or not the way

610
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,520
apple architected their apps and their

611
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,880
phones

612
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,400
was the right way to go about it um and

613
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
i don't think you'd ever get complete

614
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,280
consensus about apple's strategy there

615
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,520
however the fact that they have a

616
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,039
strategy they're trying to do the right

617
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,760
thing and they're willing to listen to

618
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
uh community feedback on what they're

619
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,480
doing i think was really important um

620
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,480
and this is the thing about working in

621
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,559
security there are no

622
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,240
there is no um

623
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,159
rule book there's no generally accepted

624
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,480
accounting principles for security or

625
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,720
privacy for that matter we're making it

626
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,440
up as we go along and the things that

627
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,840
we're choosing to do are getting shaped

628
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,240
by the organizations and societies that

629
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,840
we're doing it within

630
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,039
um so being able to communicate your

631
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,480
position

632
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,480
and be able to

633
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,520
um

634
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,120
adjust as necessary is a piece of being

635
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,240
able to live and breathe and exist well

636
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,440
in the cyber security sphere so thank

637
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,039
you very much for that question

638
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,440
so i've thrown out a lot

639
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
but there's more so

640
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,679
those were the four basic things of no

641
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,760
matter where you are in your cyber

642
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,679
security journey from a career

643
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,360
perspective you're going to need those

644
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,200
four things

645
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,280
but some of the questions that i get go

646
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,080
a little bit further than that so

647
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,640
uh one of the first questions i get and

648
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,880
this is from people trying to break into

649
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,640
security but also people who are in

650
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,840
security should i have a degree

651
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,880
in cyber security or should i have a

652
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,039
certification and if so what

653
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,799
certification should i get this is a

654
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,760
really common question

655
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,480
there are lots of certifications out

656
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,280
there

657
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,919
by the way some of them are super

658
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,400
technical and focused on a certain kind

659
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,080
of technology so cisco has

660
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,240
certifications for using cisco equipment

661
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,559
but general networking

662
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,120
cyber security principles as well

663
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,400
some certifications uh like the issa

664
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,400
certifications or even the isc squared

665
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,000
cissp which is probably

666
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
the most popular certification in the

667
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,360
industry

668
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,960
arguably

669
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,840
um

670
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,679
those are more generalist kinds of

671
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,840
certifications so

672
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,200
um

673
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,720
you could you have your pick of what

674
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,400
kind of certifications here's the thing

675
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
about certification so they're really

676
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,720
quick to do in terms of

677
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,320
going through a class or reading the

678
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,559
material and taking the exam the

679
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,799
certifications that are worth anything

680
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,320
from a career perspective also require a

681
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,799
service element usually anywhere from

682
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,400
two to five years

683
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,320
to be able to show and demonstrate that

684
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,120
you've worked in those functional areas

685
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,600
so they're quick to do the background

686
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,960
work but they do take longer to achieve

687
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,520
actually than some degrees do so

688
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,840
something to think about there

689
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,039
there is a sense that certifications

690
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,880
will help you with understanding a

691
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,520
concept but not necessarily mastery of

692
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,240
it

693
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,000
although there is some criticism of

694
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,080
degrees to the same for the same purpose

695
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,760
being able to

696
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,159
do certifications though is a useful way

697
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,880
of keeping up with new things so if you

698
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,720
want to learn more about cloud security

699
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,200
for example going to the cloud security

700
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,880
alliance and seeing what kind of

701
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,360
information they include in their csa

702
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,200
certification

703
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,520
can help you as a roadmap for your own

704
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,760
self-paced learning for example so

705
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,440
certifications can be really useful that

706
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,400
way

707
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
degrees on the other hand they can be

708
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,840
long to do if you're doing a four-year

709
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,240
degree as an undergrad or maybe a

710
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,880
graduate certainly a phd degree

711
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,919
there is a complaint in the industry

712
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,279
that uh degrees are more theoretical

713
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,039
than practical

714
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,000
and it takes a longer time to change the

715
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,240
content of a degree so it's hard to stay

716
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,640
current with current technology i'm

717
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,320
actually going to disagree with that not

718
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,000
just because i worked and i still work

719
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
at ohio state as a teacher but i think

720
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,400
there it doesn't matter what technology

721
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,159
you're learning is it's going to be

722
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,600
changing this is the nature of

723
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,480
technology i think being able to apply

724
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,960
theory to the technology is the core

725
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,480
learning that you get out of a degree

726
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,400
and that will serve you no matter where

727
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,880
you go what you do

728
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,799
i would also say that degrees are

729
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,120
typically not required for entry level

730
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,679
jobs so if you're looking to get into

731
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,919
security as fast as you can having a

732
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,039
degree

733
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,679
may not help you as much there as

734
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,520
perhaps a certification or even a boot

735
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,760
camp on the other hand if you're going

736
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,919
to want to progress inside a security to

737
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,400
a mid or a senior level role you are

738
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,559
probably going to need a for or a

739
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,400
postgraduate degree

740
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
so sort of questions of where you are on

741
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,559
your journey now whether a certification

742
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,720
or a degree is immediately useful

743
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,760
um

744
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,480
some questions have popped up should

745
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,400
companies pay ransoms and isn't it going

746
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,760
to encourage more ransomware attacks um

747
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,080
oh there's a lot out there

748
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,720
there was a paper that was written

749
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
recently from the ransomware task force

750
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,320
that talked about some of the issues

751
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,159
around ransomware and you i'd encourage

752
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,440
you to read it

753
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,360
here's the reality

754
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,679
if you're a business leader

755
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,919
and you don't have a good way of

756
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,640
recovering from ransomware and you are

757
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,559
faced with either your company going

758
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,960
under or people dying because that's

759
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,320
certainly a potential outcome for

760
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,600
ransomware

761
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,360
or paying a ransom

762
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,320
you're going to pay the ransom so

763
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,760
will it encourage more ransomware

764
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,279
attacks if you do

765
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,399
absolutely

766
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,200
right but every decision to pay a ransom

767
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,039
or not is usually made in the heat of

768
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,279
battle we can do tabletop exercises

769
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,559
ahead of time

770
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,919
to

771
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,760
decide whether or not

772
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,159
you know what in this scenario would

773
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,720
what decisions would we need to make to

774
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,200
make a decision to pay a ransom but when

775
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,880
a company's back is against the wall

776
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,320
they're either going to

777
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,880
go under because they need the data that

778
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,039
they don't have access to anymore

779
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,279
or somebody there's going to be some

780
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,679
physical harm they are going to pay they

781
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,200
are going to pay um and that's why even

782
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,520
the fbi and cease that they're

783
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,960
discouraging payment they would

784
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,279
certainly like you to report to them if

785
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,960
you're going to pay so that they can do

786
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,480
what they can to try and track those

787
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,600
payments

788
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,320
um but people are going to pay and it's

789
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,399
the right business decision in the

790
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,320
moment to make if they're going to pay

791
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,200
it

792
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,360
um and to the second question that's in

793
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,440
the q a around what cyber threats keep

794
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,240
me up awake at night i am less concerned

795
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,559
about data theft

796
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,799
there's some caveats on that i am more

797
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,120
concerned about availability risks so i

798
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,360
am concerned about ransomware

799
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,919
i am concerned about any kind of cyber

800
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,440
attack that's going to have a physical

801
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,640
implication to critical infrastructure i

802
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,039
i worry about that quite significantly i

803
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,840
certainly did while i was at ohio state

804
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,200
but even talking to customers of cisco

805
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,640
right now who are in critical

806
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,039
infrastructure industries it and

807
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,240
manufacturing even it's a big problem so

808
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,480
availability is definitely something

809
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,440
that i keep an eye on

810
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,840
um

811
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,320
so alex had a question around

812
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,120
where should privacy engineers exist in

813
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,720
oh sorry about that existing

814
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,039
organizations

815
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,840
and do they belong in a security office

816
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,720
and you're right sometimes privacy folks

817
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,399
get lumped in with it folks and

818
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,559
sometimes in the security office

819
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,919
and sometimes there are competing

820
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,240
priorities so one of the things about

821
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,640
security privacy even

822
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,240
is that there's not a predefined way of

823
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,080
doing it and

824
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,080
what we find is organizations will come

825
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,399
to a conclusion about the best place to

826
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,480
put something based on their own risk

827
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,240
profile their own risk appetite what

828
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,399
they want to do

829
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,399
theoretically i would tell you that

830
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,399
security people security leaders should

831
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,480
be in the c-suite they should be talking

832
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,720
to the board all the time

833
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
they should not be reporting to the cio

834
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,320
they should be as close to the top of

835
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,200
the organizational chain as possible

836
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,520
that's my preference i think that's also

837
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,000
true for privacy i don't think privacy

838
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,240
and security are the same things i think

839
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,720
they're adjacent spaces but they're

840
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,120
partners and so for whatever i say for

841
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,279
security i think there's an equivalency

842
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,240
in the in the privacy space

843
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,880
but the reality of doing security and

844
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,279
privacy in an organization is that the

845
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,360
answer is you need to be wherever you

846
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,360
can be most effective and in some

847
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,840
organizations that's reporting to the

848
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,960
cio or if you're in the privacy space

849
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,520
reporting to the cso or reporting to the

850
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,960
head of legal

851
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,840
it a lot of it will depend on the

852
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,320
ability of individuals in the role to

853
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,960
influence the rest of the organization

854
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,720
influence the organization to change

855
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
their culture but also to free up money

856
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,080
to do

857
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,159
cyber security and privacy activities

858
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:06,960
so

859
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,159
thinking about do you want to be a

860
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,240
single contributor or a manager if you

861
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,640
go to be a manager that influencing

862
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,600
skill

863
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,000
is really important right it's

864
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,240
influencing the people who report to you

865
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,399
so that you get their best work out of

866
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,640
them and that they feel supported and

867
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,120
that they're doing good work but also

868
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,240
influencing the rest of the organization

869
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,000
so if you're going to be a manager or

870
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,159
any kind of thought leader in the

871
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,519
organization

872
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,279
you may need to move away from being a

873
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,760
technical sme and be spend a subject

874
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,240
matter expert and be spending a lot more

875
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,960
of your time in the psychology spaces of

876
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,159
influence

877
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,120
and

878
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,480
and coercion in some places so

879
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,799
thinking the skills to be a manager and

880
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,640
the skills to be a technical single

881
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,960
contributor are very different

882
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,760
and

883
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,600
uh people in their career path have a

884
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,760
tendency to say

885
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,960
at some point i'm going to become a

886
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,640
manager because that's the obvious thing

887
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,440
to go up the ladder of a career and i

888
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,360
would suggest you that you don't do that

889
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,960
if you're a technical person and you

890
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,200
like tech stay a single contributor and

891
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,679
work in places that give you authority

892
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,840
as a single contributor if you like

893
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,480
working with people and you like being

894
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,880
able to have a team have a team depend

895
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,760
on you

896
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,080
be able to influence in that way then be

897
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,080
a manager but they are two completely

898
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,240
different things

899
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,519
um

900
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,279
let's see

901
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,279
it takes a concerted effort for our hr

902
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,360
to agree that a privacy and security

903
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,120
position at a uni doesn't at least need

904
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,679
a ba yes i know it's really hard for

905
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,440
universities to say

906
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,640
you don't need a ba or a bs

907
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,320
in order to do a job like this but

908
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,559
we got around it in in my old role by

909
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,960
saying we want a degree or equivalent

910
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,840
experience and that seemed to give hr

911
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,760
enough wiggle room to be able to do

912
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,039
something different

913
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,360
but it doesn't always work that way and

914
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
so the reality is if you're going to

915
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
require a bachelor's degree particularly

916
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,840
for entry level roles

917
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,200
you're just going to have to expect that

918
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,799
you're going to have less candidates and

919
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,640
that's a problem for us already as an

920
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,399
industry right

921
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,320
so just think about that

922
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,159
um

923
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,000
i do want to point out what i would be

924
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,640
remiss if i didn't say security brings

925
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,360
with it its own kind of stress

926
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,120
every job is stressful and there's

927
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,960
positive stress and negative stress but

928
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,640
when i think about negative stress and

929
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,720
security there's a few things that are

930
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,519
unique about this industry one is

931
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,440
at the moment this will change over time

932
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
but at the moment a lot of people

933
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,279
outside the security or the privacy

934
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,240
world

935
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,039
don't really understand it and so a lot

936
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,080
of the stress comes from

937
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,159
misunderstandings

938
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,240
it comes from suspicion it comes from

939
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,360
other people devaluing what it is you're

940
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,559
trying to do

941
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,519
that adds security stress

942
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,120
whether you're a single contributor or

943
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,640
you're a manager

944
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,440
so that's something to know the second

945
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,760
thing is there is a time factor that

946
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,560
goes along with risk so security people

947
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,520
know

948
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,599
that in order to prepare

949
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,399
for ransomware or whatever the threat of

950
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,199
the day is it's going to take time it's

951
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,119
going to take time to deploy an email

952
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,119
security solution or a multi-factor

953
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,079
authentication solution or whatever

954
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,239
business process changes you need to

955
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,399
implement in order to protect against

956
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,199
that threat

957
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,800
the people making decisions about

958
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,960
funding and about what projects should

959
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,000
come through

960
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,520
don't think that threat is going to

961
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,599
happen today they might intellectually

962
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,879
understand that at some point in the

963
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,399
future it could happen but it's probably

964
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,079
not urgent and they've probably got

965
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,560
something more urgent that needs funding

966
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,960
so this time factor there's going to be

967
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,879
a disconnect between security people

968
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,280
saying we've got to start now

969
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,200
and non-security people saying no no

970
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,560
we've got more important things to do

971
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,119
right now don't bother me so there that

972
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,280
creates some stress

973
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,800
um and related to that security is often

974
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,760
unless you are in a security company uh

975
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,359
it's seen as an indirect business

976
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,599
function so like any indirect business

977
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,920
function any support function it tends

978
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,400
to get deprioritized so

979
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,200
handling security stress

980
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,599
um is you've got to take those factors

981
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,119
into account

982
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,040
so how do you think about doing that

983
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,480
first of all take care of yourself all

984
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,880
the normal things diet exercise sleep

985
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,200
sleep sleep sleep

986
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,800
getting time away where you're not

987
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,960
thinking about security or privacy

988
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,800
take care of yourself first

989
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,720
the second thing is teach the people

990
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,680
around you around about what security is

991
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,760
to help minimize those misunderstandings

992
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,920
again we go back to why do you do

993
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,079
security why is security important to

994
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:52,800
you

995
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,400
educate the people around you who are

996
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
not security people so they understand

997
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,160
where you're coming from it will help

998
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,480
minimize some of those things

999
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
network can you tell here are some of

1000
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,520
those

1001
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,359
common themes to get support and good

1002
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,440
ideas from other people doing security

1003
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,119
in higher ed is different than doing

1004
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,440
security and financial services or

1005
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,880
retail or manufacturing or in the united

1006
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,280
states compared to in hong kong

1007
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,200
everything's got its unique flavor

1008
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,640
you're going to need a network of people

1009
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,520
to help you think through what will work

1010
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,079
in your particular space

1011
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,560
and lastly keep the value of security

1012
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,119
aligned to the business don't just use

1013
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,440
fud which is fear uncertainty and doubt

1014
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,599
don't use that to try and talk about

1015
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,119
security be value and positively driven

1016
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,200
as opposed to negatively and fearfully

1017
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,119
driven that will help

1018
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,119
as you talk about security those ways it

1019
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,320
will help you to minimize your own

1020
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,079
stress but it will help other people

1021
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,359
understand it as well

1022
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,839
one of the things we suck at in security

1023
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,040
is we don't tell stories well enough

1024
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
usually i'm good at making vast

1025
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,040
generalizations

1026
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,880
typically we have a tendency to want to

1027
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,640
lead with data

1028
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,480
and metrics and we've been it's been

1029
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
pounded into our heads that we need to

1030
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,640
lead with data and metrics and i will

1031
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,480
tell you we shouldn't

1032
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,160
we should be leading with the business

1033
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,000
value of what we're doing we should be

1034
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,640
leading with stories around how

1035
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,560
implementing security will help the

1036
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,520
institution or the business grow

1037
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,400
um particularly in higher ed you never

1038
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,520
start with the data because you're

1039
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,280
surrounded by phds and all they want to

1040
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,000
do is criticize your methodology without

1041
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,440
they sort of miss the forest for the

1042
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,800
trees so start with the story first lead

1043
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,440
with images of what you're trying to

1044
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,000
achieve you're trying to achieve you

1045
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,400
know a better technology stack or you're

1046
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,760
trying to achieve

1047
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,839
secure distance learning or you're

1048
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,839
trying to achieve

1049
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,320
a

1050
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,839
well-managed merger and acquisition if

1051
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,320
you're into an m a kind of industry

1052
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,079
what is it that the business is trying

1053
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,119
to do and how can security support that

1054
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,079
be future focused so

1055
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,760
we have a tendency and security to say

1056
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,200
do you remember that target breach that

1057
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,119
happened in 2015 like if someone tells

1058
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,320
me about the target breach again i'm

1059
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,480
going to smack them or solar winds

1060
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,320
happened at christmas time we don't want

1061
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,760
solarwinds

1062
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,839
it's important to learn from previous

1063
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,240
lessons but when you're talking about

1064
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,960
trying to do security in an organization

1065
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,480
you've got to talk about the future

1066
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,000
there's got to be an inspiring vision

1067
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
it could be something as simple as less

1068
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,320
help desk tickets because somebody has

1069
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,800
trouble logging into a system

1070
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,960
but it's going to be future focused and

1071
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,160
it's going to be something that the rest

1072
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,760
of the organization can get on board

1073
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,480
with so telling stories is important

1074
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,400
if you don't tell stories

1075
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,560
if you don't control the narrative

1076
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,640
somebody else will and typically the

1077
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,640
narratives that non-security people say

1078
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,440
is security is scary it's about

1079
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,280
compliance because you will end up on

1080
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,119
the front page of pick the newspaper of

1081
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,079
choice as a bad thing happening to you

1082
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,839
and you don't want that to happen it's a

1083
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,440
reputational risk

1084
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,920
and the reality is security is just

1085
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,079
another risk that an organization has

1086
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,200
and it can be managed and the impact of

1087
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,520
cyber events can be mitigated and it can

1088
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,400
be done calmly and professionally

1089
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,359
and

1090
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,560
well

1091
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,320
if we can get through covert we can get

1092
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,640
through cyber security events but we

1093
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,160
have to control that narrative because

1094
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,400
if we don't tell that story

1095
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,720
someone will tell a worse story and

1096
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,400
that's just not any good for anybody

1097
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,920
leads to security stress

1098
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,480
so the last question

1099
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,040
that um i deal with in the book

1100
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,800
is where do you go

1101
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,920
um

1102
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,160
as a leader

1103
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,119
when you're done being a security person

1104
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,560
leading a team

1105
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,160
and this is a question i think all of us

1106
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,280
have

1107
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,960
at some point in our careers we're sort

1108
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,720
of like well why are we here and once

1109
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,320
we're not here what do we want people to

1110
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,079
remember us for

1111
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,440
um so thinking about

1112
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,319
it's not about what you do it's um

1113
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,160
it's about how you do it it's about how

1114
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,160
you make people feel it's about whether

1115
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,319
or not people feel that you are

1116
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,040
trustworthy and dependable

1117
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,480
and reliable and earnest

1118
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,720
it's a question of do you want to have

1119
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,720
an impact just on your company and

1120
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,720
that's fine or do you want to have an

1121
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,680
industry impact and grow the profession

1122
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,839
potentially in the security space

1123
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,680
there's lots of ways to think about

1124
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,319
leaving a legacy

1125
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,000
i had a problem when i went from

1126
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,640
jpmorgan to ohio state what i built at

1127
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,200
jp morgan sort of blew away in the wind

1128
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,359
it changed because of organizational

1129
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,760
changes but because i left a lot of what

1130
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,599
we were doing was sort of based on the

1131
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,520
force of my personality

1132
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,200
and i was really dissatisfied with that

1133
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
i worked for 10 years at jpmorgan and to

1134
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,280
have that just sort of blow away a

1135
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,200
little bit in the wind was wasn't that

1136
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,599
bad but how it felt

1137
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,800
was not satisfying so at ohio state i

1138
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,720
wanted to make sure that when i left i

1139
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,720
was leaving something behind it people a

1140
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,560
few years from now even could go back

1141
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,599
and say

1142
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,240
yeah helen made a difference and that

1143
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,319
was really important to me and i find in

1144
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,040
security we all have a tendency to want

1145
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,440
something like that so

1146
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,760
whether you're starting your career

1147
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,520
in the middle of it or getting to the

1148
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,440
end of it think about this question you

1149
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,960
know what what do you want people to

1150
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,800
remember about the work that you've done

1151
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,079
in your role

1152
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,800
in your company in your industry

1153
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,880
and give some thought to that as well

1154
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,319
so

1155
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,400
that's all i have at the moment thank

1156
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,160
you very much for everyone's questions

1157
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
so far i'm happy to take further

1158
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,319

i'm going to stop sharing this bath and

1164
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,480
we'll jump into questions

1165
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,040
all right i lost bear was he there

1166
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,920

i i had difficulty getting uh the right

1168
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,000
the right button to come up no problem

1169
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,319
so

1170

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,000
have we gone through all the q a that

1172
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,880
there was one about

1173
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,520
what what kind of threats keep you up at

1174
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,400
night yeah

1175
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,610
yeah i think you know

1176
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:42,960
[Music]

1177
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,720
there is certainly still in the security

1178
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,560
industry there's still certainly a

1179
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,720
concern around

1180
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,640
um data theft

1181
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,480
i know i said i don't care about that so

1182
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,960
much and i actually don't but most

1183
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,800
people in the security space still do

1184
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,440
care about data theft and and the one

1185
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,280
caveat i would say is

1186
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,440
i do worry about data theft where it's

1187
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,079
intellectual property that may end up in

1188
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,920
the wrong hands and i think there are

1189
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,359
data elements

1190
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,440
and data sources that put out of context

1191
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,720
or put into the wrong hands could be

1192
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,200
super damaging so i do worry about that

1193
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,480
kind of theft

1194
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,119
um but i'm i'm less worried about social

1195
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,200
security numbers and dates of birth and

1196
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,960
mother's maiden names and all the sort

1197
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,880
of the things that privacy regulations

1198
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,720
care about because frankly everybody's

1199
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,400
data is sort of floating out in the dark

1200
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,640
web somewhere by now anyway like i think

1201
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,960
the risk of damage from that kind of

1202
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,079
theft

1203
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,720
is way less these days

1204
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,119
maybe healthcare records i might put

1205
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,359
into a slightly different category but

1206
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,079
in terms of real damage i am worried

1207
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,400
about availability and i'm also worried

1208
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,760
about especially in the research

1209
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,200
environment i'm worried about data

1210
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,160
integrity i worry that somebody's data

1211
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,839
that they're doing

1212
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,319
covered vaccine research on might be

1213
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,560
compromised without them knowing about

1214
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,480
it and then you know they they come out

1215
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,640
with a vaccine based on faulty data and

1216
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,640
you know again people are seriously

1217
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,520
injured

1218
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,800
that kind of thing really worries me

1219
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,280
i think uh the trend of

1220
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,599
uh malware gangs

1221
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,599
right ransomware as a service

1222
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,240
where they are now combining both ransom

1223
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,280
of the

1224
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,920
data and

1225
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,520
selling out your data to the highest

1226
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,200
bidder

1227
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,200
fits in that category right especially

1228
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,800
intellectual property

1229
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,640
i think that's right i mean

1230
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,720
private industry that that doesn't deal

1231
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,480
with research and and sort of the

1232
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,960
defense industrial base

1233
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,560
worry about it from an extortion

1234
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,480
perspective and i i think that

1235
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,400
reputational risk is probably worth

1236
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,920
worrying about if you're a board member

1237
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,280
or a ceo

1238
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,000
but yeah again in terms of real damage

1239
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,640
yes it's the sale to the highest bidder

1240
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,880
that again data ending up in the wrong

1241
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,720
hands that that i think could be really

1242
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,640
problematic

1243
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,680
i don't think enough firms understand

1244
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,880
that

1245
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,200
information about oh for instance their

1246
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,720
overhead rate or how they're going to

1247
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,359
bid on contracts can be very damaging if

1248
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,960
it gets into the wrong hands that's

1249
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,200
right because it can yeah business in a

1250
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,119
very bad way yeah

1251
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,240
i'm actually

1252
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,920
encouraged by what's coming out of the

1253
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,640
federal government at the moment i'm

1254
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,240
you know i think we've for a long time

1255
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,520
we've been critical of the federal

1256
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,040
government for having a very splintered

1257
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,319
approach to cyber security it feels like

1258
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,599
they're starting to get a little more

1259
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,280
organized and a little more structured

1260
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,880
and i think that will help not just the

1261
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,880
federal government or the people that

1262
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,520
sell to them but the whole ecosystem so

1263
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,440
i'm

1264
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,960
there's some there's some glimmers of

1265
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,800
hope coming out of the feds at the

1266
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,319
moment as far as i'm concerned so i'm

1267
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,960
watching that space very carefully too

1268
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,839
right

1269
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,680
now we have an interesting question here

1270
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,680
i'm not quite sure what's meant by it

1271
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,079
said is there a fine line between spying

1272
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,520
and data theft

1273
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,480
and

1274
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,119
by spying i'm i'm assuming it means

1275
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,359
espionage

1276
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,200
let's consider it political espionage

1277
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,480
answer it that way yeah

1278
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,560
i

1279
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,079
think that

1280
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,400
i think it's a venn diagram i think you

1281
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,400
can spy for the purpose of stealing data

1282
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,960
and we see that all over the place um

1283
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,960
but i think you can spy for for other

1284
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,240
purposes as well so i'm so i i think

1285
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,079
there is an overlap between the two but

1286
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,160
it's not a one for one it's how i think

1287
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,000
about that

1288
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,480
yeah both both are illegal right

1289
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,599
yeah

1290
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,480
yes and and the challenge with with both

1291
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,560
is especially right now

1292
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,800
you know you can be doing data theft or

1293
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,520
espionage from anywhere in the world and

1294
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,200
they're typically doing it from places

1295
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,359
that are beyond the reach of the border

1296
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,760
based law systems that we have set up

1297
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,599
and so there is going to need to be some

1298
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,520
international cooperation if we're going

1299
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,520
to really solve this problem

1300
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,359
longer term

1301
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:58,800
and there are certain nation states

1302
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,160
where they're going to protect that kind

1303
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,480
of activity as the nation-state

1304
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,079
activity and we're going to have to deal

1305
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,480
with that in terms of international

1306
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,400
security

1307
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,400
and international diplomacy and

1308
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,280
relations as well

1309
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,800
it's clearly an evolving tool i'm in my

1310
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,119
uh undergraduate cyber security class

1311
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,359
this week i've been talking about the

1312
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,400
legal system and the reach of law and

1313
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,319
explaining that if they work at security

1314
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,800
at all or even if they don't

1315
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,240
these kinds of issues are going to have

1316
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,280
a big impact on their careers

1317
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,599
yeah and there's also

1318
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,000
you know the the governments of the

1319
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,559
world are slowly waking up to the fact

1320
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,680
that they can't apply old style physical

1321
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,000
controls to digital data

1322
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,839
so there's still

1323
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,920
as companies just trying to do business

1324
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,160
in a global economy there's a lot of

1325
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,240
regulation around data not being able to

1326
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,760
leave the borders of the country you

1327
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,680
know if you do a backup in germany the

1328
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,440
backup's got to stay in germany if

1329
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,960
you're in singapore it's got a state in

1330
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,000
singapore

1331
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,760
and that really gets in the way of

1332
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,000
having an international footprint of

1333
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,400
international resiliency being able to

1334
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,640
send data across borders but this is

1335
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,800
where the regulations still sit in a lot

1336
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,440
of cases and they haven't quite caught

1337
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,800
up to it yet

1338
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,319
so it makes just operating really hard

1339
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,559
and it tends to fall to the security and

1340
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,720
the privacy teams to

1341
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,359
police that within an organization so if

1342
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:28,800
you're working in security and privacy

1343
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,000
you're going to be dealing with these

1344
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,160
questions of data sovereignty

1345
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,200
a lot

1346
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,640
and it's not about

1347
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,280
the tech of it it's really more about

1348
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,400
the law and compliance of it so

1349
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,520
again

1350
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,319
more job security for us right yeah well

1351
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,680
sometimes they have to translate into

1352
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,800
security like

1353
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,040
if you're going to go to the cloud where

1354
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,119
exactly does the cloud reach that's

1355
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,359
right

1356
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,559
yes

1357
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,079
well i'm filling this in because

1358
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,160
nobody's asking questions and

1359
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,880
i think these are interesting

1360
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,240
interesting concepts that you can

1361
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,240
comment on oh there's one

1362
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,680
there's a lot of concern about election

1363
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,680
integrity in our country

1364
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,359
what are your thoughts about ensuring

1365
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,280
that our election machines and election

1366
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,280
software are secure and

1367
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,480
and where did we fail if we failed

1368
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,559
oh is that something you've looked at

1369
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:21,680
wow

1370
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,599
yeah not deeply so

1371
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,520
for me i go back to first security

1372
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,359
principles so do you have an audit trail

1373
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,720
for the things that you're trying to do

1374
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,240
in this case the votes that you're

1375
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,079
trying to take i'm actually a big

1376
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,880
proponent still of paper-based trails

1377
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,559
to get around some of the digital

1378
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,800
weirdness but i think that

1379
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,240
i

1380
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,559
i'm i'm interested to see where the

1381
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,559
companies that are doing

1382
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,200
voting machine security are going with

1383
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,440
it i think they've done a lot to improve

1384
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,240
the security of voting

1385
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,160
i think what is interesting though is

1386
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,399
that

1387
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,079
the politics again of

1388
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,920
who can vote and how can they vote

1389
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,200
there's a lot of people that want to be

1390
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,079
able to vote by phone or vote via the

1391
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,079
web and not have to show up at a polling

1392
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,920
place and that kind of thing

1393
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,119
um

1394
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,800
and some of and people are sort of

1395
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,040
couching that in terms of of

1396
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,520
accessibility to polling locations and

1397
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,280
and what that means for minorities and

1398
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,280
others who may not otherwise be able to

1399
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,440
get to a polling location

1400
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,640
so i think there's going to be a big

1401
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,400
national dialogue around what is the

1402
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,760
appropriate medium to vote with um and

1403
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,280
then how do you secure it and i i think

1404
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,520
cesar among others have done a pretty

1405
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,880
good job of making sure that the

1406
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,800
security systems are as secure as they

1407
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,480
can be

1408
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,640
i think we've seen a lot of auditing

1409
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,800
happening of voting

1410
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,839
machines but not seeing a whole bunch of

1411
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,400
evidence of of wide scale weirdness in

1412
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,520
the voting

1413
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,520
process actually

1414
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,880
yeah i i'll just throw in here uh i put

1415
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,960
a link in the chat

1416
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,960
to verify voting

1417
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,200
i'm on the advisory board and it's a

1418
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,839
nonpartisan uh neutral

1419
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,800
organization for securing the vote

1420
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,960
and as you said the idea of what's known

1421
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,359
as a risk limiting audit

1422
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:16,000
is key to

1423
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,559
a lot with elections you can certainly

1424
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,240
have a count on the machines but having

1425
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,359
a paper trail and then doing a random

1426
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,440
audit to make sure that it matches the

1427
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,880
electronic

1428
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,280
uh results yep is a way of securing that

1429
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,200
but as you also noted there

1430
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,160
there are political issues around who

1431
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,960
should be allowed to vote how how much

1432
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,480
do we

1433
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,720
verify who they are

1434
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,480
what obstacles do we put in place or how

1435
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,880
convenient do we make it i will note

1436
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,559
that there are several states that for

1437
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,960
years have done nothing other than vote

1438
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,559
by man

1439
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,960
alaska is one of them uh i believe

1440
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,040
colorado is one

1441
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:57,839
and

1442
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:01,520
they've they've not had problems

1443
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,640
but it is being exploited as a

1444
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,960
political issue by some people

1445
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,160
to claim that it's it's somehow a uh

1446
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,880
easily falsified and and it's not

1447
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,800
right mechanisms are well understood

1448
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,839
which is i think a good

1449
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:20,800
um stand in for a lot of

1450
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,559
security right that

1451
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,640
we we have people who

1452
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,599
vendors

1453
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,599
who sell solutions for things that

1454
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,079
aren't really problems

1455
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,559
and there's lots

1456
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,160
cisco's not one of them but of course

1457
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,760
not right

1458
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,280
um

1459
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,160
and and so we uh we need to do a better

1460
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,879
job there of um

1461
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,040
yeah i i do you know the the security

1462
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,000
vendor industry is is very hot at the

1463
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,680
moment there are a lot of vendors coming

1464
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,359
into the space from a start-up

1465
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,839
perspective i do think there is still

1466
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,680
room for a lot of new vendors who are

1467
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,000
working on interesting things but i

1468
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,280
don't think the industry is really

1469
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,800
normalized yet and and what we do find

1470
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,160
um so

1471
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,720
so cisco did a security outcome study in

1472
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,000
2020

1473
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,520
that was also uh the subject of an rsa

1474
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,240
keynote at last year's rsa conference

1475
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,640
that wendy neither keynoted on

1476
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,079
um

1477
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,000
the gist of the security outcome study

1478
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,640
was we did a double-blind survey

1479
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,480
where we interviewed

1480
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,640
um or a company on behalf of cisco who

1481
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,319
didn't say it was cisco interviewed

1482
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,079
about 3 000 companies and that we were

1483
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,920
trying to work out what practices led to

1484
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,079
a good security outcome

1485
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,480
and the gist was if they did a good tech

1486
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,760
refresh

1487
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,280
which has really less to do with

1488
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,960
security and more just to do with it

1489
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,880
management but if they had a good tech

1490
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,359
refresh and security tools that were

1491
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,040
integrated with that technology to

1492
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,240
enable visibility combined with decent

1493
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,880
incident response um threat intelligence

1494
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,200
and disaster recovery

1495
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,520
the outcomes were pretty good right and

1496
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,240
and that's basic security blocking and

1497
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,359
tackling that's been around for forever

1498
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,480
right

1499
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,880
um so yeah there's still room for the

1500
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,000
novel and the innovative to come around

1501
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,559
on the edges but for 90 of the

1502
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,440
organizations who are just trying to do

1503
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,280
something else other than security but

1504
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,319
still be secure those basic you know

1505
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,160
stay up to date with your technology

1506
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,240
keep stuff patched

1507
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,200
um and make sure that your security

1508
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,040
structure can see what's going on in the

1509
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,000
environment is pretty straightforward

1510
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,680
it's not that hard

1511
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,280
so you don't think we should all run out

1512
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,359
and get ai enabled blockchain to solve

1513
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:44,000
all our problems

1514
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,000
interested at looking at it but i

1515
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,240
haven't seen a use case yet that i think

1516
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,160
applies in the security space that's for

1517
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,839
sure ai maybe blockchain not yet i'm

1518
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,280
looking at um

1519
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,359
bring your own identity kinds of things

1520
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,680
like you know can we do some kind of

1521
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,920
immutable identity on the blockchain and

1522
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,680
bring it with us rather than have to

1523
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,480
have every vendor every company every

1524
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,480
bank that we work with have some kind of

1525
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,280
identity management system for customers

1526
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,599
i think is an intriguing concept but i

1527
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,119
don't i think we're a long way away from

1528
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,559
it yet

1529
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:17,920
i'll uh

1530
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,520
i'll toss out we ought to have a

1531
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,000
conversation sometime i i think

1532
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,400
immutable anything is dangerous for a

1533
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,000
number of reasons

1534
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,119
um

1535
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,559
control

1536
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,319
authorized control is more important

1537
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:34,960
than immutability i agree so yes

1538
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,000
well we're not getting any other

1539
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,160
questions we've about

1540
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,960
come down to the bottom of the hour

1541
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,200
this has been incredibly entertaining

1542
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,000
and i hope informative for the audience

1543
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,559
uh you have those of you have been

1544
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,280
listening in have some pointers to some

1545
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,079
books uh foremost being of course

1546
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,480
helen's book that's coming out soon

1547
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,079
uh but uh places to go look

1548
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,520
and to think about i i think really good

1549
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,040
advice about

1550
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,200
what do you want your your future to

1551
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,920
hold what is it you want to accomplish

1552
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,440
and what is it you want your work

1553
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,440
environment to be

1554
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,520
what i try to tell

1555
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,520
junior colleagues i try to tell students

1556
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,559
is

1557
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:20,880
you're not studying for your future this

1558
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,040
is your future right

1559
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,280
don't put off

1560
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,000
uh some of those things that

1561
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,440
this is life

1562
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,280
and and how you live it and how you

1563
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,200
organize it is going to carry over

1564
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,200
and i i think that came through with

1565
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,200
with your discussion as well

1566
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,760
um so folks take it from from at least

1567
