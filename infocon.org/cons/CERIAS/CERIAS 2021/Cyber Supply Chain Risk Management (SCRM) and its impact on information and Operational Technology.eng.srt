1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,159
well thank you uh for the introduction

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,160
and reading off all of those certs it

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,160
may sound hilarious uh when i

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,120
when i hear it back myself uh although i

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,800
do recommend folks if you you know

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,400
you're in this course and you're

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,559
you're thinking about your future check

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,079
out you know some of the certifications

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,199
that are out there

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,279
uh there's a lot of very good ones some

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,520
of them are very specialized uh

12
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,760
and so forth but i actually kind of

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,359
giggled inside when i heard that

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,400
um because i've been on the other end i

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,160
uh and i was a purdue university

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,238
graduate uh i've attended

17
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,680
you know this particular course that you

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,440
guys are in and

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,079
i've spoken in person a few times in the

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:38,559
past

21
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,719
and i wish we could all be there

22
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,040
together i'm used to you know

23
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,879
looking at a folks a smiley room of

24
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,879
smiling faces and so forth

25
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,000
uh but i hope um hope to cover

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,920
any question that you guys might have

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,160
with this with respect to this topic

28
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,280
so i'm going to be speaking on cyber

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,079
supply chain

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,079
risk management or sometimes you'll hear

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,199
what it said is

32
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,119
cyber scrim uh i like to say it out as

33
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,280
scrm or something like that but i've

34
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,360
definitely heard folks in the industry

35
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,400
call it scrim

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,240
so if you ever heard that that's kind of

37
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,000
what they're referring to

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,840
and the the really the focus on this

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,080
talk topic is specifically

40
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,759
on its impact on uh information

41
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,320
in operational technology now a lot of

42
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,000
people do talk about

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,479
uh i.t but we are going to have a little

44
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,840
bit of a focus on

45
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,759
operational which are things that we use

46
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,000
in our in our daily lives it can be

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,439
embedded or

48
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,079
other you know scada type systems or

49
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,640
manufacturing and so forth

50
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,680
and so on now just disclaimer um

51
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,479
the opinions you know herein are my own

52
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,680
and do not

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,920
necessarily represent the views of my

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,799
employer

55
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,720
so i will give you from my own uh

56
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,399
personal experience

57
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,719
and as best of you know guidance i can

58
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,719
possibly provide at least off the top of

59
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,360
my head

60
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,360
without breaking out a book or reading

61
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,880
something specific

62
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,399
all right um so i always like to kind of

63
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,040
do these

64
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,280
um things up here uh in the front that

65
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,959
are kind of like abstract so

66
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,360
if you kind of read it it's kind of the

67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,720
too long don't read

68
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,360
uh you know summary of of really what's

69
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,640
going on here

70
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,680
and in in this topic

71
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,080
we are basically looking at the

72
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,400
interdependency that we have

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,879
of of really getting our components and

74
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,560
parts our software and

75
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,440
everything that we do to make a product

76
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,959
from other folks

77
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,640
in fact we find it very unlikely that

78
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,800
folks make every single component

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
right every single line of software even

80
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,640
if it's the compiler itself that is

81
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,080
generating the code

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,200
something is doing something for you uh

83
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,400
and so uh we need to understand what's

84
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,560
going on uh with respect to all that and

85
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:54,959
how

86
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,519
you know how maybe things could creep in

87
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,680
uh potentially

88
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,720
now with respect to uh electronics

89
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,480
uh they're almost entirely nowadays

90
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,080
uh manufactured offshore uh so that may

91
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,760
uh you know if you have various

92
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,360
different um you know

93
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,680
trust uh requirements on things that you

94
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,599
are creating that house to have a

95
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,280
certain you know trusted computing base

96
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,720
or something along that line

97
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,959
uh there's a lot of concern there uh

98
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,519
with respect to that

99
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,040
um in in folks in the past

100
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,280
have you know looked at various

101
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,400
different concerns

102
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,120
and identified identifying things that

103
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360
may have kind of malicious functionality

104
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,879
from parts in which they've

105
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,680
purchased and have them made offshore

106
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,120
brought them back in and say you know

107
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,040
this doesn't exactly the same

108
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,080
as uh what i originally designed you

109
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,400
know

110
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,879
is it malicious is it some extra you

111
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,720
know debug functionality you know what

112
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,400
is this extra thing

113
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,239
uh and so forth um and then

114
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,360
um and so what we're really gonna

115
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,400
um focus in on is a little bit beyond

116
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,799
the

117
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,519
the close the classic um supply chain

118
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,040
risk management which is really more

119
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,920
focused on

120
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,840
you know are we gonna get the product on

121
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,519
time and on budget well we're

122
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,680
specifically looking at the products

123
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,720
that we receive

124
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,478
are they trustworthy do they have you

125
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,160
know extra vulnerabilities

126
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,520
uh and so forth uh and so on

127
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,680
now this is important especially in

128
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,520
areas such as

129
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,720
manufacturing uh you know and

130
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,639
where we have things are being tested

131
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,560
and and created with

132
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,040
automated processes and automated tools

133
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
and so forth and we want to see

134
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,440
how my cyber supply chain risk

135
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,240
management

136
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,479
affect uh what they're developing

137
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,520
now this is a statement um we say a lot

138
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,800
and uh just kind of note that uh if

139
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,479
you're a big company you've got a big

140
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,080
budget you've got a lot of cyber

141
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,240
security folks on staff

142
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,720
but if you really want to attack that

143
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,400
company you really attack

144
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,840
their suppliers so if you can go

145
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,479
maybe to someone who doesn't have as

146
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,320
much money or much funding or as much

147
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,320
funding as some of the bigger companies

148
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,800
it might be easier to attack that and

149
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,080
kind of look at that

150
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,560
with respect to one's attack surface as

151
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,520
ways that

152
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,560
um things might be entering into uh

153
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,479
their products

154
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,479
so uh just kind of talk about some

155
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,880
recent uh supply chain attacks

156
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,160
um this was uh from about a year ago

157
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,919
in that um the fbi was warning that

158
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,400
that there was lots of ongoing top

159
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,160
attacks with respect to

160
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,720
uh supply and chain companies and what

161
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,080
they're trying to do

162
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,880
is um look at folks that are supporting

163
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,120
the industrial control systems for

164
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,240
energy and trying to

165
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,320
you know get products in there such as

166
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,240
remote access trojan

167
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,520
uh if i can control your you know your

168
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,080
product

169
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,560
now i'm not covering solar winds if

170
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,919
anyone is familiar with real

171
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,639
real recent history but if i can get a

172
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,440
product

173
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,800
um you know inside of the way that you

174
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,000
you know run your system then perhaps uh

175
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,280
i might be able to

176
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,160
um you know subvert what you're doing um

177
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,880
and so forth

178
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,840
all right now this was a a big one from

179
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,120
a few years ago

180
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,440
and i'm kind of going to talk around

181
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,120
this particular subject

182
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,400
and um the big hack was a huge

183
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,520
uh article that came out from bloomberg

184
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,080
and bloomberg uh reported on this and

185
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,039
basically said

186
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,039
that um a a small little chip and that's

187
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:43,440
kind of

188
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,600
a depiction of of how big you know the

189
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
this how big it is the size of a you

190
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,440
know a grain of rice and that

191
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,639
you know something so small um

192
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,280
you know was designed into particular

193
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,919
boards

194
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,240
and you know that potentially could have

195
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,440
extra functionality

196
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,960
or back door capability or something

197
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,240
that is definitely not wanted right or

198
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
something you didn't design

199
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,440
into your own product and so forth now

200
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,840
it came out a lot of folks did take a

201
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,400
look at this and didn't necessarily find

202
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,280
uh this particular uh grain of rice but

203
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,960
if anyone knows anything about

204
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,080
a micro electronics manufacturing

205
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,440
there's a lot that one can store in that

206
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,440
tiny little space when you hear about

207
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,360
millions of transistors at

208
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,319
you know five microns and and what you

209
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,400
can do with that kind of level you know

210
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,479
things are so so small

211
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,880
it's very easy to add additional

212
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,160
functionality

213
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,440
and and for you know folks that have to

214
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,840
build trusted computing systems and

215
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,960
things that are very

216
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,479
you know secure um you know we have we

217
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,400
always have to worry about this idea

218
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,039
of trusted foundries are things

219
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,240
developed on

220
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,720
shore within the united states or

221
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,479
offshore offshore

222
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,800
outside of united states and there are

223
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,639
very few

224
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,319
trusted foundries within the united

225
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,800
states and they seem to be dwindling

226
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,280
every year uh there uh every time i

227
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,319
think that oh

228
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,400
maybe that's it there's no more left uh

229
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
someone uh someone will remind you

230
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,720
oh there's one over here or or so forth

231
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,319
but there isn't there isn't that many

232
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:22,960
places

233
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,120
around at least within the united states

234
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,520
that do

235
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,319
develop the designs in which folks might

236
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,039
do

237
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,159
so if you think you know if you're an

238
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,559
electrical engineer you design out your

239
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,200
board

240
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,360
you say this is exactly what i want you

241
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,120
know what to do i've got my

242
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,839
and gates and or gates and this is all

243
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:42,399
all

244
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,399
perfectly how i would like it to be when

245
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,120
you get back it's very easy for someone

246
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,600
to

247
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
integrate some additional extra

248
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,800
functionality

249
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,120
without you knowing it and it's very

250
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,560
difficult for you to

251
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,519
go about determining whether or not that

252
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,200
additional functionality is in there

253
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,240
whether you're

254
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,839
you'd have to kind of you know start to

255
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,360
de-layer your board

256
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,839
do destructive analysis or if you're

257
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,560
lucky

258
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,800
do non-destructive analysis and and

259
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,240
attempt to determine

260
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,560
how what is the you know the composition

261
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,000
of that board uh and so forth

262
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,200
uh ripple 20 uh came out um right about

263
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,839
the

264
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,519
right right before actually i wrote the

265
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,920
original version of this particular talk

266
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,120
and um it was kind of featured very

267
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,080
heavily at

268
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,160
defcon at least virtually and

269
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,200
with it there was 19 vulnerabilities

270
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,160
that had been

271
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,000
in a tcp library

272
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,240
that are found in many internet of

273
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,279
things

274
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,959
products so if you're an internet of

275
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,720
things vendor

276
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,800
you don't have a lot of costs that

277
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,640
you're going to be able to build into

278
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,279
your product if you can go out and buy

279
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:53,839
uh

280
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,680
some uh feature capability

281
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,279
and it costs you like a penny you're

282
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,640
going to go you're going to go do it

283
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,200
because

284
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,760
it is going to be a lot cheaper for you

285
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,040
in the long run

286
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,160
and in this particular case they were

287
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,360
able to find

288
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,360
19 unknown vulnerabilities in that tcpip

289
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,440
library and one of the interesting

290
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,800
things about it

291
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,399
is one of the the exploits allowed

292
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,920
a cross firewall remote code exploit

293
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,120
in that it was doing a dns request and

294
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,920
that dns request was passed and returned

295
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,320
back and so if you have an industrial

296
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,160
device that just so happened to be

297
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,040
running

298
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,399
uh this uh you know tcp library it's

299
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,240
potential that it could have bypassed

300
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,959
your firewall

301
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,560
got inside your system and have you know

302
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,079
extra functionality you didn't

303
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,760
necessarily want to be there

304
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,560
so things that they've found ripple 20

305
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:50,800
in

306
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,279
you know industrial devices you know

307
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:53,920
building

308
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,880
things like big robotic arms and moving

309
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,279
uh

310
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,560
big manufacturing equipment and so forth

311
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,600
power grids and medical devices which

312
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,959
really scare me

313
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,560
um you know definitely in home devices

314
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,519
so you know cheap you know cameras and

315
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,399
sensors

316
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,200
and those types of things uh and

317
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,600
including of course uh network devices

318
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,079
and things

319
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,480
which we build our own home networks on

320
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,240
and and sometimes small business you

321
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,519
know they use

322
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,839
a lot of these commodity devices to kind

323
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,760
of build just a simple little network

324
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,000
with

325
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,160
a simple little vpn you know connected

326
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,880
to another little network somewhere else

327
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,320
those things run a lot of internet

328
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,440
of things uh capabilities uh

329
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,920
and so forth all right

330
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,760
all right so i'm going to talk about

331
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,040
some of the work that we did

332
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,320
last year with respect to

333
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,519
working with the national institute of

334
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,519
technology and one of the document

335
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,839
documents that they were coming out with

336
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,399
was the nister which is an interagency

337
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,560
report

338
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,800
8276 and it's a title was key practices

339
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,040
on cyber supply chain risk management

340
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,000
observations from industry you know we

341
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,279
like others are

342
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,839
a part of industry and so this is one of

343
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,120
the things that we commented and

344
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,240
collaborated on

345
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,519
with them um and and provided a lot of

346
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,480
you know feedback

347
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,560
with respect to some of the things that

348
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
we might have seen uh

349
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,639
you know in work that looking at a lot

350
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,079
of different customers and

351
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,519
um things along that line so these were

352
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,399
the key

353
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,040
uh summary items that they had now we're

354
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,480
gonna have a second

355
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,959
uh version of this on the next slide

356
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,720
which was the ones that we

357
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,760
recommended but

358
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,240
their first one was established training

359
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,760
on cyber supply chain risk management

360
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,800
it's very common that folks don't always

361
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,920
know all the risks with respect to uh

362
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,720
cyber supply chain risk management and a

363
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,920
lot of folks

364
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,800
with with with respect to scrim in

365
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,519
general

366
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,360
think you know if i buy the product if

367
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,120
it comes to me on time

368
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,320
uh if i do uh you know uh

369
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,440
uh virus scan it's okay there's nothing

370
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,279
there right so that virus scan

371
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,920
you know says it's it's the exactly the

372
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,519
way i thought it was and then let's go

373
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,519
use it in our product and so

374
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,839
establishing a good and detailed

375
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,279
training program

376
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,399
on what that might mean

377
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,880
what are the potential ramifications of

378
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,320
things getting into your

379
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,920
environment whether it's from a hardware

380
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,240
perspective a software perspective

381
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,480
a firmware perspective all of these

382
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,160
types of things establishing that

383
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,720
training

384
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,800
and making sure that everyone is trained

385
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,720
and it's not just your engineers it's

386
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,639
not just your supply chain folks

387
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,199
it can be a wide variety of folks in

388
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,639
program management and

389
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,199
all sorts of folks quality assurance all

390
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,480
of those guys

391
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,440
are all part of the this really the team

392
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,720
that's going to put together

393
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,920
secure systems and training everyone and

394
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,519
having that

395
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,120
is very important uh the establishment

396
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,639
of a formal program

397
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,160
so having folks go about the concept of

398
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,399
really validating your supply chain

399
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,639
making sure that what is it they're

400
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,160
delivering potentially

401
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,199
is exactly what you think it is uh

402
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,720
you know one of the things you'll want

403
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,480
to do is look

404
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,639
at your suppliers and kind of rate them

405
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,040
with respect to the criticality they

406
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,240
might have to

407
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,040
a critical piece of component that you

408
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
might be making so if you're making

409
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,600
something that is you know maybe safety

410
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,320
critical

411
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,120
or you know some other thing that needs

412
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,639
to operate

413
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,880
you want to have a really a little bit

414
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,839
more scrutiny

415
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,519
in that and so you might have a set of

416
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,600
folks that might be a third party

417
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
organization within your own group or

418
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,279
you might outsource

419
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,320
to other folks and have them come in and

420
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,600
kind of validate

421
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,240
what that thing is that you buy and make

422
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,720
sure

423
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,800
that it you know it truly in fact is

424
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,600
what it they says it is

425
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,920
now integrating um supply chain uh

426
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,000
functions across all disciplines

427
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,440
um that kind of gets back a little bit

428
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,959
what i was talking about training in

429
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:13,519
that

430
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,480
it's just it's not just supply chains uh

431
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,600
tasks to ensure

432
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,720
what is purchased is secure it's gonna

433
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,440
involve

434
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,000
folks in engineering it's gonna evolve

435
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,480
you know

436
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,639
really the whole entire product uh cyber

437
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,920
security group

438
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,120
so making sure that everyone is trained

439
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,120
they know what they need to do they're

440
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,279
part of that formal program

441
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,120
uh and making sure that those

442
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
disciplines are all in align to make

443
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,440
sure that what is purchased is really

444
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,480
truly uh what's going to be important to

445
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,240
your product

446
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,880
now knowing and managing your suppliers

447
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,440
so this

448
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,880
is um a set of things where

449
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,320
you're working with your suppliers and

450
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,680
you are kind of monitoring what what

451
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,399
they're doing

452
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,959
making sure that they are not delivering

453
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,040
uh malicious content

454
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,320
let's say that you're part of that

455
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,399
formal program and you do find

456
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,240
um you know an of an issue well

457
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,839
getting to the next one collaborate with

458
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,279
your key suppliers but

459
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,079
collaborate with them and make sure that

460
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,920
that doesn't happen again

461
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,880
and um and so if it does happen again

462
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,440
then

463
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,800
you know making sure that you're

464
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,040
managing that and making sure that maybe

465
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,079
you're looking at

466
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,199
uh supplier redundancy or making sure

467
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,399
that some things are a little bit more

468
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,279
resilient

469
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,120
and how you um both create them

470
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,040
and integrate them into your product

471
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,639
now the collaborate your with your

472
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,240
suppliers uh

473
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,839
is focused on kind of that first

474
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,079
takeaway which is if i'm going to attack

475
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,000
a company i'm going to attack their

476
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,199
suppliers so

477
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,160
it is very important that organizations

478
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,519
collaborate with those

479
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,560
uh suppliers making sure that maybe you

480
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:58,959
know

481
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,360
they they don't have the big it security

482
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,240
budget that

483
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,039
you do and so if you can you know reach

484
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,959
out provide best practices

485
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,599
you know provide uh you know various

486
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,319
different

487
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,640
um you know tactic techniques and

488
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,439
procedures

489
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,400
uh that you see from adversaries um you

490
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,240
know making sure that

491
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,000
uh that they know that if you're a

492
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,240
target perhaps their target too

493
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,640
and you know what you might be doing to

494
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,799
help them bolster their security

495
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,520
maybe it's providing them uh equipment

496
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,400
that maybe they

497
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,640
wouldn't be able to normally afford or

498
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,000
some vpn access or authentication access

499
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
lock help locking down their systems you

500
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
know those types of things is a good way

501
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,960
to

502
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
work with those key suppliers and i

503
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,080
believe a lot of them will

504
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,160
be very receptive to that now if you go

505
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,200
to them and say

506
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,240
you know we demand you be you know we're

507
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,200
talking about cmmc

508
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,520
just a little bit later but cmmc level

509
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,960
five right off the bat

510
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,000
they might say we can't afford that and

511
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,919
that's something you know you want to

512
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,360
consider and help them

513
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,200
along the way and get them to that kind

514
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,960
of level

515
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,480
and then of course you're gonna monitor

516
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,720
them throughout that relationship so

517
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,440
just because it's good on day one does

518
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,320
not mean necessarily that it's good on

519
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,440
the final day and so as you're going

520
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,000
through

521
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,559
uh that relationship that you're making

522
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,679
sure that

523
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,799
uh you know things don't creep up or you

524
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,120
know

525
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,720
things change over time and and so forth

526
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,760
all right so these are um some other

527
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,240
ones

528
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,000
that we had a little bit different uh

529
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,600
has the same theme though um for us

530
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
uh one of the things that we've been

531
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,039
focusing on is

532
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,880
really uh i work a lot in training and

533
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
developing targeted training not just

534
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,000
generic training

535
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,559
but something specific to what that

536
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,760
individual does

537
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,559
on their day in and day their day job

538
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,440
and so that

539
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,080
does get help you got to get familiar

540
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,600
with what they do

541
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,880
and try to determine how does cyber

542
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,679
supply chain

543
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,919
risk management affect this particular

544
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,440
discipline which is going to be

545
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,600
different than say

546
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,960
you know quality is going to be

547
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,640
different than um

548
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,480
maybe purchasing or something like that

549
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,160
so there are certain aspects that they

550
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,440
all want

551
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,600
that is specific to the training that

552
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
they're they're looking for

553
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,840
uh we definitely agreed with the uh

554
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,960
integrating it across

555
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,000
all levels we'll talk about a nist uh

556
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,160
document upcoming another nist document

557
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,520
talking about that

558
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,760
and in course uh establishing that

559
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,160
formal uh program but with that forward

560
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,520
program

561
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,840
having you know clearly defined and

562
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,720
signed off

563
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,600
uh you know policies and procedures by

564
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,280
senior management vice presidents

565
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,240
presidents

566
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,720
uh whoever is you know got the authority

567
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,480
in your program that everyone

568
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,919
from top down is a part and agreeing on

569
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,440
what that formal program is

570
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,400
and and and helps instigate it and make

571
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,080
it a part of how you do

572
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,679
business now of course uh

573
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,520
you may um have defined set of

574
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,559
suppliers that are critical suppliers so

575
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,600
one of the things you'll have to do is

576
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,080
determine which one those might be so

577
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,039
you might have a

578
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,840
like i said a critical process or pro

579
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,559
you know

580
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,200
product that you might be developing it

581
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,840
might be

582
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,880
a sub system in a larger system or

583
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,000
it's a board on you know on

584
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,039
on this uh little chassis or this

585
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,400
embedded device

586
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,880
that that thing right there is the most

587
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,520
critical

588
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,600
aspect of your system other things might

589
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,880
not be as

590
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,080
critical so definitely making sure that

591
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,520
you're working with those that you

592
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,919
feel is most critical and having a

593
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,440
little bit of

594
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,039
extra scrutiny with respect to what that

595
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,720
what that is because that's really what

596
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,960
makes your products so great right

597
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,880
people love your product because this

598
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,400
whiz-bang thing and

599
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,039
if they're a part of that making sure

600
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,159
that they are you know

601
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,200
extra specially taken care of

602
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,799
of course understanding your supply

603
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,080
chain um it is often very difficult to

604
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,799
know

605
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,679
who your supplier supplier suppliers are

606
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,960
and i don't think i could

607
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,080
say supplier supplier suppliers enough

608
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,640
and in fact it can keep going on and on

609
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,120
and on

610
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,280
and if you do any kind of research in

611
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,320
the area of

612
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,799
supply chain risk management or in cyber

613
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:31,679
specifically

614
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,240
you'll find this kind of finger drawing

615
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,799
where

616
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,480
you know one thing leads to another

617
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,840
thing that leads to another thing that

618
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,280
leads to another thing that eventually

619
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,919
gets to

620
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,720
into your system and you'll be surprised

621
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,280
how

622
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,320
how in-depth it might go

623
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,280
um all right let's see some of the other

624
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,880
ones we got on here

625
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,760
you know i definitely collaborate uh

626
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,440
with

627
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,600
i would say really all your suppliers

628
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,760
but if you had to

629
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,440
if you could only afford a little bit

630
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,120
maybe you you do identify

631
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
some key specific ones other ones you

632
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,880
have a certain level of trust

633
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,440
uh that you're working with so making

634
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,159
sure that you're

635
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,600
you know using your funds correctly

636
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,640
now there are various different cases

637
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,200
where you want your products to be

638
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,080
resilient and you also want to have a

639
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,880
resilient

640
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,039
supplier base where you have more than

641
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,120
one supplier or you might have one that

642
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,720
develops it for let's say

643
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,000
arm processors or intel processors they

644
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,240
they might be completely different and

645
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,919
one of the things that we always try to

646
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:36,640
consider

647
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,880
with respect to building secure systems

648
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,400
is what happens

649
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,280
when we get exploited what what is the

650
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,679
resiliency that has to take place

651
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,159
uh with respect to that and it could be

652
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,679
it could involve

653
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,760
buying a component that does this one

654
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,280
thing that is different than another

655
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,000
component

656
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,480
and that resiliency is extraordinarily

657
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,320
uh important

658
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,400
and of course monitor them throughout

659
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,000
your uh throughout the entire

660
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,200
relationship

661
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,320
and uh and really think about that full

662
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,400
life cycle and a lot of people

663
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,120
do tend to forget that eventually things

664
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,039
do get disposed of

665
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,039
we don't want to see things in landfills

666
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,120
with you know special

667
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,760
firmware installed or chips you know

668
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,760
they are disposed of correctly

669
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,640
and data is properly purged and and so

670
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,720
forth

671
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,919
all right so here's some example is

672
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,600
an important things that folks might

673
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,520
want to look at with respect to

674
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,960
providing guidance with respect to

675
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
cyber supply chain risk management and

676
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,120
the biggest one right now

677
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,400
is what's going on uh with the special

678
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,880
pub 800 161

679
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,240
and then additionally i'm going to talk

680
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,000
a little bit about

681
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,520
the recently updated nist special pub

682
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,640
853

683
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,240
uh in the upcoming slides in

684
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,360
the in this specific guidance on

685
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,679
supply chain risk management it is you

686
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,840
know it's kind of listed for federal

687
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,760
information systems and organizations

688
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,039
but a lot of folks

689
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,480
adopt this particular uh

690
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,240
document and methodology now note um

691
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,440
draft one uh is coming uh so i

692
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
i it always cringe every time when i

693
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,039
make a slide and then i see

694
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,360
oh man this hasn't been updated for you

695
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,559
know six years

696
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,600
uh it's coming uh it's not quite out yet

697
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,919
uh the current one still references the

698
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:32,880
older

699
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,240
nist revision but it goes in depth

700
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,440
on looking at your organization

701
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,520
looking at all of those capabilities and

702
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
roles and it does provide

703
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,960
in section 1.7 a methodology for

704
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,600
building this uh this kind of group from

705
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,559
scratch

706
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,080
and so the ic ict is integrated

707
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,919
communications technology which is

708
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,320
basically everything that produces ones

709
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,279
and zeros

710
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,960
so they provide guidance on using

711
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,760
the nist special pub 839 which is

712
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,480
managing

713
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,960
information security risk that's

714
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,559
important because you don't want to

715
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,720
you know spend money on places you know

716
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,919
you don't need to be spending money

717
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,200
that's kind of why i kept bringing up

718
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,799
criticality a little bit

719
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,000
uh determining what's critical uh on how

720
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,640
your

721
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,200
product is going to run and execute and

722
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,799
what really keeps it

723
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,679
working those are the things you want to

724
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,360
focus on so you want to have that kind

725
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,320
of risk

726
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,960
management along the way to ensure that

727
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,080
you are

728
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,320
tackling and going and looking at the

729
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,919
right

730
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,200
right items now um it specifically calls

731
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,799
out how to apply

732
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,799
the nist uh security and privacy

733
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,120
controls which was under nist special

734
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,080
pub 853 revision four

735
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,320
and i added the bracket now revision

736
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,360
five so i do have that in the next slide

737
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,840
uh which i will cover um because they

738
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,640
they did some

739
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,559
interesting things with respect to how

740
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,919
it used to be

741
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,880
uh in the controls document and those of

742
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,240
you aren't familiar

743
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,600
uh with these particular documents

744
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,640
uh the 853 is probably one of the most

745
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,960
famous documents out there in that

746
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,039
people kind of equate that to

747
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,200
security requirements like i might have

748
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,440
access control requirements or

749
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,760
something along that line one of the

750
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,480
sections

751
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,640
in there was specific uh actually it was

752
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,840
a subsection

753
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,960
lee was called sa-12 on

754
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
supply chain risk management so move on

755
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,080
to the next slide

756
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,960
one of the things that they um did is

757
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,520
they pulled that out into a major level

758
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,840
and they kind of you know started to see

759
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,520
what they could do to integrate supply

760
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:45,919
chain

761
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,120
across the document and so they

762
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,520
came up with a supply chain risk

763
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,240
management

764
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,360
family or you'll see it bracketed sr

765
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,559
so you have policies and procedures and

766
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,120
you know various different controls and

767
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,640
it talks about

768
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,919
things that you want to be thinking

769
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,240
about if you're building in um supply

770
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,200
chain now

771
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,520
provenance um pedigree improvements you

772
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,200
know who has it and where

773
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,440
where you know who created it uh and

774
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,360
understanding who created it

775
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,000
um is is extraordinarily important

776
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,520
because it may be

777
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,480
a mom-and-pop shop who wrote some code

778
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,320
base that gets integrated into something

779
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,240
else which then gets integrated

780
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,720
um uh into your products and so if

781
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,440
you're

782
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,440
in the uh you know

783
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,679
if you were looking at the the

784
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,360
vulnerability i was just talking about

785
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,200
um where uh the tcp vulnerability

786
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,960
uh that was us you know a small company

787
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,559
wrote a tcp

788
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,559
library it was integrated into major

789
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,159
operating systems are

790
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,440
more focused on uh embedded type systems

791
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,120
those were integrated into

792
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,080
a targeted board that folks created made

793
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
their product out of it and it got

794
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,840
uh you know brought in and so

795
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,200
in this particular case you would look

796
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,120
at uh you know who had

797
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,240
the ability or and and touch the product

798
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,000
all the way all along along the way

799
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,880
uh the assessment and reviews so

800
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,080
eventually at some point you will have

801
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,240
to assess the work that they're doing

802
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,760
uh i mentioned maybe potentially

803
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,360
utilizing a third party

804
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,960
uh like an internal third party is

805
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
really helpful but if you can

806
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,039
definitely work with them and make sure

807
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,320
that you know when

808
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
you're bringing in let's say source code

809
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,240
from that mom and pop shop

810
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,320
that you might be doing things such as

811
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,000
static code analysis

812
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,559
and running various different tools and

813
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,240
doing it really a full static

814
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,080
application security test

815
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,159
of what is it they're developing you may

816
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,240
also potentially be doing dynamic

817
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,279
analysis

818
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,080
and that dynamic analysis may you know

819
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,279
definitely run the code

820
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,760
in its targeted environment and maybe

821
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,720
fuzz it

822
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,600
uh you know check for you know memory

823
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,279
reads and writes and all of those types

824
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,600
of things and and see how it works in

825
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,399
nominal and off nominal situations uh

826
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,320
and so forth

827
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,000
there's a whole bunch of others on here

828
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,200
i'm not gonna touch on them all but i do

829
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,000
want to recommend folks take a look at

830
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,320
this especially if you are

831
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,760
new to supply chain in

832
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,360
in trying to think of you know what

833
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,159
controls that your programs

834
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,799
uh or companies should be looking at

835
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,679
with respect

836
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,360
to applying to applying to the processes

837
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,399
and things that you're doing

838
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,760
there's a lot of great stuff in here

839
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,520
including that very last one

840
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,720
uh component disposal um now actually

841
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,360
i'm gonna go

842
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,399
back right um up one

843
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,799
authenticity is an extraordinarily uh

844
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,679
important thing i

845
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,200
apologize for skipping it um people have

846
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,640
been creating products

847
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,360
that look nearly identical to other

848
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,399
products in some

849
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,559
cases they actually exceed the

850
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,360
capability of the original product

851
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,120
in these cases they've basically reverse

852
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,640
engineered all of

853
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,399
you know all of the components they've

854
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,760
created their own parts

855
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,039
it looks nearly identical to it and you

856
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,919
build that part and put that part into

857
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,480
your environment and you think about

858
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,760
um you know that often you know on

859
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,000
authentic part may work and may not be

860
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,039
malicious

861
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,960
but it may not work in all situations

862
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,440
where

863
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,600
you know you bought it because it runs

864
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,919
at 500 degrees and when you do reach

865
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,120
that temperature

866
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,840
uh it burns up and then it's not as good

867
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,480
as you'd

868
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,520
like it to be and so forth

869
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,159
all right so all of this is really great

870
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,399
but how does this really impact

871
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,840
uh you know information technology and

872
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,640
specifically

873
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,399
operational technology now

874
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,240
of course you know attackers are going

875
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
to attack your suppliers

876
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,200
now this does include things that you

877
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,919
buy

878
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,120
to integrate into your company as a part

879
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,600
of the things in which you

880
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,519
manufacture now one of the things that

881
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,600
folks might want to do

882
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,240
is create malware specifically targeted

883
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,279
to your

884
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,000
uh your product to attempt to maybe get

885
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,840
a copy of your source code

886
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,559
get a copy of your hardware device or

887
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,480
hardware designs however you laid out

888
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,519
your chips

889
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,200
uh you know maybe potentially create

890
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,279
counterfeits or or duplicate

891
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,320
pro you know do duplicate systems that

892
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,000
look identical to yours as i was

893
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,600
mentioning

894
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,440
basically leading to a loss of

895
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,360
intellectual property and if you do

896
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,519
any kind of google search on you know

897
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,720
folks targeting

898
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,279
uh you know the united states and trying

899
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,600
to you know potentially

900
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,320
get their intellectual property it it

901
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,360
it's it's a lot

902
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,240
so uh every year the number is bigger

903
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,480
bigger and bigger it seems like

904
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,840
all right now if you're manufacturing

905
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,080
and you're buying uh equipment and

906
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,919
you're integrating it as a part of how

907
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,600
you're developing your

908
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,559
uh systems what you want to make sure

909
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:04,960
that

910
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,120
the things that you're utilizing to test

911
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,240
invalidate

912
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,519
that what you're doing you know

913
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,080
developing is good to make sure that

914
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,360
that system

915
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,320
uh does not you know pass when it should

916
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,120
not pass

917
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,760
perhaps it's saying system's great i'm

918
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,519
gonna let it go on through

919
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,080
no big deal uh or there might be some

920
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,159
you know certain circumstances where it

921
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,559
yeah it doesn't it shouldn't pass right

922
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,840
but they're going to allow that

923
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,880
to pass now also it may have extra

924
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,440
firmware

925
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,559
other capability uh installed

926
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,639
that you might not necessarily want

927
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,320
and then of course you're passing things

928
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:44,799
right

929
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,360
so if you pass a system you say yes that

930
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,919
i ran it through all of my system tests

931
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,480
that system test um you know says it's

932
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,200
okay

933
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,880
i'm going to go ahead and let it um

934
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,240
let it you know send it to my customer

935
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,159
and my customer runs it and it fails

936
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,480
and he you know and he's doing his own

937
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,559
vendor tracking right he's looking at me

938
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,720
as being a supplier to him and he's

939
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,960
saying oh well you know that guy

940
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,640
didn't necessarily deliver a good

941
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,960
product well the next time he really

942
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,760
didn't do

943
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,440
a good product and then we lose that

944
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,799
customer trust and it's definitely

945
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,279
something that no one wants to have

946
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,200
um and and so forth um

947
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,480
anyway um yeah the false um

948
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,360
false pass rates can really um really

949
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,159
you know trick

950
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,960
trick you up and uh it another thing

951
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,240
that you might

952
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,279
potentially be concerned about is what

953
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,360
relationship you have to the folks that

954
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,080
maintain

955
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,440
the equipment that um allow

956
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,960
that pass your system so you might have

957
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,039
a situation where

958
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,440
a vendor shows up they show you know hey

959
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,159
i'm

960
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,640
you know the maintenance guy for product

961
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,919
x

962
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,039
and they are allowed to go in and find

963
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,240
the debug port

964
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,200
into plotting product x plug into that

965
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,000
upload some

966
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,119
extra fun uh firmware and

967
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,440
you know and let that uh potentially on

968
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,800
through and so

969
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,918
there's always um

970
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,159
a certain set of trust that one has with

971
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,119
um you know

972
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,040
things that you do in test equipment and

973
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,839
and so forth and so on

974
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,040
all right now organizat

975
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,520
all organizations really should have a

976
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,440
cyber supply chain risk management

977
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,399
capability

978
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,359
and you need to have a method to respond

979
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,960
to when things go wrong

980
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,440
and kind of go under the assumption that

981
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,560
what happens

982
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,800
when things do go wrong what is my

983
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,719
disaster recovery continuing uh

984
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,800
continuity of operations like how do i

985
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,239
keep uh

986
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,480
how do i keep going and what happens

987
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,480
when a vendor contacts

988
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,079
me and says um well i've been using

989
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,640
that thing that caused ripple 20. i

990
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,280
don't think you

991
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,920
knew about it but ripple 20 you know has

992
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,599
a lot of unknown vulnerabilities and

993
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,359
it's in my product now it's in your

994
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,720
product

995
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,880
you should be aware now when do they

996
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,000
tell you is it a

997
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,200
30-day 60-day 90-get day thing you know

998
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,599
how do you respond how do you you know

999
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,200
how do you tell your customers

1000
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,359
you know what is your vulnerability

1001
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,800
reporting you know

1002
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,440
uh whether you have a full you know

1003
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,760
common vulnerability uh and exposures

1004
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,240
you know process or or so forth how do

1005
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,119
you how do you do

1006
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,560
how do you respond to all of that

1007
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,520
now there are various different ways to

1008
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,040
specifically combat

1009
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,359
risk now sometimes folks will say well

1010
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,880
this all this is great but i really

1011
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
don't have the funds to do that

1012
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,240
so you might end up going with a third

1013
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:46,720
party

1014
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,320
now uh ul uh the other folks that

1015
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,920
com you'd commonly find on like light

1016
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,520
bulbs and stuff like that have been

1017
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,400
working on

1018
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,440
um a supplier trust level

1019
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,320
and level one uh nascent and as i

1020
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,079
mentioned you know things such as

1021
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,560
uh criticality kind of equate that to

1022
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,560
that so something's low criticality they

1023
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,440
might be

1024
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,800
nascent or um i'm sorry i'm i said that

1025
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,200
wrong

1026
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,560
um the criticality would be affected by

1027
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,960
their level of trust and so if you have

1028
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,680
a critical

1029
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,640
uh vulnerab a critical supplier and they

1030
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,400
are nascent that means that maybe

1031
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,480
perhaps they don't have

1032
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,280
very many uh cyber security practices

1033
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,119
and then you'd want to go in and work

1034
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:29,920
with them

1035
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,200
uh and help that supplier along and so

1036
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,520
to rate folks you could have a nascent a

1037
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,960
challenger a contender

1038
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,440
a strong performer or leader and we do

1039
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,000
hope that

1040
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,960
everyone on here does uh strive to be a

1041
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,760
leader

1042
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,000
uh and really has that highest trust you

1043
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,359
know they're putting out

1044
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,800
good code no known uh vulnerabilities

1045
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,040
are weaknesses in their products

1046
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,119
definitely no

1047
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,520
no design flaws or anything along that

1048
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,160
line

1049
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,000
and they're working with their suppliers

1050
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,280
to make sure that they

1051
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,359
that though their suppliers and their

1052
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,040
supplier suppliers which is that

1053
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,720
two-tier relationship

1054
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,400
that they are also becoming strong

1055
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,560
performers they're also becoming leaders

1056
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,720
in the way that they're delivering uh

1057
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,839
their capability

1058
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,440
uh capabilities today all right

1059
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,079
so what should one be doing after

1060
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,320
listening to this talk

1061
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,720
first definitely get educated on

1062
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,040
specific issues

1063
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,119
i.t is different than operational

1064
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,040
technology i tried to do a little bit

1065
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,359
more

1066
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,400
focus on operational technology

1067
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,599
today uh there's a lot i could say on it

1068
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,720
in addition

1069
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,480
uh but i think that subject has really

1070
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
been covered quite a bit

1071
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,640
and uh embedded systems and things that

1072
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,160
we use day in and day out

1073
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,880
they our daily lives do sometimes get

1074
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,359
missed

1075
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,800
and it's going to be different right so

1076
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,359
it you know if it crashes i reboot but

1077
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,079
ot

1078
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,640
might mean i have a problem or my

1079
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,400
production line stops or

1080
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,520
something is not going to be the way i

1081
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,400
want it to be

1082
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
it's not just a blue screen of death at

1083
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
that point

1084
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,520
now develop a specific set of questions

1085
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,040
for your suppliers

1086
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,160
uh some example ones you know do they

1087
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,119
have an

1088
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,760
application security program uh we tend

1089
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,599
to use the word software assurance so

1090
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,560
whether you use those two terms um

1091
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,760
basically

1092
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,040
what are they doing to deliver

1093
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,520
and implement secure coding and have

1094
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,079
that

1095
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,000
throughout their life cycle and deliver

1096
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,079
to you as you know someone that you're

1097
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:36,880
going to integrate

1098
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,800
into their uh product into your product

1099
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,640
now uh one of the things that's recently

1100
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,920
come out is a cyber security

1101
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,960
maturity model certification or cmmc

1102
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,320
as that starts to mature we'll see

1103
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,599
folks get assessed for the certain level

1104
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,839
of capability that they have

1105
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,640
very you know similar to the ul provided

1106
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,599
trust levels

1107
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,560
in some ways uh but basically the more

1108
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,400
capabilities that they get

1109
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,040
uh you know you'll be higher up the

1110
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,160
scale now uh

1111
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,960
kind of think of it very similar to

1112
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,079
other um

1113
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,119
cmm or cmmi uh done

1114
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,440
out of uh carnegie mellon or sci i'm

1115
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,800
sorry sci

1116
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,359
that um you know the same kind of rating

1117
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,240
the same kind of

1118
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,320
um structure and so so forth uh

1119
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,960
now do a perform a component uh risk

1120
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,599
assessment so look at each component

1121
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,000
um try to figure out you know one way to

1122
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,160
to categorize them whether it's ul or

1123
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,359
something like that

1124
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,880
figure out what kind of testing you

1125
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,240
might want to do you might want to say

1126
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,560
for this vendor i'm going to

1127
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,400
um i'm going to specifically

1128
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,960
do static analysis i'm going to check

1129
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,560
every line of code that they have

1130
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,320
i'm going to do pedigree um provenance

1131
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
uh for whatever it was make sure it's

1132
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,160
not just some open source code that they

1133
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,720
just

1134
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,960
copy and pasted uh you know you know

1135
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,240
straight into their product

1136
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,240
and and try to understand what what that

1137
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,319
is and and make sure that you

1138
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,040
implement that across your um your

1139
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,960
components

1140
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,280
uh now you also may want to use a

1141
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,440
third-party vendor and i just kind of

1142
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,599
just a quick list i think at the time i

1143
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,280
just kind of googled third party

1144
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,560
uh vendor you know whatever you feel uh

1145
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,040
might be a good choice but you know

1146
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,079
these companies

1147
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,480
they they go out and they look at

1148
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
products they look at

1149
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,160
um maybe known uh issues with various

1150
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,920
different vendors and they'll rate them

1151
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,319
uh

1152
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,400
based on their perception of that

1153
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,000
particular vendor so if you don't have a

1154
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,880
method

1155
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,040
or a way to um you know understand

1156
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,640
what's being done then perhaps they

1157
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,280
might

1158
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,800
provide some guidance for you and then

1159
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,240
of course still probably number one

1160
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,839
partner with your suppliers

1161
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,040
and make sure that your suppliers

1162
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,240
aren't just feeling like okay i i i give

1163
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,079
my product to this other person

1164
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,000
and that other person just takes it and

1165
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,920
then scans my code and tells me my code

1166
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,960
is bad

1167
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,720
you know that you're working with them

1168
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,960
and providing feedback and say you know

1169
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,040
you guys have a lot of buffer overflows

1170
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,200
maybe we could provide for you some

1171
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,800
secure coding training that we might

1172
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,200
have

1173
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,000
so here's some example code here's ways

1174
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,880
to fix that

1175
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,359
let's validate our input you know all of

1176
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,880
those wonderful things

1177
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,560
um partnering with their suppliers can

1178
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,800
go a long way to make sure that they

1179
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,720
uh you know build you know build that

1180
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,079
security into their products

1181
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,400
build it into your products uh and so

1182
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,079
forth and then

1183
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,440
eventually of course everyone has to

1184
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,200
have a plan so

1185
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,560
uh as you if you develop your product

1186
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,839
have a cyber scrim plan all the way from

1187
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,800
you know you know make buy decisions all

1188
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,400
the way to the very end

1189
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,240
uh how are you going to handle it you

1190
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,680
know in some cases

1191
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,760
some folks will work with vendors and

1192
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,880
they will um

1193
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,319
have third parties that host um

1194
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,400
the source code just in case third party

1195
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,520
goes out of business

1196
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,200
and so they will they will do that um

1197
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,079
and and have you know have that

1198
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,240
capability so if the third party does go

1199
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,480
out of business then you'd want to go in

1200
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,520
and you know have rights to maybe get

1201
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,760
access to that in case you need to

1202
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,160
uh update it over time and so whatever

1203
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,000
whatever is important to you you put

1204
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,280
that in your supply chain

1205
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,040
a risk management plan and then work

1206
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,880
with your vendors uh and so forth

1207
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,800
now here's a set of references uh some

1208
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,960
of the ones we called out today

1209
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,480
um i think that is about it

1210
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,760
um and so i think we're ready for

1211
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,839
question and answers

1212
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,920
which i haven't seen any posted on the q

1213
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,079
a or the chat but if you

1214
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,680
have a question you can go ahead and

1215
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,520
enter it that would be

1216
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,680
uh that would be totally okay either one

1217
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:13,760
i've got them both

1218
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,200
like i said while you guys are uh

1219
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,440
thinking of questions i will note that

1220
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,040
one of the questions we had beforehand

1221
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,880
we had a question about threat modeling

1222
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,359
and

1223
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,920
maybe how threat modeling applies and i

1224
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,400
think

1225
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,359
mining is extraordinarily important it

1226
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,880
does help you determine

1227
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,200
what what is you know what's critical to

1228
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,480
you and

1229
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,119
where an attacker might go at you and

1230
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:35,839
when i kind of

1231
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,280
generically saying you know if someone's

1232
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,480
going to attack you go look at your

1233
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,200
suppliers

1234
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,880
but they might come at you with various

1235
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,200
different other ways too and so

1236
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,560
um even threat modeling your suppliers

1237
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,839
would be a really cool thing uh to do

1238
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,079
and and determine how might your

1239
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,000
suppliers supply your suppliers

1240
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,280
um you know wiggle your way into your um

1241
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,880
product okay so we have a question uh

1242
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,960
can you elaborate on a specific case of

1243
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,680
discovering

1244
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,400
a threat and how it was handled um

1245
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,640
so i'm not allowed to talk specifically

1246
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,839
on

1247
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,359
things that happened in particular with

1248
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,280
my own company but i can tell you

1249
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,319
that and i i will um

1250
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,760
generically talk about um

1251
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,079
the the issue with respect to um

1252
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,640
to solar winds uh so if those of you

1253
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,560
aren't familiar with that particular

1254
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,079
tool it it has been used in a lot of

1255
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,359
network uh security environments and

1256
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,520
and some people have very much called

1257
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,040
this a supply chain

1258
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,880
attack now one of the things that you'll

1259
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,599
want to do as someone who writes code

1260
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,119
is um that supply chain uh

1261
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,520
will uh want you'll have to have a way

1262
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,319
to update

1263
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,599
the code and so what they did is they

1264
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,680
um you know they updated their code just

1265
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,200
like normal and

1266
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,720
somehow someone got access to uh

1267
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,720
you know their repository their code

1268
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,200
signing cert and so forth

1269
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,640
and it it was very it was very difficult

1270
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,880
in a tough situation for them

1271
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,440
uh to deal with and they you know a lot

1272
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,560
of folks

1273
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,480
wouldn't have necessarily found that

1274
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,599
particular

1275
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,280
exploit but there was a lot of you know

1276
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,200
work being done to kind of communicate

1277
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,119
you know what is it what's going on

1278
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,960
on with that and i think the whole

1279
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,280
community uh came together

1280
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,880
and um really handled it in a very good

1281
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,000
way working together

1282
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,680
exchanging you know various different

1283
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,440
ways to um

1284
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,839
you know do indicators of compromise

1285
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:48,560
find

1286
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,800
uh various different issues maybe maybe

1287
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,200
provide different ideas on how

1288
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,000
um one might go about you know scanning

1289
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,319
for

1290
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,480
such a type of thing right so a lot of

1291
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,720
times if you don't have um

1292
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,400
you know uh a static binary analysis

1293
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,599
where you're looking at what does the

1294
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,000
binary do if the binary is opening up a

1295
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,480
socket when it's not supposed to a lot

1296
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,359
of people don't

1297
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,680
do that so there's a lot of tools that

1298
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,480
are available

1299
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,960
uh whether you're using ida pro or

1300
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,599
guidra

1301
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,160
or some of the other uh kind of reverse

1302
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,160
engineering tools that are out there

1303
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,920
uh there's a lot of things that that can

1304
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,760
be done now

1305
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,760
with respect to handling handling

1306
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,800
threats

1307
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,560
i mentioned it's very good to have a

1308
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,480
certain time frame so whether it's

1309
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,359
30 days 60 days 90 days or even in some

1310
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:35,839
cases

1311
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:39,040
24 hours right so if i get a problem

1312
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,720
24 hours we're telling everyone or

1313
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,240
something like that that might be the

1314
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,119
requirement

1315
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,520
so um having those defined i think is

1316
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,079
very

1317
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,160
very important with respect to discovery

1318
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,480
and letting that out

1319
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,200
um so now i do have a question uh in uh

1320
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,720
so i'm gonna answer it live i guess i

1321
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,760
push that button but

1322
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,839
i'll read it first and it says uh one

1323
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,079
may consider using a software escrow

1324
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,920
service when bringing in third-party

1325
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,760
software components uh into their

1326
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,480
product

1327
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,880
yes that's exactly uh some of the things

1328
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,280
i was mentioning about having that third

1329
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,079
party

1330
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,400
um actually a lot of people forget about

1331
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,920
um escrow services

1332
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,839
they they do exist and as uh if you have

1333
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,359
uh if you're buying something from a

1334
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,839
company maybe they might not necessarily

1335
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,720
they might not necessarily know whether

1336
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,000
or not that company is going to be in

1337
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,559
business

1338
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,760
in 5 10 15 years and considering that

1339
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,640
software

1340
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,240
escrow might be a good idea depending on

1341
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,079
you know what you know what might happen

1342
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,520
and so that might be something

1343
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,800
it's kind of between you and your

1344
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,800
supplier uh and

1345
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,119
and so forth um i had a couple comment

1346
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,079
on chat so i'm gonna hit

1347
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,119
answer live on that one and

1348
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,880
let me scroll back up i had a couple

1349
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,720
come in so let me try to take them in

1350
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,520
order

1351
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,839
um how would you consult someone about

1352
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,359
social engineering attacks

1353
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,920
a lot of companies don't realize uh

1354
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,119
someone

1355
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,319
can uh basically

1356
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,559
kind of call them and pretend to be

1357
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:09,359
someone

1358
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:12,559
um if if you ever get a chance i

1359
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,839
strongly recommend

1360
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:17,040
um you attend the uh so if you go to

1361
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,640
like a

1362
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,280
a conference like defcon uh try to get

1363
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:21,760
into

1364
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,079
the social engineering village and uh

1365
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,760
about a year ago there actually was a

1366
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,760
social engineering um

1367
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,480
conference uh in particular and uh

1368
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,800
there's a lot of great examples about

1369
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,359
um you know you know folks creating

1370
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,800
websites out there

1371
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,599
um having exact uh you know have you

1372
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,280
know pictures you know looks just like a

1373
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,359
company website it might say you know

1374
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,400
that company's name

1375
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,160
dot you know question questions.com

1376
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,520
and they'll say hey you know um

1377
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,280
you know we're having trouble uh

1378
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,720
validating maybe

1379
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,240
we'll just throw suppliers out there

1380
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,640
right so you know

1381
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,960
can you enter your key suppliers in here

1382
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,000
so we can double check

1383
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,800
them and make sure that they're not on

1384
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,359
any

1385
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,319
list of you know delivering bad bad

1386
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:08,720
stuff

1387
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,880
and so you get tricked very easily like

1388
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,160
oh okay i will

1389
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,839
all they want to know is just who my who

1390
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,680
my key suppliers are so now

1391
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,680
they know who your key suppliers are so

1392
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,280
if they can go you know take them out

1393
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,839
it's vote it's so easy to trick people

1394
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,920
uh i have seen um and i'm not a social

1395
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,520
engineer my joke about social

1396
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,119
engineering is basically

1397
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,960
so i lock down my system and someone

1398
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,720
goes what's your password

1399
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,240
and you're like solarwinds1234 um

1400
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,319
you know if you if if it's that easy

1401
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,400
then you know someone just tricks you

1402
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:40,720
and

1403
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,319
and you just give up the password and

1404
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,160
i've seen so many even

1405
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,880
smart intelligent people be tricked from

1406
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,240
social engineering

1407
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,280
um it i would say um

1408
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,720
education is great um knowing what to do

1409
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,000
when you do get that fish or spearfished

1410
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,920
is is is is very very good um

1411
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,079
i know i know kevin mitnick puts out a

1412
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,000
lot of courses along that area and

1413
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,040
there's a lot of

1414
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,720
some companies that he work with he

1415
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,640
works with that do put out training in

1416
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,520
that area

1417
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,000
and there are third parties that do

1418
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,800
targeted

1419
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,520
um social engineering to kind of see how

1420
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,079
this organization doing with respect to

1421
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,599
identifying social engineering tricks

1422
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,200
all right i'll move on to the next one

1423
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,480
it says what do you think about

1424
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,640
bloomberg doubling down on the supplier

1425
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,200
chain

1426
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,839
you mentioned despite uh producing any

1427
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,839
public evidence of their claim

1428
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,800
um yeah i was following that very

1429
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,160
intently

1430
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,839
because um i didn't i

1431
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,079
personally i don't know whether or not

1432
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,839
there was something there

1433
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,160
but when i think about how small the

1434
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,040
chips are getting

1435
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,960
and they're getting smaller and smaller

1436
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,640
to a point that maybe you can't find

1437
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,520
things

1438
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,000
maybe it was or wasn't there i don't i

1439
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,520
don't really know but it does give me

1440
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,240
pause

1441
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,319
for thought right you look at a system

1442
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,079
board if i hold up a system board can

1443
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,839
you tell me what's on that board

1444
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,480
uh there's a lot of a lot of stuff there

1445
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,280
and

1446
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,240
i can't tell you that all the the

1447
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,480
transistors are exactly the way that i

1448
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,680
originally designed

1449
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,000
if if i don't have a good method to you

1450
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,040
know validate that

1451
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,480
so um all i can say is they you know

1452
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,119
they did double down as drew was

1453
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,160
mentioning and

1454
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,040
they were very adamant that and i don't

1455
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,319
think even today have they

1456
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,760
retracted anything so um

1457
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,800
i can't i'm not bloomberg but uh they

1458
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,800
seem to be very adamant that that was

1459
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,559
that was definitely the case

1460
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,640
all right um i have one to send to me

1461
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,920
directly so let me see if that's

1462
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,760
actually a question or

1463
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,440
um and so forth um

1464
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,520
oh so the question is really around uh

1465
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,960
small manufacturers

1466
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,319
um and not having the security staff

1467
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:59,440
uh you know a lot a lot of folks there

1468
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,240
there is

1469
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,680
so you guys are if you guys are taking

1470
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,359
this course i can tell you

1471
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,000
um i went to pre university i had a lot

1472
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,040
of job offers

1473
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,599
um i luckily had a nice conversation

1474
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,640
with uh dr

1475
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,480
spafford and i said hey i'm gonna have i

1476
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,559
have all these which one should i take

1477
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:15,599
and he was like

1478
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,359
you take that one and that one was a

1479
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,000
network security job

1480
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,200
there are there's just a huge shortage

1481
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,040
out there of of of really good

1482
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,720
people i think some people say well

1483
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,880
there's millions of unfilled jobs well

1484
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,720
yeah there's a lot of jobs out there but

1485
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,240
really good people

1486
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,000
and you know you guys are going to

1487
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,480
purdue i have high faith in you guys

1488
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,079
all and um i think that you know you

1489
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:42,880
guys can fill

1490
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,680
a lot of those roles and whether you're

1491
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,160
small

1492
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,800
or maybe even moderate sized you might

1493
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,400
not always have

1494
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,000
um you know all the people that have

1495
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,760
the kind of training that you guys have

1496
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,000
had or something along the lines so

1497
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,839
um they're it it it depends it really

1498
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:02,880
depends on

1499
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,480
the quality like i definitely have

1500
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,640
talked to folks i feel like i'm like a

1501
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,040
few few people and i'm like wow that

1502
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:09,760
guy's like

1503
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,800
he's going somewhere he's very smart um

1504
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,119
and so it it let's say that to the

1505
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,800
answer to the question i would say

1506
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,160
it depends right it really depends on

1507
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,160
the person working the job and i can

1508
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,559
tell you honestly that cyber security is

1509
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:25,760
just plain awesome

1510
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,559
and i strongly recommend it keep going

1511
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:29,680
in cyber security

1512
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,800
and um you know especially

1513
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,559
if you ever get into understanding like

1514
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,720
how x-plays work and you make an exploit

1515
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,920
work and you understand

1516
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,520
everything about it it's it's

1517
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,800
interesting it's kind of like when you

1518
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,960
lock pick and you finally pick that lock

1519
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,079
it's really kind of cool so i recommend

1520
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,160
it

1521
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,640
um so you might want to mention

1522
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,079
diversity of roles

1523
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,800
in our field um socks cert audit

1524
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,359
compliance uh just by two cents

1525
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,800
um i'm assuming you mean um doing

1526
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,200
uh both uh security operations and

1527
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,800
incident response

1528
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,119
uh and then kind of like transitioning

1529
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,160
into uh

1530
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,280
audit and compliance yes um

1531
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,359
and this isn't uh you know like uh

1532
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,880
necessarily like um

1533
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,000
yeah yeah okay yeah to paul's um

1534
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,280
statement uh they're in cyber security

1535
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,000
there is everything and if someone asks

1536
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,920
me like what area of cyber security do

1537
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,240
you

1538
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,119
special in and i go cissp and they're

1539
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,599
like

1540
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,280
really i'm like yeah i'll do everything

1541
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,680
and there is a wide range of jobs

1542
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,040
whether you're doing

1543
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,359
compliance which compliance can just be

1544
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,559
like a check in the box

1545
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,520
to implementing uh cyber security to

1546
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,079
reverse

1547
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,200
engineering to i'm a developer and i

1548
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,480
write secure code

1549
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,720
i'm a secure architect i'm a cloud

1550
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,000
security person

1551
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,119
i am um you know all of those

1552
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,359
as someone who's done a lot of different

1553
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:58,640
roles

1554
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,319
changing what you're doing every so

1555
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:01,760
often is really

1556
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,040
kind of good uh you will find um

1557
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,920
different points of view and it will

1558
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,680
definitely make you a better

1559
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,240
cyber security person i know if i kind

1560
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:12,960
of come in

1561
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,880
and be like okay i'm cyber secure you

1562
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,880
know i'm the cyber security person and

1563
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,599
i'm here to

1564
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,440
make everything better oh by the way

1565
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,280
your software is

1566
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,319
not so secure uh you know we've done

1567
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,160
these static analysis tools

1568
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,000
on it and it says this and i've gone

1569
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,280
through it and i've kind of like

1570
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,760
validated those things

1571
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,799
you know you know just saying what a

1572
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:35,599
tool says

1573
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,079
isn't really really that great but

1574
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:38,960
understanding

1575
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,240
exactly um why it works the way it is

1576
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,760
especially coming from like a

1577
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,440
programming background and understanding

1578
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,319
how software

1579
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,799
you know is put together is is very

1580
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:51,680
important so having a wide range of jobs

1581
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,040
um i mean i've done network security

1582
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,839
uh networks so network security led into

1583
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,359
network intrusion detection

1584
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:02,000
which led into vulnerability

1585
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:02,960
identification

1586
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,680
which included vulnerability reverse

1587
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,640
engineering

1588
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,319
to exploitation to you know how was that

1589
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:11,280
done in other

1590
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,079
you know other industries so definitely

1591
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,119
wide variety

1592
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,599
of jobs very very cool to look at

1593
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,799
okay i think that's it that last one was

1594
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,319
had nothing to do with with really

1595
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:30,000
supply chain but

1596
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,839
you so much for joining the series

1597
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,280
seminar and um

1598
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,119
we'll make videos available in our

1599
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,400
youtube channel
