1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,320
let me start by saying hello i'm gene

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,439
spafford

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,480
i'm the founder and executive director

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,160
emeritus

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,320
which means former

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,080
uh executive director of sirius

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,600
and sirius is

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,400
a large organization here on campus

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,439
it is a campus-wide institute devoted to

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,680
a number of issues primarily cyber

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,720
security privacy cyber physical systems

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,199
explainable ai

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,280
things that affect

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,440
people if systems don't work as they're

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,000
supposed to

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,120
what we're going to try and do here

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,399
is

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,000
switch this presentation over

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,960
to joel rasmus who is

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,559
our managing director and he is going to

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,280
present this remotely

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,160
um and

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,600
[Music]

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,760
joel i don't have a second screen so

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,680
you'll have to send me messages when you

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,479
want me to advance

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,880
will do

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,360
good afternoon everybody and uh thank

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,960
you for showing up we have a nice

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,159
turnout

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,720
um and as professor spafford had

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,680
mentioned

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,400
that uh this is being recorded we will

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,680
post it on our uh our website

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,439
so please help spread the word to the

36
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,520
other students uh that might be in your

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,720
classes your friends your labs what it

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,680
may be

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,280
who have a interest in cyber security

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
and as spaff has mentioned our

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,439
definition of cyber security is very

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,399
very broad so if we go to the next slide

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,720
please

44
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,880
oops there we go

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,000
there we go

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,479
so this is kind of who in a nutshell

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,320
this is the elevator pitch and what is

48
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,240
serious or who is serious so

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,119
we're the largest oldest and top-ranked

50
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,600
interdisciplinary education and research

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,360
institute for cyber

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,239
and cyber physical systems and our

53
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,160
faculty and students conduct

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,920
impactful research in the areas of

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,280
security

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,879
privacy resiliency autonomy

57
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,400
trusted electronics and explainable ai

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,760
so while the world is in still in need

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,120
of top

60
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,680
it security talent

61
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,360
there's more

62
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,760
that can be done to provide a more cyber

63
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,120
secure world

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
so one of the serious goals is to bring

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,040
together these world-class faculty

66
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,840
students and industry partners

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,319
who are all working at least try to move

68
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,879
this into a more secure world so next

69
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,200
slide

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,720
so there's often a question is that well

71
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,560
i'm in computer science or i'm in the

72
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,879
polytechnic i'm in the computer science

73
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,879
undergraduate major i'm in

74
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,200
ece but i'm working on trusted

75
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,959
electronics there's

76
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,440
there is no one discipline that is

77
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,599
considered cyber security

78
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,120
and so as such

79
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,920
we have affiliated with us 135

80
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,879
purdue faculty who come from 20

81
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,040
different academic departments

82
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,440
across eight different colleges

83
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,720
so i've mentioned some of the

84
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,640
departments and colleges right now that

85
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,760
make sense computer science ece and

86
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,760
other engineering disciplines and

87
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,760
several disciplines within the college

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,319
of science primarily being i'm sorry in

89
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,159
the polytechnic primarily being the

90
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,959
computer science and cit

91
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,040
but there's also those that are spread

92
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,640
out across the rest of the disciplines

93
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,239
and krannert a number of students and

94
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,280
faculty who are working on the economics

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,280
of cyber security who are training

96
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,239
people to be csos and cios who are

97
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,920
working on

98
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,560
the idea of how you can work against

99
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,280
fraud in social media

100
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,760
social media is also an area of interest

101
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,319
by people in computer in

102
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,720
communications and liberal arts a number

103
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,319
of people in liberal arts who are

104
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,400
affiliated with this there are people

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,959
across campus and as i just mentioned 20

106
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,480
different departments

107
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,799
now that's just this faculty if we take

108
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,880
a look at the students there are

109
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,160
thousands of students at purdue who are

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
studying in a discipline

111
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,240
that's related to cyber or cyber

112
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,160
physical security

113
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,400
so on the right hand of this slide you

114
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,600
will see the different uh home

115
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,199
colleges at purdue the one that is not

116
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,000
there is the honors college but all but

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,759
two of these colleges do we have faculty

118
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,520
who are affiliated

119
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,840
those two without serious affiliated

120
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,160
faculty are pharmacy and veterinary

121
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,720
medicine interestingly enough our

122
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,800
faculty are conducting research in these

123
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,280
areas it just happens to be

124
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,440
faculty in different disciplines who are

125
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,160
working on problems for pharmacy and who

126
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,919
are working on problems for veterinary

127
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,080
medicine we don't have any pharma

128
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,199
pharmacy

129
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,639
professors or

130
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,880
veterinary professors who are working in

131
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,120
cyber yet

132
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,639
i suspect we'll take over the world

133
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,880
sometime and and across absolutely every

134
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,240
department there will be or at least

135
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,000
every college there will be somebody

136
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,400
involved in this and next slide please

137
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,000
so

138
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,039
in the definition of who is serious i

139
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,759
mentioned three constituencies

140
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,320
i said world-class faculty students and

141
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
industry partners

142
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,360
so

143
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,120
while i'm happy to talk at any time

144
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,039
about our faculty and our industry

145
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,960
partners uh tonight's focus obviously is

146
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,759
on our student constituency

147
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,560
you in the audience both here in lawson

148
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,000
as well as online and then the

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,759
well over a thousand who we have not

150
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,039
quite reached yet and you're going to

151
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,880
help us connect to next slide

152
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,479
so this entire presentation is really

153
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,120
why would you want to be a

154
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,440
a serious affiliated student

155
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,520
so students why register was serious and

156
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,919
that's what we're all driving here in

157
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,199
the chat box i've put four different uh

158
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,600
links to things on our on the serious

159
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,479
web pages and the first one is also here

160
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,880
on this slide and i think nearly every

161
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,120
other slide that i'll be showing

162
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,440
and actually this is an incorrect one so

163
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
it should be new student

164
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,560
so students receive a number of benefits

165
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,520
so the student from any department that

166
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,080
has an interest in cyber cyber security

167
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,720
can self register self-affiliate with

168
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,919
sirius and what that primarily does is

169
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,160
it puts you on our it puts you on our

170
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,479
rolls but puts you on our email list so

171
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,240
that when we have announcements or

172
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,960
things to share or events to host your

173
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,800
recognize and get special treatment

174
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
because of that

175
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,240
and these next few slides are all going

176
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
to talk about that i'm not going to just

177
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
read the slides because you can all read

178
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,639
these slides but i will touch base on

179
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,720
some of the points so throughout the

180
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,919
year we host and others on campus will

181
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,960
host

182
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,360
special events whether that's lecturers

183
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,479
challenges competitions or workshops so

184
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,280
we use our serious student list to be

185
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,440
able to promote those opportunities

186
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,800
because if you're interested in cyber

187
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,319
security there's a darn good chance that

188
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,520
you're going to be interested in some of

189
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,039
these special events

190
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,639
that are on campus

191
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,199
we also have we also host purdue

192
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,599
signature cyber security event

193
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,840
each year in the spring well

194
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,520
lucky you guys that the event that it

195
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,360
was supposed to take been take place in

196
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,599
the spring because of the pandemic has

197
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,280
been postponed so

198
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,919
the first time ever we'll have this

199
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,400
serious the annual syria security

200
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,120
symposium held twice within a year and

201
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,879
the first one is coming up next month

202
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,680
october 19 and 20 and registration is

203
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,919
already open to that and because you are

204
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,479
going to be a serious affiliated student

205
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,840
it is free for you to be able to attend

206
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,000
and because it's virtual you won't have

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,919
to miss any classes you can pop in and

208
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,160
out and be able to participate in any of

209
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
the events that you have an interest in

210
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,520
we're going to return to this late in

211
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,360
the presentation

212
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,280
and then we were we are planning to

213
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,080
return to our normal schedule of hosting

214
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,639
the annual symposium in the spring and

215
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,800
that will be at the end of end of march

216
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,680
next

217
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,000
slide please

218
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,479
so career assistance

219
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,760
purdue and sirius has the reputation of

220
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,839
churning out unbelievably great

221
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,479
well-trained students and so many

222
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,719
organizations are reaching out to us

223
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,039
both commercial and government saying

224
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,600
what can we do to hire your brilliant

225
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,920
students and so one of the things we do

226
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
is we try to connect our brilliant

227
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,320
students with organize with top

228
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,560
organizations who are looking for talent

229
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,480
again across the very very broadly

230
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,600
defined area of what is cyber security

231
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,480
so

232
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,560
there will be organizations that will

233
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,480
want to come to campus

234
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,800
we will have some coming up very soon

235
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,920
for mitre corporation which is a u.s

236
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,399
federally supported research laboratory

237
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,000
several of the department of energy

238
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
research laboratories and then

239
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,720
commercial companies as well that will

240
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
come

241
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,560
they'll show up their laptop

242
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,440
oftentimes they will uh order pizza

243
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,640
and then they'll run through and say let

244
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,920
me tell you about my company it gives

245
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
you an opportunity that you can wear

246
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,760
your jeans you can wear your shorts you

247
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
can wear whatever your t-shirts you can

248
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,920
take in the information and then decide

249
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,600
whether this is an organization that

250
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,279
you'd like to learn more about that you

251
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,519
potentially like to intern in the summer

252
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,600
that you potentially like to work at so

253
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,519
it's a low pressure opportunity to be

254
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,120
able to learn everything learn some

255
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,760
things about the organization

256
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,399
we also have career job announcements so

257
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,560
our partners will send us hey joel we're

258
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,959
looking for entry level or mid-level or

259
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,320
we're looking for somebody with very

260
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
specialized expertise

261
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,880
can you share this with your students

262
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,959
sometimes that share this with your

263
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,200
students is can you blast this out and

264
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,120
let as many students at purdue know

265
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,320
about this

266
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,480
sometimes it comes in and say this is a

267
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,560
very computer science oriented can you

268
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,880
just share with cs students who are in

269
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,279
the security track or we're looking for

270
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,360
front lines applied people to be systems

271
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,680
administrators systems architects we

272
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,040
probably will find those in the

273
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,959
polytechnic can you share there and

274
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,040
again the examples can go on throughout

275
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,959
it there's also the opportunity that

276
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,040
they'll come in and they'll say

277
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,680
joel this is requiring somebody with a

278
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,240
phd so we try not to send those to the

279
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,760
undergraduates if you're a freshman

280
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,399
you're probably not quite ready to talk

281
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,519
about phd candidate jobs so we will

282
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,839
parse that down and send it out now one

283
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,839
very important notice that because we do

284
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,160
have several u.s government

285
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,920
uh entities that are part of our

286
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,560
organization and because many of them do

287
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,200
work obviously for the us government or

288
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,920
the military that they are required

289
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,120
to hire

290
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,680
uh people who are clearable meaning that

291
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,600
they are able to have a u.s security

292
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,640
clearance

293
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,680
and it is it at this point it is

294
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,959
extremely rare for a non-us citizen to

295
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,920
be able to get a security clearance so i

296
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,519
cannot guarantee

297
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,560
to all of our international students our

298
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,040
non-us citizen students that you will

299
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,600
not ever see a job that will come out

300
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
that will require you to be a citizen

301
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,800
but we do try to parse those back

302
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,720
so if you do see when that comes through

303
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,160
and often times they'll come through and

304
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,079
here here are opportunities at four

305
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,240
different companies as we are now

306
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,720
entering into september the hard

307
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,880
recruitment time for these organizations

308
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,480
there's an opportunity that you'll see

309
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,240
of those and and you look at the job

310
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,320
description and realize that there is

311
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,639
that requirement that precludes you from

312
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,079
from um

313
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,360
from applying

314
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,120
apologies in advance if you see those

315
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,440
that is just the nature of the world

316
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,680
and we know the same thing in students

317
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
who are in your home countries and other

318
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,360
countries that there are those same

319
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,120
opera there are those same restrictions

320
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,000
the globe over we just understand it

321
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,480
but as you all know there's more than a

322
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,800
million job opportunities right now of

323
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,959
open wrecks first for

324
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,200
uh for cyber security people so

325
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,279
if it's not a job that you can't afford

326
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,399
that you're not able to apply for

327
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,160
because you're not a u.s citizen i'm

328
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,120
sorry then that's we still have 999

329
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,639
999

330
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,639
other jobs that we'll be able to help

331
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,680
you potentially look for out there

332
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,560
so

333
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,040
we also host a

334
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,440
cyber security job fair every year this

335
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,880
year will be virtual it'll be on

336
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,720
september 20th there will be a slide

337
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,800
devoted to that specifically and it is

338
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,480
one of the slides that's later one of

339
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,240
the the links that's in the chat right

340
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,000
now

341
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,959
sirius is also the holder of the center

342
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,880
for academic excellence and cyber

343
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,639
security that's a certification or a

344
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,560
designation that is given out by the u.s

345
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,639
department of homeland security and the

346
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,320
national security agency so dhs and nsa

347
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,800
so we're actually one of the i'm going

348
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,959
to use the air quotes original seven

349
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,480
when they introduced this program we

350
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,320
were one of the seven universe one of

351
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,760
the original seven universities that

352
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,639
said

353
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,639
this organization this college is doing

354
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,000
a great job in training uh students to

355
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,800
go work in cyber security

356
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,079
so as by virtue of being part of the cae

357
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,560
the center for academic excellence

358
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,079
there are several

359
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,399
u.s government hosted

360
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,440
job fairs and they may be located around

361
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,000
the country and they're also virtual so

362
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,279
there will be one that i'll be sending

363
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,800
out in the next day or two to promoting

364
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
one of those virtual career fairs that's

365
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,519
not hosted at purdue but is open to all

366
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,320
purdue students because you are part of

367
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,560
a center for academic excellence

368
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,439
next slide please

369
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,480
oh by the way is monica in the audience

370
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,720
if so raise your hand

371
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,880
i caught this on twitter i knew that you

372
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,040
were you i knew that you'd kill it

373
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,639
in your internship but it was great to

374
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,760
see nasa tweet out uh how great of an

375
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,920
internship that you had this summer

376
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,639
next slide please

377
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,160
so

378
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,279
um

379
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,800
i do know that these both of these

380
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,160
students i saw your name in there that

381
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,760
you're either in the room or online

382
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,959
there so

383
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,959
also students are usually looking for

384
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,639
funding at the graduate level that means

385
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,240
you're looking for somebody to either

386
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,000
underwrite your full education and or

387
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,680
your research and at the undergrad level

388
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,959
you're looking for potentially

389
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,959
opportunities to have some of or all of

390
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,639
your education paid for

391
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,880
these opportunities don't come up every

392
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,839
day but we do have opportunities to

393
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,480
promote scholarships for cyber security

394
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,240
focused students those are primarily

395
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,079
undergraduate focused and then

396
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,079
fellowship opportunities which are

397
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,480
primarily graduate

398
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,920
student focused

399
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,519
and i will be sending out a few of those

400
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,600
in the next couple of days as well

401
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,959
and then opportunities that are right

402
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,959
here on campus are the next three so

403
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,440
whether they're teaching assistantships

404
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,920
most you already recognize those as a ta

405
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,800
or a grad assistantship a ga those

406
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,720
announcements will come out to help one

407
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,040
of our fac one of our affiliated faculty

408
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,720
with their classes and their labs

409
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,600
whatever

410
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,000
there are also serious research

411
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,320
assistantships and we'll be announcing

412
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,560
some of those soon

413
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,240
and that will ask you that if you are

414
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,079
funded graduate students if you are

415
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,079
actually undergraduates as well that if

416
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,399
you were to be chosen what research

417
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,839
would you want to conduct this semester

418
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,079
and that would be next semester uh and

419
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,800
then uh sirius will pick up your your

420
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,000
tuition

421
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,560
so uh and fees so it's absolutely pretty

422
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,480
cool so look for those opportunities

423
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,959
then i put down there that these cover

424
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,320
not only tuition and fees but if you're

425
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,920
a graduate student it actually provides

426
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,480
a stipend or monthly salary

427
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,839
next next slide please

428
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,079
so i mentioned uh some student clubs

429
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,079
that are out there so there are a number

430
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,519
of clubs so the next couple of slides

431
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,040
will do there so this

432
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,360
slide is actually a brag on two of our

433
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,240
team

434
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,399
two of our student clubs

435
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,079
that have done very very well in the

436
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,839
last 12 months

437
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,920
and are preparing for competitions right

438
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,800
now

439
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,440
so there are a number of these clubs

440
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,320
competition teams honor societies that

441
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,720
are here at purdue and at our sister

442
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,360
organizations at iupui

443
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,639
and iupuis the cyber jags

444
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,040
function as an extension of purdue cyber

445
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,480
security

446
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240
so anytime one of our

447
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,920
clubs teams honor societies has an event

448
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,399
we'll also promote that through through

449
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,079
the website next slide

450
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,240
and here are the list of those

451
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,480
organizations and

452
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,360
you know any student group any student

453
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,160
group can get together and form a new

454
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,560
club or a student organization so if

455
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,600
you're so if you are aware of other uh

456
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,920
new uh cyber security oriented uh clubs

457
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,799
at purdue or at iupui or at any of the

458
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,799
regional purdue campuses please let me

459
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,559
know we'll reach out to them offer them

460
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,439
a seat on our cyber security student

461
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,240
advisory board i do know that there is a

462
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,599
there is a organization that is uh that

463
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,039
hosts an annual hackathon uh and i have

464
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,119
struggled to make contact with that

465
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,199
organization so if you're affiliated

466
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,440
with that group please drop me an email

467
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,880
i would love to know more about your

468
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,320
organization and promote your club's

469
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,120
opportunities

470
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,039
so each of these organizations that are

471
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,679
on here do have a website link off of

472
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,880
the sirius website that you can contact

473
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,760
those organizations direct they all are

474
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,320
having their call outs at this time and

475
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,840
at the end of our talk if any of the

476
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,160
leadership of any of these clubs uh

477
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,919
would like to have a few minutes to

478
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,000
speak please raise your hand at the end

479
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,080
and we're happy to turn over and and

480
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,400
have you announce your call-out dates or

481
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,360
give us a brief elevator pitch about uh

482
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,360
what makes what's cool about your club

483
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,400
and why you're different than other

484
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,360
clubs uh it's very very pleasing to me

485
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,080
personally to have a student advisory

486
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,200
board that has each club uh represented

487
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,240
on it

488
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,240
because we've seen great

489
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,720
cooperation between all the clubs so

490
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,640
these count these clubs do not compete

491
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,559
against each other they're all part of

492
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,039
the very diverse landscape and ecosystem

493
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,160
at purdue of what is cyber security so

494
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,000
we've even have opportunities that we've

495
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,320
had competitions said aha this isn't

496
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,720
necessarily a perfect fit for any one of

497
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,200
our clubs but we've had members of the

498
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,440
forensics club members of wheasus

499
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,320
members of the ccdc club and boilers

500
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,000
which is the capture of the flag club

501
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,160
put together odd ad ad hoc uh groups and

502
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,960
go and compete together so it's a lot of

503
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,400
fun to see these things

504
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,919
and very proud because student

505
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,600
organizations at purdue always seem to

506
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,360
do extremely well next slide

507
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,520
so student serious students also receive

508
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,000
click line there we go the opportunity

509
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,400
to promote your own work so if you're a

510
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,360
graduate student you're probably

511
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,960
working in a lab or soon we'll be

512
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
working with a faculty member or

513
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,120
conducting research on your own

514
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,440
undergrads some of you will get involved

515
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
in research and many of you will be

516
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,679
working on class projects

517
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,840
at some point under your undergraduate

518
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
degree times

519
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,080
so we use this as an opportunity to be

520
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,720
able to help you promote your work and

521
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,320
there's a number of things we do whether

522
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,559
it's the poster session that's held at

523
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,880
the annual serious symposium or this

524
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,919
year the bi-annual series symposium

525
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,919
or opportunities throughout other events

526
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,600
to be able to promote and there's a

527
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,320
number of events outside of just sirius

528
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,480
that will be computing oriented or

529
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,039
industry specific poster sessions and so

530
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,760
we will share those with you as well

531
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,080
and then the last couple of points on

532
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,720
bullet points on this slide so if you do

533
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,679
get invited to a conference

534
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,000
to present not just a conference to

535
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,679
attend but to present

536
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,559
and the presenters or your research does

537
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,280
not cover that reach out to us we do not

538
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,200
have a large pot of money but we do have

539
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,039
a small pot of money that has been

540
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,080
donated by past students and alums

541
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,039
of purdue and and of the programs here

542
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,120
that enables us to give out small grants

543
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,280
to students who have been invited to

544
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,480
present at other at uh at conferences

545
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,320
and if you've been invited to

546
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,039
present your poster at a at a conference

547
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,320
or at the serious conference each year

548
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,039
we have complimentary poster printing uh

549
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,200
services that are available so

550
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,960
mike fakosi who's at the front of the

551
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,520
room uh and you can find his information

552
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,760
on our website as well as my information

553
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,679
and all the rest of our staff

554
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,159
just reach out and we're happy to print

555
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,080
your posters for you to take to the

556
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,159
conference or seminar that you're at

557
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,480
next

558
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,360
now there's a good looking guy in this

559
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,400
slide

560
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,400
talk about the two on the left of course

561
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,720
oh there are other things that we do and

562
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,080
this is almost the other uh slide so

563
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,880
there are routinely our faculty come up

564
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,640
affiliated faculty come up with new

565
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,320
classes they're going to offer or

566
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,400
there's a visiting scholar or a visiting

567
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,640
faculty member from another university

568
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,960
or from industry who said next semester

569
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,480
i'm going to teach this class and

570
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,240
they're typically things that are word

571
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,360
of mouth

572
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,039
that students will hear about to be able

573
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,799
to register well we try to be part of

574
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,039
that word of mouth and sharing with

575
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,360
all students regardless of department

576
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,799
who have an interest in cyber security

577
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,440
about new class offerings

578
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,000
we also throughout the year will host

579
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,080
cyber security interested students from

580
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,840
other universities

581
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,840
at this point we are planning to have

582
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,559
cyber security students from across

583
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,480
central and eastern europe come in uh in

584
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,799
january february time

585
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,480
not the time that i would recommend

586
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,559
visiting west lafayette but that works

587
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,840
for the schedule

588
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,600
so there will be opportunities for

589
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,360
serious students serious affiliated

590
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,520
students to be able to play host to

591
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
these bright students who are coming

592
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,799
from uh

593
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,559
emerging u.s partners across

594
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,640
in this case across europe but we

595
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,320
certainly have opportunities to draw

596
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,080
student visitors from other places

597
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,760
around the globe and of course from

598
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,320
other universities across indiana and

599
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
across the united states and the rest of

600
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,960
north america

601
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,360
so there are times that student projects

602
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
or graduate students or undergraduates

603
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,760
who are doing research will need

604
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,880
equipment or technical assistance

605
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,760
now we don't have a large supply of

606
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,240
every single piece of computer or

607
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,159
industrial control

608
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,400
equipment sitting in our storage but we

609
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,720
do have a sizeable amount so if you need

610
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,240
to spin up a simple it network or a

611
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,400
simple ot network or

612
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,280
a quite complex it or ot network

613
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,320
virtually on the solus laboratory we do

614
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,200
have an awful lot of equipment and uh

615
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,799
virtual research platforms that are

616
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,200
available to students for short-term

617
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,760
long-term research prop

618
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,320
research projects or class or club

619
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,880
projects so reach out to either me or to

620
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,440
adam hammer again you can find him

621
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
and i believe he's in the room as well

622
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,760
and we can help

623
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,280
we're always looking to help in our

624
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,120
students

625
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,919
and then uh several of the clubs use the

626
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,640
serious conference room as their monthly

627
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,720
meeting location so if you're looking

628
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,880
for a place to meet

629
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,919
to hold a meeting to uh to to host a

630
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,279
small event

631
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,360
uh please contact us we're happy to

632
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,960
share our facilities uh uh with you

633
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,520
also within our facilities is a quite

634
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,760
extensive cyber security lab

635
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,120
library

636
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,039
that is primarily there

637
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,440
because of professor stafford's personal

638
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,840
collection and the many books that have

639
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,679
been donated to him

640
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,760
that the years ago he said sitting at

641
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,400
home in his library look good but after

642
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,200
he's read them once uh he occasionally

643
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,679
will refer back to them but why not

644
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,799
share

645
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,440
this great resource so there is a cyber

646
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,640
security library within sirius and you

647
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,120
are able to come out in some cases you

648
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,279
can check out a book but many times you

649
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,120
just can come sign it out and and read

650
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,799
the chapters that you need or pull the

651
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,320
information you need from those books

652
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,279
right there so reach out to us lori

653
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,600
floyd again on our staff coordinates

654
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
that for us and we're happy to help you

655
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,158
next slide

656
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,240
so

657
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,600
there's also some near-term

658
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,440
opportunities that i've alluded to all

659
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,039
of these but i want to talk about in a

660
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,200
little bit greater

661
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,720
detail here

662
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,240
so throughout the academic year every

663
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,679
wednesday at 4 30 to 5 20 so almost

664
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,240
exactly preceding this event today

665
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,200
is the serious security seminar and it

666
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,600
is actually a for credit for credit

667
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,120
class computer science 591

668
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,600
but it is available to any graduate

669
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,520
student who has an interest in cyber

670
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,279
cyber physical security

671
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,840
and any upper level

672
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,000
undergraduate student so junior or

673
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,760
senior undergraduate

674
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,679
with permission from any serious

675
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,320
affiliated staff or faculty member

676
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,720
so even if you're a junior and you're

677
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,640
only now starting to get into cyber

678
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,080
security you can ask one of your

679
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,000
professors or send a note uh to me email

680
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,400
to me uh in stating that you'd like to

681
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,559
take this for credit class

682
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,480
and oftentimes we're able to approve

683
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,640
that and you can take it for credit

684
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,600
now

685
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,520
you're in a unique opportunity right now

686
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,760
because this has been for

687
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,400
traces back to 1999 when we started

688
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,960
offering this class well in the days of

689
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
the pandemic with like everything else

690
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,120
in many of her classes especially last

691
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,279
year and again this year there is the

692
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,880
virtual option

693
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,000
so

694
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,320
you can sign up and take this as a four

695
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,600
credit class

696
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,240
uh and attend virtually but because it's

697
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,880
virtual we now allow any student in

698
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,240
quite in fact

699
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,080
more uh

700
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,360
correctly

701
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,240
anybody student or no student can tune

702
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,520
in live and participate

703
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,240
in

704
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,039
the serious weekly security seminar so

705
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,320
on the bottom there is uh is a website

706
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
uh that you can click through uh you can

707
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,679
take a look at the

708
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,600
slate of presenters throughout the

709
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,720
semester

710
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,799
you can tune in live every week and

711
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,880
participate or you can tune into just

712
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,480
the weeks that you have interest

713
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,480
now if you actually do sign up for the

714
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,760
class

715
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,600
it is probably

716
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,640
the easiest class for you to pass at

717
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,760
purdue

718
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,960
because all you have to do is is

719
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,480
attend

720
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,000
throughout the semester they have these

721
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,440
if you miss

722
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,000
one or two of these classes

723
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,320
you still pass the course and it's pass

724
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,159
fail you do not get a letter grade so

725
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,440
you pass

726
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,159
if now let's say because of demands of

727
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,240
your laboratory or homework tests

728
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,399
whatever get in the way

729
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,799
you may miss three four five and now

730
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,200
you're afraid you're going to fail no we

731
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,360
make it very easy for you all you have

732
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,840
to do is go back and watch the video and

733
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,480
interestingly enough if you happen to be

734
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,440
interested in a certain specialty within

735
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,159
cyber security and this week's talk was

736
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,320
something that doesn't necessarily align

737
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,000
with your interest i would still

738
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,679
encourage you to take a look at it to

739
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,600
broaden your expertise

740
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,240
but you can go out to a keyword search

741
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,559
and find something that's right in your

742
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,960
wheelhouse watch that it doesn't matter

743
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,399
whether it was from this semester last

744
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,919
semester or from 1999 you can watch that

745
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,480
video write a short paragraph of your

746
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,640
takeaways from the video and submit it

747
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,799
to the professor of record and you will

748
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,960
be given credit for a class

749
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,840
so

750
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,799
unless you sign up for the class

751
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,080
for credit and then never attend a

752
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,720
lecture or never attend a video or never

753
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,559
watching the past videos

754
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,720
it's virtually impossible for you to

755
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,240
fail this class

756
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,480
and because the

757
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,640
slate of speakers is different every

758
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,440
year

759
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,399
you can take this class every single

760
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,120
semester at purdue now note it's an

761
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,600
elective it does not count directly

762
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,000
towards the requirements for your degree

763
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,120
but it will end up on your transcript as

764
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,000
you

765
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,799
receiving a passing grade in the serious

766
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,760
security seminar for whatever semester

767
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,240
next slide

768
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,559
please so uh the next in chronological

769
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,520
order september 20th coming up will be

770
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,320
the serious career fair

771
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,279
this in the past has been held in

772
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,679
conjunction with purdue

773
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,000
industrial roundtable for those of you

774
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,960
who are new to purdue the

775
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,520
purdue engineering student engineering

776
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,760
student council piece

777
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,200
hosts the

778
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,679
purdue engineering industrial round

779
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,000
table it's a three or four day event but

780
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,760
there are two days of it that it'll be

781
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,480
the largest career fair at purdue

782
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,000
and it started out years ago as

783
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,559
engineering focused it is broadened to

784
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,600
stem

785
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,840
based and then broadened through almost

786
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,720
any discipline it is still heavier

787
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,679
stem and business than than

788
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:46,960
excuse me than some of the other

789
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,200
departments but nearly every uh

790
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,320
department uh every college has uh

791
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,960
students who are at that job fair

792
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,120
so our event has typically coordinated

793
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,279
with that been the night uh of those two

794
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,559
day event but

795
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,440
because we have gone virtual uh and

796
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
there are and we would compete against

797
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,240
other uh campus entities that were also

798
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,600
trying to coordinate

799
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,559
their career fairs during the ir

800
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,720
we've revert moved virtual and moved it

801
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,440
a week later so on september 20th in the

802
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,320
afternoon will be the opportunity so at

803
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,120
the bottom there is a web address to be

804
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,159
able to get more information to register

805
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,919
and you must register and there's

806
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,279
actually a

807
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,679
vimeo video to be able to watch because

808
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,080
a virtual career fair is a little bit

809
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,159
different you will be still talking

810
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,320
one-on-one to a company but it will be

811
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,399
virtual and there are lines just like

812
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,200
regular uh career fairs as well so it is

813
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,559
worthwhile going take a look at the

814
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,559
short video registering and then

815
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,240
attending that uh looking for either

816
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,919
internships

817
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,480
for this summer or career opportunities

818
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,880
or even if you know those are in the

819
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,840
near term to put yourself on the radar

820
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,200
some of these companies that are

821
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,679
desperate for top talent and they may

822
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,200
not be interested in hiring you as a

823
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,960
freshman or sophomore but they're gonna

824
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
put you in their list to start tracking

825
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,640
and they need to reach out to you in a

826
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,399
year or two and say

827
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,080
how's your grades going i remember

828
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,760
meeting you two years ago we would be

829
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,440
interested if you're interested in

830
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,200
talking about opportunities at our

831
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,960
organization

832
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,519
next slide

833
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,840
and as i've mentioned several times

834
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,120
already the annual uh serious security

835
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,080
symposium this is purdue university's

836
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,480
signature cyber security event

837
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,640
when it was live and in person we would

838
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,519
have 400 plus registrants

839
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,080
and phil rooms and steward center last

840
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,080
year we went to virtual

841
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,440
hoping to do okay and we had over 700

842

many cases

862
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,720
silicon level how do we make trusted

863
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,799
systems but the other panel discussions

864
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,039
will have other topical uh

865

faculty will be the various faculty

874

across purdue will be giving that talks

875
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,880

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,520
serious symposium so take advantage of

913
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,199
this and there will be additional

914
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,800
opportunities for organizations to flag

915
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,639
that they are interested in recruiting

916
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,560
students at this event and there will be

917
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,480
a slack channel set up they can make

918
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,320
connection to it

919
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,000
regardless of whether the event is

920
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,480
virtual this semester or next semester

921
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,320
knock on wood when we hopefully move

922
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,639
back to an interest in person event

923
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,280
serious affiliated students do not pay

924
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,679
to attend this this high visibility

925
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,639
event

926
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,639
next slide

927
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,000
well guess what we're getting to the end

928
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,480
of my presentation and this is the

929
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
correct email address that i want you to

930
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,359
note

931
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,960
so all of these things that i talked

932
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,960
about and i hope a few i hope more than

933
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,400
a few of them are of interest to you

934
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,240
and the way that you put yourself and

935
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,040
start to be recognized as a serious

936
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,520
affiliated student is go to this website

937
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,680
you use your purdue credentials to log

938
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,400
in

939
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,680
and it just asks you some basic uh

940
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,599
demographic information what program you

941
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,040
are in what is your uh what what year of

942
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,400
study you in

943
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,760
where you got your other degrees if

944
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,119
you're a graduate student or an

945
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,720
undergraduate who's transferring into

946
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,079
purdue or let's say you got an

947
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,680
associate's degree and now you're

948
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
working on your bachelor's at purdue has

949
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
some basic information

950
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,119
and your research or education or career

951
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,560
interests

952
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,599
so

953
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,200
then there's opportunities for us to be

954
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,119
able to then again be the key word so

955
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,800
that we can send the right opportunities

956
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,839
to you

957
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,200
and then you'll see below there

958
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,079
optionally you can also add your resume

959
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,880
or cv to this and update it at any time

960
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,040
so there will be times that we will then

961
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,200
send out we will ask students can we

962
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,000
share your resume with our partner

963
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,560
and so unless you tell us no we'll be

964
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,880
able to share that out there and help

965
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,359
identify opportunities for you to secure

966
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,240
internships and jobs

967
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,598

987
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,200
vice president of boilers which is the

988
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,960
capture the flag team that joel uh did

989
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,240
us the

990
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,560
honor of talking about here um so

991
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,400
basically if you haven't heard of us

992
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,880
what we do is we focus on playing

993
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,839
offensive security competitions so

994
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,599
essentially every weekend there's what's

995
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,240
called a capture the flag event and some

996
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,680
organization whether it's another

997
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,000
university or another team

998
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,960
um will come up with between 10 and 40

999
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,000
challenges of just super hard hacking

1000
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,320
competition stuff they'll throw it at us

1001
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,560
we have no idea what we're doing and we

1002
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,079
just sit down and we start solving

1003
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,839
challenges so that involves things like

1004
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,400
binary exploitation which is you know

1005
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,160
come up with an exploit for a binary

1006
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,240
that causes some vulnerability to be

1007
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,160
exploited you run your own code on

1008
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,160
somebody else's server

1009
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,800
that's the classic you know every cve

1010
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,119
you see the cool ones are always binary

1011
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,400
exploitation

1012
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,240
we also have reverse engineering where

1013
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,599
we'll get

1014
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,440
again usually a binary but sometimes

1015
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,520
just a really hard to read python files

1016
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,040
and we'll send it to us and we sit down

1017
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,560
and we try and figure out exactly what

1018
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,560
it's doing usually there's some hidden

1019
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,040
functionality that we need to take apart

1020
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,640
and so we reverse engineer that and

1021
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,960
extract some sort of flag from it

1022
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,640
and then our other two categories which

1023
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,960
uh i'm not as good at but are also just

1024
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,680
as fun or web exploitation which is uh

1025
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,200
you know you look at a website you try

1026
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,640
and find vulnerabilities in it whether

1027
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,880
that's through javascript or

1028
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,280
cross-site scripting or sql injection oh

1029
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,440
thank you joel um

1030
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,520
or something like that and then finally

1031
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,119
we have cryptography

1032
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:41,920
where

1033
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,680
we try and break

1034
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,359
cryptographic protocols sometimes

1035
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,119
there's a custom protocol that has some

1036
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,119
sort of vulnerability sometimes it's a

1037
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,000
real protocol like uh tls will be

1038
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,400
implemented using some bad value that

1039
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,760
makes it so that you can decrypt the

1040
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,440
traffic things like that

1041
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,240
so

1042
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,200
we play basically every weekend um our

1043
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,400
main communication is discord um so if

1044
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,320
you go to this website all of our

1045
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,560
information about us when we meet our

1046
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,880
link to our report is on there so

1047
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,320
if you're at all interested in playing

1048
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,640
competitions with us all you have to do

1049
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,400
is join us and we will tell you what to

1050
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,160
do from there

1051
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,240
and there's two critical events coming

1052
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,400
up one is our second call out we just

1053
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,079
had one on monday so if you were there

1054
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,480
hello i missed it

1055
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,920
if you weren't there we have another one

1056
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,800
on friday it's at 6 30 p.m in lawson

1057
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,560
b155 right downstairs uh so come swing

1058
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,119
by say hello uh we'll just have

1059
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,040
essentially an extended version of this

1060
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,920
um

1061
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,480
and also a little demo of what you can

1062
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,480
expect from the types of challenges that

1063
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,440
we solve

1064
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,400
um and then our more important event is

1065
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,240
the boot camp so

1066
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,680
we don't expect people to know what

1067
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,760
they're doing in this field right away

1068
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
there's not a whole lot of classes here

1069
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,200
especially at the undergraduate level

1070
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,040
that teach anything remotely related to

1071
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,800
what we're doing until you are at least

1072
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,640
a senior so

1073
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,960
we run a boot camp for four weeks

1074
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,440
starting next monday

1075
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,960
and details about that are on our

1076
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,359
discord as well in the announcements um

1077
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,920
so twice a week for about an hour monday

1078
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,920
and friday at 6 30.

1079
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,640
we will be doing a crash course in every

1080
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,720
topic that i just talked about so it

1081
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,079
should be pretty fun if you're

1082
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,160
interested in it come learn something if

1083
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,760
you enjoy the competitions stick around

1084
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,440
and play with us

1085
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,160
our most recent top rank was fifth in

1086
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,920
the us we hit that in may and then

1087
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,760
everybody did def con and passed us so

1088
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,720
we're back down in 10th but uh

1089
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,880
yeah oh no top ten

1090
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,599
just horrible rolling two things rowan

1091
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,000
will you make sure you send me uh the

1092
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,760
information on the call out and i will

1093
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,280
send it out to all uh students who are

1094
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,680
are who are serious affiliated and then

1095
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,920
also unless i missed it i thought there

1096
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,440
is one piece of information that i think

1097
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,119
it's important for you to share

1098
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,680
that this is a club that is not just

1099
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,599
geared towards any one particular major

1100
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,160
or program you have members of your club

1101
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,119
who are from numerous majors colleges

1102
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,680
and departments across campus who all

1103
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,400
bring their expertise to your

1104
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,440
interdisciplinary competition team

1105
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,720
correct

1106
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
that's exactly right we've got you know

1107
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,720
we have a majority probably i would say

1108
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,119
of uh electrical computer engineering

1109
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,800
and computer science and data science

1110
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,720
students but we also have people who are

1111
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,119
just interested in it and come and

1112
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,960
decide that they really like it

1113
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,200
one of my favorite stories is professor

1114
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,800
former professor

1115
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,240
dennis mulnar from the physics

1116
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,880
department came and he actually first

1117
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,839
took uh professor garmin's 526 class and

1118
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,119
through that class he heard about our

1119
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,280
club and he started playing with us and

1120
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,400
he's one of our best players

1121
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,359
and

1122
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,200
before he came to our boot camp he

1123
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,560
didn't really know much about cyber

1124
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,880
security and now he's one of the one of

1125
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,839
the better hackers i know so um anybody

1126
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,920
can do it highly recommend it if you

1127
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,640
think it sounds fun come find out we're

1128
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,560
a competitive we're a competition team

1129
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,240
we're not a uh

1130
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,800
uh sit down and do class every week club

1131
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,560
so if you like to compete and you're

1132
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,160
competitive you'll probably like it

1133
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,319
another advantage to this is

1134
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,760
uh you can practice

1135
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,560
breaking systems getting into systems

1136
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,920
legally

1137
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,520
it's permitted

1138
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,000
um if you do that on your own you can

1139
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,319
get yourself in some trouble so

1140
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,560
this is a much better way to do it

1141
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,200
let me just briefly uh

1142
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,880
mention we have

1143
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,200
some of our staff present here in the

1144
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,400
room

1145
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,119
and sort of uh these are people that

1146
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,400
joel mentioned in his introduction

1147
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
it's hard to recognize people with masks

1148
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,680
i realize

1149
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,520
but nonetheless

1150
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,960
uh we'll at least give this much

1151
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,280
recognition i'll start in the back adam

1152
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,920
hammer back there

1153
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,800
is

1154
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,760
our jack of all trades when it comes to

1155
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,200
system configuration management software

1156
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,319
um if you need something to put together

1157
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,880
for a project or you're having a problem

1158
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,200
with some of our equipment

1159
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,520
he's a good person to talk to to get

1160
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,040
that resolved

1161
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,880
uh if you haven't set anything up yet

1162
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,560
then you really should go talk to joel

1163
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,520
first

1164
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,240
but

1165
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,000
adam will be the one who carries that

1166
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,240
out at the back end

1167
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,520
moving forward next up lori floyd

1168
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,880
uh laurie

1169
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,760
uh

1170
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,440
keeps track of

1171
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,160
our physical facilities the library the

1172
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,800
conference room she's the receptionist

1173
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,079
uh manages uh some of the online data

1174
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,920
does a lot of other administrative

1175
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,280
things for

1176
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,760
the center and if you were to walk into

1177
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,160
the serious offices on the second floor

1178
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,000
of recitation

1179
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,560
uh in normal times she would probably be

1180
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,920
the person that you would first meet

1181
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,480
currently because of

1182
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,280
coveted restrictions

1183
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,200
we have different people who are taking

1184
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,520
their turns and staffing the office so

1185
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,760
not everybody is there every day in

1186
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,480
person but laurie is the one that you

1187
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,640
would hear from or you would contact if

1188
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,040
you want to reserve the conference room

1189
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,760
uh or some of the facilities

1190
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,800
and then mike focusey

1191
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,000
is our webmaster data manager uh

1192
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,760
everything on the website

1193
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,680
the ftp archive

1194
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,839
a lot of the other online databases and

1195
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,440
resources he's the one who manages those

1196
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,200
and uh he is a incredibly expert in the

1197
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,920
ways of html and uh

1198
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,680
associated protocols

1199
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,240
so he's our wizard of that

1200
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,160
um

1201
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,960
we have lots of faculty i think

1202
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,440
professor garman's here

1203
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,760
and uh she teaches in this area i don't

1204
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,280
know do we have any other faculty here

1205
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,680
hiding behind a mask

1206
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,119
okay

1207
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,720
um

1208
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,800
so as joel said

1209
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,400
uh

1210
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,960
sirius uh really formally started in

1211
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,560
1998

1212
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,319
but informally started in 1992

1213
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,800
the precursor to it was a laboratory

1214
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,359
here on campus that i started

1215
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,000
so it's been going for a long time

1216
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,160
has an amazing reputation

1217
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,400
because of all the great students and

1218
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,079
faculty who've been involved over the

1219
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,839
years

1220
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,640
just this afternoon i was in my office

1221
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,560
had a knock on the door somebody i

1222
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,800
hadn't seen in about 12 years

1223
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,760
a student who graduated from here

1224
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,319
stopped by my office he's now a senior

1225
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,319
engineer at crowdstrike

1226
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,000
and he got started in security because

1227
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,359
he took cs426 from me

1228
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,119
and now is a senior engineer at

1229
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,040
crowdstrike and said

1230
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,839
because people at crowdstrike

1231
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,040
not just him

1232
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,200
but the people at crowdstrike

1233
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,359
know what a great program this is they

1234
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,000
want to come and recruit

1235
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,599
so if you're interested in a career in

1236
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,000
security they're willing to train

1237
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,599
if they can find students who have a

1238
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,000
good background in security basics and

1239
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,839
software basics

1240
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,119
they're looking

1241
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,119
what a great company

1242
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,720
uh and that's pretty much true of most

1243
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,480
of our partners

1244
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,480
joel uh

1245
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,560

computing but security as well um we we

1318

have

1319
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,800
a smaller proportion of women that are

1320
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,880
present in the general population

1321
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,920
and uh so we sis is an organization that

1322

00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,960
uh women we're

1324
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,200
sometimes feeling a real minority in the

1325
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,160
field

1326
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,480
uh to be able to

1327

and

1329
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,760
uh without some of the pressures and

1330
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,119
some of the environment that they might

1331
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,400
otherwise have in a more general

1332
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,680

the ansi uh for the group

1342
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,000
we mentioned about organizations doing

1343
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,319
recruiting and providing internships and

1344
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,000
research problems

1345
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,240
and other kinds of things

1346
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,800
these are the current partners

1347
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,640
for series

1348
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,960
i'm sure you don't recognize anything up

1349
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,839
there right

1350
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,960
you know these are major organizations

1351
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,760
internationally

1352
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,520
and

1353
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,000
you have an opportunity

1354
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,480
to find out more of what they're doing

1355
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,559
in security

1356
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,680
to possibly participate in research

1357
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,839
at every level

1358
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,280
it's not limited to just graduate

1359
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,920
students but at every level with people

1360
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,240
from these companies

1361
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,559
to get internships

1362
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,839
and maybe even job offers

1363
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:01,440
we're adding more

1364
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,680
all the time

1365
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,240
um we're somewhat selective which is why

1366
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,359
we don't have 200 up there

1367
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,759
and

1368
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,000
if you can't find somebody there who's

1369
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,240
interested in what you're doing

1370
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,079
we have other kinds of connections as

1371
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,440
well

1372
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,359
for the research that we do and for the

1373
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,040
education

1374
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,280
so with that

1375
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,599
does anybody have any questions

1376
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,440
or does anybody

1377
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,680
yeah

1378
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,240
haven't paid for all the sure you're

1379
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,160
doing if you're interested in let's say

1380
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,599
you find requests on there you're really

1381
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,800
passionate about the project can you

1382
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,160
reach out to them

1383
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,599
through there or

1384
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,720
we recommend waiting to hear

1385
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,960
what you mentioned earlier um

1386
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,680
okay so let me let me give you two-part

1387
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,040
answer

1388
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,880
the first thing is the projects that are

1389
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,559
listed on the web page

1390
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,960
are only some of the projects

1391
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,839
that are going on

1392
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:05,920
so if you don't see a project there that

1393
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,599
really catches your interest that

1394
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,160
doesn't mean there aren't any it's just

1395
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,760
those are the ones that for various

1396
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,160
reasons the faculty and the students

1397
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,400
have decided to promote by putting them

1398
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,599
up there

1399
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,559
sometimes we're doing work that is

1400
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,880
under non-disclosure and we can't talk

1401
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,480
about it so you know that's just one

1402
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,920
thing about those projects when you see

1403
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,680
them the second thing is more general

1404
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,040
and i'll tell you this as a faculty

1405
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,960
member

1406
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,040
come talk to me at any time you don't

1407
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,960
have to go through a website you don't

1408
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,680
have to wait to hear about it if you run

1409
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,240
into an article i've published or

1410
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,319
uh you see a project description or or

1411
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,000
my name is written on a bathroom wall

1412
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,280
somewhere you think it's interesting

1413
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,920
um

1414
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,440
come see me

1415
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,920
uh or or make it or make an appointment

1416
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,200
to talk to me

1417
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,880
because i'm here to work with students

1418
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,200
any of you who are interested

1419
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,040
you know let me know

1420
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,559
i may not have something you're

1421
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:07,760
interested in

1422
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,400
i may not have money to support you

1423
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,079
uh which is

1424
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,319
currently the state for most of most of

1425
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,720
my research but

1426
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,280
any of the faculty here

1427
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,520
uh if they've got a student who's really

1428
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,079
interested and is willing to work

1429
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,200
will spend time to talk to you about it

1430
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,280
so if you've identified something that

1431
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,440
looks interesting

1432
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,640
um

1433
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,760
then

1434
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,040
set up a time to talk

1435
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,359
let me give you a a clue though if you

1436
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,839
start off with

1437
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,160
i'm looking for somebody to support my

1438
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,119
my work what is it you do

1439
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,280
that isn't going to succeed

1440
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,000
you know that that does not help at all

1441
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,160
we would like students who at least have

1442
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,000
some idea what we're doing and what

1443
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,160
you're interested in to come talk to us

1444
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,720
about that

1445
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,839
if you're a little reluctant about that

1446
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,240
okay you can take a class

1447
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,920
or you can wait until you meet somebody

1448
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,680
at one of the meetings but uh don't feel

1449
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,440
intimidated

1450
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,000
i mean we have faculty here

1451
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,240
and i dare say i'm sort of one of them

1452
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,599
who have

1453
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,280
uh uh you know a distinguished career

1454
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,440
and that that may be great but we're

1455
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,520
people and we're here because we want to

1456
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,119
work with students

1457
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,440
so don't any of you be

1458
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,119
shy about

1459
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,720
coming to calculus if you're really

1460
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,960
interested

1461
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,760

1465
