and this is a special treat this week

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,480
we have someone who

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,279
um i guess we'll call them

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,840

and and pe means she has passed the

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,440
professional engineering exam with a

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,000
patent in an engineering area

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,960
she has a phd in computer science and a

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,399
law degree she's a licensed lawyer and

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,480

teaching both in law

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,719
and in cyber security

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,960
it's an incredible collection of

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,760

spans

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,880
a number of areas that we're deeply

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,400
concerned with

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,640
and that's actually the topic of her

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,880
talk she's going to be talking about the

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,920
need for legal education within a cyber

very kind words for you to say and i

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,759
hope i can live up to your expectations

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,960
um

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,920
as

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,320
he said i have this alphabet soup after

46
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,560
my name so let me let me talk about that

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,799
a little bit if my slide will move

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,640
forward you will notice by the way on

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,960
this slide that purdue trumps everything

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,119
else all right because i got my start at

51
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,119
purdue and i love purdue i was a girl

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,000
off a farm in indiana first gen to go to

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,119
college

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,119
the fourth of five daughters

55
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,119
my parents said you got two career

56
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,240
choices be a nurse or be a teacher my

57
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,479
math s.a.t scores were off the charts so

58
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,720
at that time the people would say you're

59
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,280
going to make a great math teacher

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,480
i lasted a math for about one year

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,400
and at that time there was a window of

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,040
opportunity to get into programming if

63
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,520
you didn't have a degree my degree at

64
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,720
purdue was not in computer science

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,400
in 2015 i was honored to be a

66
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,160
distinguished alumni of the mathematics

67
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,879
department and the school of science

68
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,879
and i can't remember the guy's name but

69
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,120
he from red hat the chief technical

70
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,400
officer was uh the computer science

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,720
person in the school of science and his

72
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,640
acceptance was right before mine and he

73
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,480
stood up and started talking about what

74
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,000
computer science being a student in

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,560
computer science in the 70s was like and

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,640
so i altered my speech and when i got up

77
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,239
i said i want to remind this gentleman

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,239
whatever his name was why i wasn't a

79
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,160
computer science major now i look at how

80
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,760
you guys study computer science and

81
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,040
engineering and my gosh you live in

82
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,480
heaven compared to the kind of

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,159
infrastructure we had

84
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,080
which leads me to another point not a

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
point of this topic but but you know why

86
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,000
don't we have more women but we'll leave

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,120
that one

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,040
i do have a phd from texas a m

89
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,159
university circumstances brought me here

90
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:14,959
uh

91
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,040
i worked as a software engineer in

92
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,040
various roles i started my own business

93
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
when i was getting my phd i ran a

94
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,599
business in austin for four years for uh

95
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,200
israelis

96
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,959
at that time the biggest israelis

97
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,799
software conglomerate

98
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,920
i've done research as staff said i have

99
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,040
a patent uh from one of my startups that

100
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
i got six or seven years ago

101
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
i am still a licensed attorney although

102
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,760
i don't practice that much

103
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,440
i became a registered professional

104
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,480
engineer probably for the worst reason

105
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,080
i became one because i was in austin

106
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,440
high tech for a little less than a

107
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,000
decade and i got tired of people saying

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,879
software engineers aren't real engineers

109
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,599
so now i went through all these hoops to

110
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,439
get these jobs to be registered

111
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,879
professional engineer in the state of

112
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,920
texas and

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,360
you know i'm a little bit flippant

114
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,959
sometimes but when people say software

115
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,400
engineers aren't real engineer i just

116
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
pull out my card from texas and say well

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,280
you can argue with the state of texas

118
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,319
because they say i'm a professional

119
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,360
engineer

120
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,439
there's not a big need for them as they

121
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,040
would be for civil engineers we're a

122
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
very small part of the engineering

123
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,680
community

124
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,279
and several years ago i was working with

125
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,600
a norwegian client helping write patents

126
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,560
and their

127
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
attorney said

128
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,840
i was uh

129
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,160
very good at writing claims and he

130
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,320
suggested i get my patent license which

131
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,600
i did i practiced patent law for a short

132
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,160
period of time i came to a m and i had a

133
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,759
tragedy when my partner that i was

134
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,040
working within patent law suddenly

135
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,840
passed away so i poured all my energy

136
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,360
into a m

137
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,360
uh i teach cybersecurity law and i teach

138
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,120
cybersecurity risk

139
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,040
and with my role in the law school about

140
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
two years ago i developed a plan for

141
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,560
them

142
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,120
for their non-law masters the masters of

143
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,320
jurisprudence you're not you're not

144
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,759
required to be a lawyer like you would

145
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,000
with an llm program and i developed a

146
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,720
cyber security management track because

147
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,039
i saw in my work with industry i just

148
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,880
finished uh training with a large

149
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,120
aerospace company in fort worth

150
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,440
that you know we concentrate a lot on

151
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,280
the technical aspects of cyber security

152
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,639
but there's this large community of

153
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,039
people who have to work with us or talk

154
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,039
to us or manage projects

155
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,120
and they implemented that plan they

156
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,639
forgot to tell me until about a year

157
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,960
later and that program is up and running

158
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,440
so i'm i've got my uh

159
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,560
got my fingers in a lot of pies at a m

160
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,240
and you know people don't like lawyers

161
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,639
you know lawyers are when do we see

162
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,400
lawyers we see lawyers when something

163
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,560
bads happen we're being sued we have to

164
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,680
sue

165
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,759
you know family dispute

166
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,720
um and and in full disclosure when

167
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,880
either of my children liked math or

168
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,400
science i think there was a mix-up in

169
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,000
the nursery when they were born and both

170
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,280
of them are very

171
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,520
successful lawyers in houston

172
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,840
so my my talk today is why are we

173
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
including law in a cyber security

174
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,720
curriculum

175
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,199
and i i want this

176
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,120
i'm very passionate about this topic and

177
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,360
here's why here's my observation

178
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,240
first of all there's a pragmatic reason

179
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,479
pragmatically i see and i'm i'm speaking

180
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,720
from texas a m okay i'm speaking from

181
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,639
what i see at texas a m we have some

182
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,639
constraints here we have a law that you

183
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,680
have to be able to get a bachelor's

184
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,960
degree in 120 hours okay so

185
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,039
that really crams a lot

186
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,960
but what i see is

187
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,600
that we don't adequately prepare our

188
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,039
students in the non-technical skills

189
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,280
we send our students out in engineering

190
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,120
and computer science computer science at

191
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,960
a m is in the college of engineering not

192
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,800
in the college of science

193
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,000
and

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,080
they're going to and i saw this in

195
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,560
austin i saw very smart technical people

196
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,080
being taken advantage of because they

197
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,520
didn't know the basics of law they

198
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,599
didn't know contract law they signed

199
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,440
employment agreements

200
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,800
they would be told something and they

201
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,880
believed it to be true which wasn't true

202
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,479
they didn't know how to

203
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,319
protect intellectual property or who

204
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,639
owned what now that's not the basis of

205
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,720
my talk that's just another need we have

206
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,880
i want to focus this talk on why it is

207
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,120
extremely important to teach law and

208
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,360
cyber security curriculum

209
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
and i want you to think about this i put

210
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,120
this in the abstract for the talk

211
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,639
that

212
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,240
every time you put your hands on the

213
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,080
keyboard you don't even have to be a

214
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,759
cyber worker you could be a civil

215
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,599
engineer you can be doing software

216
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,639
development you don't want anything to

217
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,639
do with cyber security but you're

218
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,479
interacting in that world

219
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,080
and every time you put your hands on the

220
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,560
keyboard you're operating in a very

221
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,759
uncertain

222
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,880
legal and ethical framework

223
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,919
and

224
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,840
you can you know the classic example i

225
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,479
use in my classes i can be in houston

226
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,599
texas and i have clients that um

227
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,879
you know

228
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,039
i don't know are european citizens and

229
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,280
their data is being processed and i'm

230
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,000
doing something for when i'm under

231
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,240
an eu law

232
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,360
and not only that more and more people

233
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,080
in workers whatever you're doing you're

234
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,560
seeing privacy data

235
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,319
they're under different legal

236
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,560
regimes you're seeing intellectual

237
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,400
property you're getting burdened but yet

238
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,479
we don't adequately prepare people for

239
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,599
this

240
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,479
so i came to texas a m uh four years ago

241
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,240
july of 2017

242
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,160
and i developed two classes one cyber

243
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,879
security law and policy and the other

244
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,800
cyber security risk

245
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,680
i teach this class differently than even

246
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,400
the the fellow whose textbook i use

247
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,080
i teach this class i don't want to make

248
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,360
you lawyers

249
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,320
okay

250
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,159
the world's got enough lawyers

251
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,240
i want to make you legal savvy tech

252
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,760
workers in whatever vocation career job

253
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,120
that you have

254
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,959
i want to build in my students the

255
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,519
ability to develop a legal analysis

256
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,800
framework

257
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,880
how i teach this class today is so

258
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,320
different than how i taught it three

259
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,680
years ago

260
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,920
why things change

261
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,320
and it's going to be different when i my

262
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,839
students graduate and they go out and

263
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,399
take jobs and in five years so instead

264
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,560
of we teach the basics of law and the

265
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,240
understanding of the current laws but

266
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,640
one of my overarching goals is

267
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,720
if you're hitting a situation do you

268
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,959
know how to analyze that

269
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,560
do you know where you would go to look

270
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,000
for answers

271
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,519
do you know when you have to raise your

272
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,120
hand and say i think we need legal

273
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,360
counsel for this right

274
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,839
so it's been an exciting experience that

275
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,760
i want to share with you so that's the

276
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,600
pragmatic reason

277
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,360
right that we don't prepare our students

278
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,200
as much as we should

279
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,800
but i actually did a little work and i

280
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,399
don't represent nist but i wanted to

281
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,399
talk about this work from their nist

282
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,240
nice framework national initiative and

283
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,760
cyber security education and when i

284
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,040
first developed my law and policy class

285
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,760
i went through the nisnice framework

286
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,800
and

287
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,120
we tend to think you know whatever our

288
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,040
going to be like everybody i know in

289
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,560
cyber here they're really good software

290
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,399
engineers and not everybody but a lot of

291
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,080
them want to be pen testers right or

292
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,279
they want to do this they want to be

293
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,360
threat analysts or something

294
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,440
um and i and i i don't know if you're

295
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,959
familiar with this noise framework it

296
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,760
starts with 52 seven big categories then

297
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,320
52 work roles and some specialty areas

298
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,360
and it is

299
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,760
detailed beyond comprehension almost

300
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,600
and it has 630 knowledge descriptions

301
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,040
and i'll show you some in a few minutes

302
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,200
the knowledge business

303
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,279
and then it defines each work role and

304
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,959
the different tasks so you have all

305
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,000
these mappings of this work role over

306
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,760
these kind of tasks but maybe this work

307
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,279
world has some of those tasks and the

308
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,240
like develops into skills i think i'm

309
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,519
i'm hearing from this they're going to

310
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,040
drop the abilities

311
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,200
so i went through this rigorously and

312
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,680
i'll tell you how in a minute and then i

313
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,360
found out that there were only one or

314
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
two of these work roles that required a

315
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,200
law degree and the reason it's one or

316
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,240
two

317
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,120
is because

318
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,079
one of them definitely

319
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,040
asked as the cyber legal advisor

320
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,880
gives legal advice and when you say

321
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,959
gives legal advice you're talking about

322
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,120
you need a lawyer

323
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,519
the other is a privacy officer which

324
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,120
could be a lawyer but doesn't have to be

325
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,720
so that's why there's only one or two so

326
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,920
out of these 52 work rules only one

327
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,680
requires a law degree

328
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,720
but yet when i analyzed the data i did a

329
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,000
manual search on all of these terms

330
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,680
and keep in mind first of all i'm doing

331
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,440
this manually and i'm writing it down on

332
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,959
notebook paper so i could have made a

333
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,720
mistake right maybe i missed a term i

334
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,920
come up with all the words that could

335
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,079
come up with legal law privacy counsel

336
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,640
regulation executive order right

337
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,560
and i find out that while it seems like

338
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,800
a small number of tasks out of the

339
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,519
hundred and thousand seven rather and

340
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,680
maybe a small number statistically the

341
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,200
knowledge descriptions that when you

342
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,600
look at these mappings

343
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,279
there are

344
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,800
through the need for law and regulations

345
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,079
knowledge is actually in every work role

346
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,519
because if you're familiar with this

347
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,760
nice framework the first six

348
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
is in uh

349
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,360
every work role

350
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
and one of it is knowledge of laws and

351
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,600
regulations the other by the way another

352
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,360
one is knowledge of cybersecurity risk

353
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,200
so i've got both classes covered in

354
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,600
every work role there's a minimum amount

355
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,120
of legal knowledge that you need

356
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,760
so i took this so let me give you two

357
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
examples

358
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,040
this is uh the work role of system

359
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,120
architecture

360
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,680
and develops system concepts works on

361
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,320
the capability data and then translates

362
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,240
technology in environmental conditions

363
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,839
and then in parentheses eg the law and

364
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,120
regulation into system and security

365
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,839
designs and processes

366
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,560
so if you want to be a system architect

367
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,120
and you go through the work role and you

368
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,240
look through the knowledge and the

369
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,839
skills and you've got the abilities and

370
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,720
you understand the task you have to know

371
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,760
some level of law and regulations

372
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,079
and you have to ask yourself

373
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,839
how am i going to incorporate these into

374
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,120
systems designs and processes how am i

375
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,880
going to

376
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,519
know that i'm compliant what is going to

377
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,240
be my

378
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,920
liability or the liability that i put my

379
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,440
company in

380
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,800
if i don't do this correctly

381
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,079
and i want you to and what i've learned

382
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,600
every time i teach this class every

383
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,920
semester i teach it differently

384
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,880
um

385
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,760
one of the uh insights i had this year

386
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,200
was that

387
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,320
i can take the laws that i teach

388
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,480
and some of them affect

389
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,880
would affect you individually i'm going

390
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,120
into this this week just about the time

391
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,720
the classes you know people are

392
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,240
listening to me and they're starting to

393
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,680
get a little overwhelmed with the laws

394
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,199
and then i say you're ever going to go

395
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,959
to federal prison it's going to be you

396
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,279
violated one of these two laws you as an

397
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,279
individual right because they're federal

398
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,320
laws

399
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,839
and i always tell the story of aaron

400
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
schwartz who was tried under or who was

401
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,199
going to be tried under the cfaa

402
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,880
um

403
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,560
and and i usually do not give my

404
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,160
personal opinion when i teach but in

405
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,399
that case i say it's clear prosecutorial

406
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,839
overreach prosecutor overreach was was

407
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,600
insane that drove this young man to

408
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,519
commit suicide

409
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,880
um

410
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,680
so the first category laws is what are

411
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,880
those that

412
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,040
you could be liable for

413
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,199
you could have civil

414
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,279
which means lawsuits with your personal

415
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,839
liability or

416
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,600
criminal implications

417
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,480
the second class of laws are those laws

418
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,639
that you could be working for a company

419
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,279
or an entity and create liability for

420
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,199
them

421
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,680
and the third set are laws that i don't

422
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,680
look at that much depth in the class

423
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,519
because there's so many of them but this

424
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,199
is putting restrictions on the

425
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,600
government the government's ability to

426
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,839
get to data

427
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,760
i go over these because everyone needs

428
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,279
to know these they're in addition to

429
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,199
your rights that are protected by your

430
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,440
first fourth fifth and sixth and

431
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,120
fourteen amendments

432
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,600
um but there's three ways to look at the

433
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,880
law

434
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,199
so you know going back to this

435
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,720
um

436
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
one of these

437
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,959
laws or one of these knowledge of those

438
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,279
laws is and something that a lot of

439
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,040
people wouldn't think about being a

440
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,720
system architect

441
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,519
you know

442
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,720
think of what you need to know

443
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
technically to do that

444
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,959
but is there a requirement to kind of

445
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,480
look at this and say wait a minute what

446
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,120
laws and regulations

447
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,639
do i need to know

448
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,160
and how am i going to trace it i think

449
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,680
it would be a fascinating course and i

450
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,279
don't know how to do it

451
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,120
if you took a lot of these compliance

452
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,000
issues and say can i actually trace them

453
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,680
to where i can see that they are

454
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,360
incorporated in the software i'm

455
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,720
developing or the hardware i'm

456
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,560
developing if you're not a software

457
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,079
person

458
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,600
i did a training session for mid-career

459
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,000
software engineers and compliance people

460
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,759
a large aerospace company in fort worth

461
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,480
texas a couple of summers ago

462
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,360
and

463
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,560
uh

464
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,320
the compliance person that was head of

465
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,480
compliance so you had very two diverse

466
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,920
groups you had software engineers who

467
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,839
knew a lot of this basics but they

468
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,120
didn't know how to do cyber security

469
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,560
because they had been you know out of

470
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,480
school 20 some years and then you had

471
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,759
these compliance people that didn't know

472
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,199
how to do software but they knew all the

473
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,519
compliance issues and they gave me a

474
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,160
list of all the compliance regulations

475
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
that drove them and it was like 200

476
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,199
different

477
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,120
either laws regulations executive orders

478
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,440
industry standards whatever was

479
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,000
governing their product going to the dod

480
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,839
you know and it was just overwhelming

481
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,759
and that's why i got the idea how could

482
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,759
you even take this

483
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,519
and know that you are properly

484
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,199
incorporating this

485
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,680
into the final product

486
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,639
okay

487
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,360
another one that comes up is the threat

488
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,480
analysis

489
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,639
so you want to be a threat analyst right

490
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,880
well guess what

491
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,639
one of the

492
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,639
uh

493
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,560
the work role definition

494
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,959
defined by nist is you have to be able

495
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,359
to help initialize or support law

496
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,959
enforcement

497
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,880
well this is a fascinating conversation

498
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,359
we could have right are you acting for

499
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,119
an agent of the government because if

500
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,720
you are

501
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,480
you can't you have to get fourth

502
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
amendment compliant warrants

503
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,319
and i always love it on tv where you

504
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,079
know you see these cop shows and the

505
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,760
policeman says i'll go get a warrant for

506
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,959
the judge

507
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,400
and it's like you go to a vending

508
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,160
machine pop out warrant what you need

509
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,520
and hit the button and that's not the

510
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
way it works

511
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,480
you know there's four elements of the

512
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,840
fourth amendment

513
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,039
um one of which is by author affirmation

514
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,880
was there probable cause are you going

515
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,720
to particularly describe this you know

516
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,400
the right to protect people and their

517
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,240
persons and their effects and their

518
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,840
houses

519
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,160
what i love about american history and

520
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,720
the law is that these

521
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,559
amendments were written in 1789

522
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,720
and so part of our challenge is how do

523
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,679
you interpret the constitution

524
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,559
in a digital and virtual world

525
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,799
how do you interpret a fifth amendment

526
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,400
right let's say

527
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,799
against self-incrimination which does

528
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,280
that mean i gotta give you my

529
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,320
password to my computer or cell phone

530
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,720
and if and some courts will say that's

531
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,400
protected by your fifth amendment right

532
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,640
now others will say that's not

533
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,919
they use different court analogies

534
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,240
one court said if it's biometric it's of

535
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,720
your fingerprint you have no

536
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,400
protection

537
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,160
so

538
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,559
okay i'm confused it's that old legal

539
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,360
thing it depends right it depends on a

540
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,200
lot of factors

541
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,799
so when you look at let's say go back to

542
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,200
threat analysis how is evidence bagged

543
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,880
and tagged you know if you're you know

544
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,160
that's that's

545
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,679
the word uh one of my friends that's the

546
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,400
ciso always used that came from nsa and

547
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,480
he's a seasoned at a larger

548
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,000
oil and gas communications company

549
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,600
and you know how do you how do you

550
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,000
provide that chain of custody

551
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,799
where in your classwork an undergraduate

552
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,720
or graduate has that process ever been

553
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,480
defined

554
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,799
and then what evidence can you legally

555
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,039
gather without a search for it

556
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,200
because the fourth amendment prohibits

557
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,080
the government

558
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,039
requires the government to have a fourth

559
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,200
amendment compliance search warrant but

560
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,240
also agents of the government

561
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,320
so i work for a uh public entity as is

562
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,600
purdue

563
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,960
uh if i did anything i'm actually acting

564
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,720
i could be construed as being an agent

565
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,679
of the government right if my fellow

566
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,600
friends that teach at rice university

567
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,440
it's a private university they can they

568
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,120
can get away with things we couldn't get

569
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,720
by with right

570
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,280
so i love this when i teach my students

571
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,360
because it's a little bit eye-opening

572
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,039
today's wednesday yesterday in class i

573
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,880
said i'm going to give this talk before

574
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,799
class starts anybody you know you're in

575
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,799
your fourth week of class

576
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,559
what have you learned so far one of the

577
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,840
students said

578
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,880
you know

579
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,960
i haven't learned this yet but

580
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,600
i never realized work i could be doing

581
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,480
could be legal or illegal and is there

582
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,039
guidance that you can give us you know

583
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,880
because i don't want to do something

584
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,960
wrong right

585
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,320
which which is kind of interesting

586
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,840
because that's exactly what the course

587
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,760
is supposed to be teaching you

588
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,080
um

589
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,159
so so let's talk about these knowledge

590
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,159
units and and i don't work for nist i

591
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,600
just want to tell you this is how i did

592
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,960
the analysis of my course and as i said

593
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,320
the first

594
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,000
six

595
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,320
are required in every work role so there

596
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,919
is a knowledge of laws regulations

597
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,600
policy and ethics as they relate to

598
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,840
cyber security and privacy required for

599
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,120
everything

600
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,360
right these others are just ones i

601
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,120
picked up like i said there were i can't

602
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,559
remember the exact number i told you but

603
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,039
there's uh 60 or 70 of these knowledge

604
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,320
units

605
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
and so i want to go back to how i did

606
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,120
this

607
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,600
i did this by a manual search

608
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,000
so i came up with a list of terms that

609
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,559
an exhaustive list i thought one

610
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,840
two i recorded it on yellow pad paper

611
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,679
right because i couldn't find a better

612
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,919
way to do it

613
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,840
and i wanted to be sure that my class

614
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,159
was not only compliant with abet and

615
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,159
compliant with other standards and we

616
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,480
have another standard the designation

617
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,159
here from the nsa

618
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,520
um

619
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,200
but i wanted to be sure i was covering

620
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
all this plus i wanted to be sure that

621
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,280
when i had students in my class and i

622
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,720
said what do you want to do and they say

623
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,480
i want to be a pen tester what do pen

624
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,919
testers do

625
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,320
well you know we do this and this

626
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,000
okay what's the legal implications of

627
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,440
this you know people say i want to be a

628
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,880
consultant and do pen testing that

629
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,640
sounds really exciting please set

630
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
yourself up as an llc or a private

631
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,880
entity and be sure you have a contract

632
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,240
you know

633
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,760
that's that's going back to the basic

634
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,400
law they should know but also the cyber

635
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,480
security law that they should know

636
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,679
um

637
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,000
and what is the risk in doing that job

638
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,480
so here's some of the questions

639
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,559
that students don't understand but think

640
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,000
they do

641
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,760
so let me give you some examples that i

642
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,600
teach that i teach i teach from a

643
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,640
textbook

644
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,159
but i don't start the textbook until the

645
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,360
second week

646
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,000
my students are computer scientists

647
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,640
uh engineers i've had aerospace

648
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,159
engineers mechanical engineers civil

649
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,440
engineers i've had people from the

650
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,640
architecture department and our

651
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,880
visualization i get people from the mays

652
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,400
business school here i'm from the george

653
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,240
bush school of uh service and public

654
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,679
policy so a lot of them are not coders

655
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,440
in fact in our last faculty meeting they

656
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,640
were talking about

657
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,960
i'm sure as it is at purdue we're just

658
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,080
you know we get so many applications and

659
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,679
we have you know we're bursting the

660
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,280
scenes here trying to trying to keep

661
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,120
everybody uh

662
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,320
happy

663
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,559
and uh the graduate advisor said they

664
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,760
have people coming in from different

665
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,360
engineering patrolling mechanical i'm

666
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,640
going to get a master's in computer

667
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,080
science and he said so i tell them to

668
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,520
take paul's classes because they don't

669
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,600
have to know how to code and we'll catch

670
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
them up on coding and i was sitting like

671
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
is that a good thing or a bad thing

672
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,120
it's kind of like i was a you know last

673
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,720
resort

674
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,880
one of the biggest issues we have right

675
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,039
now is jurisdiction

676
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,600
so let me use this analogy if i walk out

677
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,480
today and my car's been stolen

678
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,159
and i think okay what time did i get

679
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,520
here this morning

680
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,440
how far could that car gotten let's say

681
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,000
in six hours it's highly unlikely

682
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,520
someone's going to

683
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,720
fly a plane and put my car on a plane

684
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,000
right

685
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,039
uh so it's so far away

686
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,000
they catch whoever stole my car

687
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,159
and without a doubt texas has

688
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,240
jurisdiction you know unless they

689
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,000
managed to get across the state line or

690
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,440
they had a conspiracy where they're

691
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,960
buying you know getting cars and doing

692
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
this and that texas has jurisdiction

693
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,640
because it's physical

694
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,320
the car is physical and if i say you

695
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,760
know what

696
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,360
louisiana law

697
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,960
there's different penalties for car

698
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,400
thieves and i don't know if this is true

699
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
but i'm just saying if so i want this

700
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,640
under louisiana law i was in louisiana

701
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,279
in august you know i like louisiana i

702
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,120
like going to new orleans right can't

703
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,720
you just do louisiana

704
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,559
the answer would be no

705
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,200
but here's the issue our laws were

706
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,400
developed for a physical world

707
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,520
not a digital world

708
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,320
so if my data is stolen

709
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,039
who has jurisdiction

710
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,440
right the internet doesn't understand

711
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,520
geographic boundaries you know so my

712
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,960
data's stolen

713
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,480
and country

714
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,200
out of country in country c

715
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,520
but along the way they steal it from me

716
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,679
as a resident of houston texas

717
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,080
and they use the resources of company of

718
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,240
country b and c

719
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,600
who has

720
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,919
who has jurisdiction it's one issue and

721
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,799
maybe all three

722
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
the other notion of jurisdiction that is

723
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,600
difficult for students to understand is

724
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,840
with the the rise of general data

725
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,960
protection regulation gdpr

726
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,279
that you can be just working away in

727
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,440
texas or wherever and suddenly you are

728
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,360
under the extra territorial jurisdiction

729
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,840
of gdpr if in fact you're processing

730
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,159
data on citizens or residents of the eu

731
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,520
under some restrictions where the

732
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,159
processing has taken place so

733
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,840
jurisdiction is one of the biggest

734
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,200
issues

735
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,279
then just about the time students think

736
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,880
they understand jurisdiction we talk

737
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,520
about standing and i love standing

738
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,600
standing just means the right to bring a

739
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,679
suit and we all have it under article 3

740
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,760
of the constitution

741
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,520
the problem with this and i'll get to

742
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,520
this in a minute on the graphic is um

743
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,840
standing is a federal it's a

744
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,199
constitutional right

745
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,880
it our

746
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,440
elements of standing actually came from

747
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,400
a death penalty case in arkansas

748
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,440
in 1991 with our current laws about

749
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,559
standing

750
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,640
but the concept of standing is

751
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,640
interpreted differently depending on

752
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,720
where you reside in the u.s

753
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,080
and let me tell you this is where

754
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,559
students just like okay stop repeat that

755
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,320
how did this happen

756
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,159
well the supreme

757
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,159
law in the united states is a supreme

758
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,600
court

759
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
so unless it goes to the supreme court

760
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,880
you can have different appellate

761
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,320
districts and i'll show your graphic in

762
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,240
a minute interpret it differently and we

763
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,919
have that currently

764
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,320
the seventh circuit in chicago

765
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,360
versus the third circuit out of delaware

766
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,279
interprets the elements of standing

767
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,640
differently now listen to what i'm

768
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,799
saying they have to have the elements of

769
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,840
standing there's three elements

770
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,640
but they interpret them differently

771
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,159
and of course someone i bring up the

772
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,919
death penalty case

773
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,400
of standing in arkansas i always get

774
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,360
this but that has nothing to do with

775
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,760
you know cyber security or data breaches

776
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,919
or this or that and that's another big

777
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,159
difference between the technical mind

778
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,679
and the legal mind

779
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,840
technology does this it just you know

780
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,240
runs up exponentially

781
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,080
the law does is do do

782
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,400
do do do do and it always likes

783
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,240
technology

784
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,799
and a base is based on precedent

785
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,240
you gotta find it in a court opinion you

786
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,120
gotta find it in a statute

787
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,960
if i were giving a technical talk and

788
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,600
let's say i have invented a new way

789
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,679
to stream music that requires no

790
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,159
hardware just i train your mind and you

791
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,120
know whatever something crazy

792
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,720
but i started that

793
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,880
that discussion talking about edison

794
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,120
inventing the phonograph and then we

795
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,159
went to you know 33 and the thirds and

796
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,600
45 rpms and cassettes and eight tracks

797
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,760
and then we get the history of the ipods

798
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,360
and you'd be like why are we listening

799
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,200
to what does this have to do with us

800
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,360
tell us about the technology

801
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,600
but in law we constantly go back to

802
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,360
precedent

803
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,039
so a few years ago there was a case in

804
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,120
san bernardino

805
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,919
uh where some uh people were shot and

806
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,559
killed at a uh christmas party and there

807
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,559
was a case because they were missing

808
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,080
something like 18 minutes of these

809
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,880
people's lives and so they um

810
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,760
wanted to get apple to de-encrypt the

811
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,520
apple phone

812
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,840
and

813
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,000
they used a

814
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,520
a law

815
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,039
of roots

816
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,600
from like 1789 or something and some of

817
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
the commentators would write well this

818
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,399
is really silly they didn't have

819
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,760
computers then they didn't do this or

820
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,880
they didn't do this they didn't have

821
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
encryption how can they do this that's

822
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,760
because the biggest challenge to develop

823
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,679
a legal analysis

824
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,799
is to realize that the law is about

825
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,399
process

826
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,520
it is about the process that law which

827
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,039
is still good law because the supreme

828
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,399
court united states has never

829
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,799
invalidated that law it's about the

830
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,000
process of gathering evidence

831
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,520
so we look at jurisdiction the

832
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,120
difference between laws written for the

833
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,279
physical world our constitution most of

834
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,279
our amendments the bill of rights all

835
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,600
1789 you know

836
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,320
uh our notion of standing that's that's

837
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,760
not even the word standing is never in

838
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,200
the constitution but has been

839
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
interpreted the fact that you could have

840
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
a death penalty case

841
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,279
the structure of american courts where

842
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,760
you have your fact-finding court

843
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
at the state and federal level

844
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,279
the only way you get to the appellate

845
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,600
court in your state or federal is a

846
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,440
mistaken law

847
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,919
people don't understand this either your

848
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,679
your lowest courts the fact-finding

849
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,760
court by either judge or jury your

850
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,159
middle court is your fact-finding uh

851
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,840
excuse me sure has to have a mistake in

852
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,520
law and it has to be in the written

853
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,440
record so again forget what you watch on

854
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
tv where somebody objects and

855
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,120
the judge overrules it and they all sit

856
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,320
down no

857
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,679
they're going to get it in writing while

858
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,279
i was over the world

859
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,880
because that's the only thing you can

860
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,360
get to that appellate level did the jury

861
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,520
get the wrong instructions were people

862
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,880
excluded from the jury that shouldn't

863
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,120
been excluded did the judge let in

864
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,840
evidence he shouldn't have or

865
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,520
not let in evidence he should have

866
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,080
whatever it has to be mistaken law and

867
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,399
then in every state and the federal we

868
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,480
have the supreme courts

869
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,120
texas is really interesting texas is

870
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,120
just a strange place you know we like to

871
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,880
think we're there a whole other country

872
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,880
we actually have two supreme courts one

873
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,799
of them is called get this the supreme

874
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,919
court

875
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,120
all right

876
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,039
we have district courts we have the

877
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,720
appellate courts there's 14 of them in

878
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,080
texas

879
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,000
depending on where you live then we have

880
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,760
two supreme courts one is called the

881
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,360
supreme court and let's listen to

882
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,200
several cases and the other is the court

883
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
of criminal appeals which is the supreme

884
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
court for criminal

885
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,960
so people outside of texas will hear a

886
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,640
court of criminal appeals and think it's

887
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,240
at the second level it's like no it's at

888
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,039
the third level you know

889
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,039
it's texas what can i say we also have

890
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,480
something called the texas railroad

891
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,640
commission that regulates oil and gas we

892
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,080
don't do the old remember the old

893
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,760
computer stuff call by name call by

894
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,360
value yeah we don't do the call by name

895
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,960
very well

896
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,320
another thing we talk about is the

897
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,080
standards of evidence

898
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,600
you know that you have a civil more

899
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,200
likely than not

900
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,720
you have a clear and condensate

901
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,080
convincing

902
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,360
and then you have beyond a reasonable

903
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,799
doubt for criminal and when they come

904
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,200
into effect so my first week this is

905
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,360
what i'm talking about

906
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
uh we talk about separation of power the

907
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,000
executive the legislative and the uh

908
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,240
judicial and we tend to think our laws

909
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,960
come just from the congress or our

910
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,120
legislature in our state well you know

911
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,799
we have these court opinions you know

912
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,640
the supreme court brown v board of

913
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,519
education roe v wade lawrence v texas

914
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,320
okay

915
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,399
but they don't also realize that an

916
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,279
executive order from the president

917
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,159
directing only executive agencies which

918
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,399
is everything other than the courts and

919
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,799
congress under his power have the full

920
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,240
effect of law

921
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,440
and so one of the things i do rigorously

922
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
is first of all i teach people how to

923
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,679
read a law i'll be doing that tomorrow

924
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,480
on the cfa computer fraud and abuse act

925
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
because if you're ever going to go to

926
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,440
prison as an individual that's a that's

927
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,600
a very likely one and i show them how

928
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,360
you read it and it's not like you read a

929
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,720
stephen king novel where you start at

930
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,320
the beginning and you read the end you

931
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,919
go through and you figure out the

932
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,760
outline of the law

933
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,840
you look at the definitions of the law

934
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,840
you look at the causes under the cfa for

935
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,519
example we have seven

936
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,880
you look at the fact that there's two

937
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,799
lines in that law that talks about

938
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,200
conspiracy and you think two lines what

939
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,519
can that mean and that long law and then

940
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,760
you find out that's very powerful to all

941
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,200
two lines

942
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,279
then they're criminal penalties

943
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,120
right so i teach them how to read the

944
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,000
law

945
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,760
the other thing i teach them is how to

946
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,200
read an executive order from the

947
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,519
president i think we have this notion

948
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,360
that uh our president you know gets up

949
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,039
in the morning and picks up a form that

950
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,799
says executive order and says i know

951
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,640
what i feel like doing today how about

952
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,159
an executive order that everybody has to

953
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,720
wear pink hats on tuesday yay right but

954
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,159
it turns out the executive order

955
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,640
has a certain form and format

956
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,240
and the first thing the president does

957
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,840
is call on his powers under the

958
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,919
constitution

959
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,760
and then depending on different things

960
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,919
he can he or she if we have a female

961
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,840
person can ever only direct federal

962
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,120
agencies under his con her control

963
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,880
and then at the end there's always this

964
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,880
disclaimer that this creates no right

965
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,960
and privilege for anybody but the

966
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,880
federal government so in other words you

967
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,760
can't use an executive order

968
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,799
to create your own right of action

969
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,240
pretty powerful

970
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,080
and that the only reason you can ever

971
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,840
avoid an executive order and they go

972
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,679
directly to the supreme court is if they

973
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:22,840
violate the

974
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,360
constitution otherwise they can be

975
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,120
totally unreasonable but unless they

976
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,479
violate the constitution

977
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,880
which is also something i don't have

978
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,600
listed here per se but you teach people

979
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,279
that the only question the supreme court

980
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,840
of the united states ever asked

981
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,039
is this action constitution

982
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,480
that's it

983
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,320
that's it and they are truly the supreme

984
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,080
court of the united states because they

985
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,360
don't have to follow the rules of the

986
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,080
apollo courts they can do de novo you

987
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,600
know start and look at everything they

988
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,960
can decide what they want to do they can

989
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,480
decide what cases they want to hear

990
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,519
whatever

991
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,919
so these are just some of the the topics

992
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,039
i cover

993
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,159
i talk a lot about the amendments

994
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,519
you know everybody loves like i always

995
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,799
say everybody loves the first amendment

996
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,560
until you don't right until it's used

997
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,639
against you but there's five aspects the

998
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,560
establishment of religion i just read

999
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,079
today that they're coming after texas

1000
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,440
the department of justice is coming

1001
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,359
after texas because our governor has

1002
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,359
said you can't mandate mask

1003
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,639
and they're saying that basically

1004
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,560
establishes a you know religious type

1005
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,239
thing and i'm like i don't understand

1006
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,079
that point but you know good luck with

1007
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,199
that one

1008
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,359
uh that how powerful our first amendment

1009
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,280
protections are but everybody gets a

1010
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
queasy feeling in their safe stomach

1011
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,879
when you find out that the supreme court

1012
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,199
in 1969 ruled that the clan could build

1013
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,560
it burn across on a hill near cincinnati

1014
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,760
unless there was an imminent threat of

1015
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,159
danger that's protected speech

1016
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,760
spoiler alert it's not in other

1017
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,520
countries

1018
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,918
england really recently lost a lot of

1019
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,879
soccer games in the euro cup and there

1020
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,359
were some players who were

1021
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,079
from uh minorities and they were called

1022
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,880
out on social media by individuals in

1023
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,720
the united states

1024
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,480
we can't do anything about that in the

1025
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,960
uk they were arrested

1026
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,720
because they didn't threaten there was

1027
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,440
no imminent threat there was just ugly

1028
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,280
pejorative racist comments made and

1029
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,800
under uk law they don't have first

1030
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,640
amendment protections

1031
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,000
you know we talk about fourth amendment

1032
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,200
compliance search warrants what does

1033
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,359
that mean in the digital age

1034
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,359
what does that mean probable cause what

1035
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,680
can i search if it says you know

1036
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,920
person's house is effects

1037
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,200
written in 1789 what does that mean and

1038
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,280
and what are the cases that are that are

1039
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,280
edging this out which an important case

1040
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,079
was carpenter um the carpenter case in

1041
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,400
june of 2018 which said

1042
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,880
we've had this third-party precedent

1043
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,079
since the 50s we're not undoing it

1044
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:46,960
but

1045
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,880
this guy he was tracked criminally by

1046
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,520
geolocation data on his phone they

1047
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,280
should have gotten a search warrant in

1048
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,160
this case because these guys our mobile

1049
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
phones have become such a part of who we

1050
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,000
are we carry so much of our personal

1051
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,520
life although the supreme court said in

1052
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,960
their opinion

1053
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,240
okay

1054
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,760
talk about the fifth amendment against

1055
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,839
self-incrimination alike

1056
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,400
and the biggest ones are we don't we i

1057
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,880
teach that we have definitions that are

1058
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,960
legal and we have definitions that are

1059
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,240
technical

1060
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,880
and in the law guess what trumps if

1061
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,040
there's a legal definition

1062
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,440
it trumps a technical definition if

1063
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,520
there's no legal definition it goes to

1064
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,560
the common ordinary

1065
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,320
definition of the word

1066
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,200
my patent is in drilling fluids

1067
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,560
drilling fluids are called mud

1068
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,040
if i wrote the patent and used the word

1069
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,880
mud and didn't define it as meaning

1070
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,560
drilling fluids the patent would have

1071
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,400
been interpreted as

1072
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,720
you know dirt and water mixed together

1073
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,520
that's through all law

1074
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,400
so

1075
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,800
a big thing that i try to do is like i

1076
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,400
said building the analysis

1077
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,320
to help students know what is legal or

1078
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,680
not legal

1079
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,440
so let me show you this

1080
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,640
first of all

1081
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,800
anytime you see this right here usc

1082
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,079
united states code that's federal law

1083
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:06,800
so

1084
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,119
here is the definition of computer under

1085
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,720
the cfaa

1086
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,359
this was written in the 1980s

1087
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,079
i don't think if i said at the beginning

1088
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,520
of this talk write your definition of

1089
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,800
computers

1090
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,960
that you would ever have come up with

1091
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,359
this definition it seems a little

1092
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,440
archaic especially when it says we're

1093
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,720
not talking about an automated

1094
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,040
typewriter typesetter portable handheld

1095
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,680
calculator i i i'm scared to ask who's

1096
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,280
never seen a typewriter or something

1097
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,240
right but this is our legal definition

1098
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,560
and this definition because it is in the

1099
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,359
cfaa computer front abuse act

1100
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,079
but it has been used in other cases to

1101
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,440
say is a cell phone a computer

1102
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
and the answer was well does it do this

1103
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,119
and this and this can i do this and this

1104
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,920
and this yeah yep so fun it's a computer

1105
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,520
it was used in a case where a man

1106
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,480
enticed a young girl over state lines

1107
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,800
uh by sending her a text before we had

1108
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,880
laws in place to prevent that

1109
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,400
and

1110
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,960
said yeah it's a computer so it comes

1111
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,839
under

1112
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,079
this law which it's not the intent of

1113
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,240
the law to catch like you know kind of

1114
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,599
either creepy people or almost

1115
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,680
pedophiles but it was interpreted as

1116
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,800
such it was used to determine that

1117
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,440
two gentlemen in uh new jersey i think

1118
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,000
who figured out uh a bug in poker

1119
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,119
machines

1120
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,560
that it wasn't a computer because it

1121
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,800
failed this test it wasn't as you know

1122
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
cfa they tried him under cfa they tried

1123
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,480
to get them on other things it was like

1124
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,079
dumb or dumber these guys figured out a

1125
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,520
bug in the purple machine if you didn't

1126
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,040
run into a certain sequence it paid out

1127
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,280
as if your last one last 10 you know

1128
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,640
most people would have taken it for

1129
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,960
millions they walked away with like 400

1130
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,720
000

1131
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
another big area especially to my

1132
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,400
international students is understanding

1133
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,520
that we have no unified body of law

1134
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,119
we are a confederation of states we are

1135
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,480
you know 50 states that got together

1136
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,160
most countries britain canada india

1137
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,200
whatever

1138
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,040
they also have states or provinces but

1139
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,240
they have unified federal law we don't

1140
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,680
we don't

1141
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,000
so i always kill my students that if

1142
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,440
you're going to do a crime stop and look

1143
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,839
up at the crime because it might be

1144
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,560
benefit you to cross the state line

1145
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,240
there's cases of

1146
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,640
sexting and cyber bullying we still have

1147
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,160
a couple of states that don't have laws

1148
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,839
against it in some states we have

1149
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,280
draconian laws

1150
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,200
uh washington state being one very

1151
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,240
strict

1152
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,119
law

1153
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,440
a felony in other states which requires

1154
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,000
a person uh to

1155
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,440
register as a sex offender for the rest

1156
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,400
of life and other states are

1157
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,160
misdemeanors it doesn't mean you know

1158
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,400
it's inconsistent right

1159
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,079
and then same time we look at these

1160
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,839
states such as texas and we have 14

1161
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,480
appellate districts so i live in houston

1162
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,320
which got split into two

1163
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,240
and they might interpret state law

1164
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,079
differently than the 10th district

1165
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,560
that's out of waco and unless it goes to

1166
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,640
the texas supreme court if it's civil or

1167
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,240
the texas court of criminal appeals if

1168
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,320
it's criminal

1169
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,839
it's the way it works

1170
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,040
right

1171
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,880
so i talked about standing and i just

1172
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,480
i've just put this in here i'm watching

1173
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,400
my time let's see

1174
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,560
sorry i had my little timer running and

1175
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,520
my

1176
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,280
phone security decided it didn't want to

1177
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,960
show me the clock anymore

1178
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,200
um

1179
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,640
but

1180
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,119
uh the standing and i always loved the

1181
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,119
part that

1182
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,720
this was a death penalty case i mean

1183
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,280
that's that's really interesting they

1184
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,800
i won't go into it unless we've got time

1185
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
with questions and answers but it's one

1186
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,280
of those

1187
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,720
weird things that only happens in the

1188
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,319
united states right

1189
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,880
this what i put in red is interpreted

1190
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,680
differently by the seventh just uh

1191
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,359
circuit court which is the appellate

1192
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,480
court for the federal courts in chicago

1193
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,359
then the accord in um

1194
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,839
the third court of appeals and that

1195
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,319
includes

1196
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,160
delaware

1197
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,640
so if you are in a data breach in a

1198
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,160
state with his seventh court of appeals

1199
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,319
they interpret the injury part the

1200
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,520
component in red as being just the risk

1201
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,119
of harm happening

1202
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,000
so my data is breached i can't prove

1203
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,720
anybody really stole money

1204
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,480
but they say the risk of that

1205
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,000
constitutes injury now listen to what

1206
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,680
i'm saying they have to have an injury

1207
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,480
in fact

1208
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,880
but they interpret that very liberally

1209
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,760
as opposed to the third circuit which

1210
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,359
includes delaware which many of our

1211
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,839
corporations are headquartered who say

1212
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,319
no unless you have real harm

1213
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,319
you fail standing

1214
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,400
and the biggest reason you don't have

1215
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
more success and data breaches and these

1216
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,960
kind of things is it fails the standing

1217
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,480
prong in that injury in fact

1218
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,760
so

1219
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,440
those are the legal things now we got to

1220
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,960
look at the technology things we're

1221
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,119
looking at hacking back is a big one and

1222
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,800
i know purdue's done a lot on this i

1223
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,880
quote staff from his talk here in

1224
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,839
december i think it was 2015 sometimes

1225
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,240
um

1226
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,319
you know hacking back uh president trump

1227
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:05,760
put through an executive order in

1228
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,480
september 2018 called we didn't call it

1229
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,160
hacking back

1230
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,599
uh we called it

1231
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,319
forward defense which was a euphemism

1232
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,079
because forward for defenseman let's not

1233
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,760
wait to get hacked

1234
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,319
we'll just attack you as a national

1235
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,000
strategy if you think we think you're

1236
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,880
going to attack us right

1237
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,240
we don't know where the status of that

1238
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,640
executive order is when i look for it

1239
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,400
it's taken off the white house website

1240
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,160
however i haven't found one that's been

1241
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,920
retracted which means it's still in

1242
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,160
effect so i don't know

1243
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,079
then we tell people to do privacy by

1244
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,480
design well you know when i look at

1245
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,960
privacy in that this nice framework that

1246
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,400
word shows up

1247
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,720
so many places so many times how do i

1248
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,960
know what that means or security by

1249
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,040
design you know these are like

1250
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,240
a tenant of gdprs you have privacy by

1251
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,599
design well what does that mean to me

1252
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,920
legally it's a technical term but how do

1253
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,720
i

1254
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,800
make sure i'm doing that legally

1255
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,760
another one is data ownership under gdpr

1256
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,839
you own the data the data subject in the

1257
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,040
us

1258
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,640
i think it's the corporations that own

1259
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,640
the data you know they've got data on me

1260
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,720
and i've got limited rights

1261
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,400
some of my other student concerns have

1262
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,800
been dangers of things like bug bounties

1263
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,640
or dangers of pen testing you know there

1264
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,560
was a case in kansas and missouri where

1265
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,160
the guys did pen testing and ended up

1266
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,680
spending a weekend in jail because

1267
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,599
somebody forgot to tell somebody and you

1268
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,480
know they hacked into the system

1269
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,560
and the biggest thing is in red is what

1270
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,280
my students say how do we know what is

1271
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,960
legal or not

1272
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,720
because all the concepts i've talked

1273
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,280
about jurisdictions standing you know

1274
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,040
where are you what state are you in or

1275
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,960
what part of the country are you in if

1276
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,400
it's federal law

1277
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,160
and then people who will say to me well

1278
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,920
that's not ethical well here's the

1279
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,160
problem with that

1280
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,079
law and ethics aren't really the same

1281
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:52,880
thing

1282
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,359
sadly the nazis wrote everything in law

1283
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,119
but no one could possibly argue that

1284
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,200
what they did was less than evil

1285
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,240
unethical immoral right

1286
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,359
uh some of the things that are in law we

1287
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,800
you know we have that gut reaction that

1288
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,680
as this doesn't pass my ethics test

1289
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,520
so we we talk about ethics in the law

1290
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,520
but they're not synonymous

1291
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,359
then we have the big one the difference

1292
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,359
between engineering and legal mindsets

1293
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,280
and that is this

1294
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,200
engineers computer scientists whatever

1295
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,920
we like to solve problems give me a

1296
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,240
problem and let me solve them

1297
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,400
and a lot of times like in algorithms or

1298
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,000
something there's only one solution is

1299
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,680
this a p you know is this uh

1300
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,920
non-polynomial time polynomial time did

1301
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,599
it and not the algorithm i'm sorry the

1302
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,280
problem that would be classified like

1303
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,480
that

1304
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,200
legal mindsets that well it depends oh

1305
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,960
you know this argument this week

1306
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,839
stronger for that argument for that

1307
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,599
uh problem being solved polynomial time

1308
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,200
but last week it was this you know and

1309
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,319
somebody would look at me and say your

1310
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,800
computer science professor you know what

1311
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,880
you know how'd you get through that

1312
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,040
our engineering mindsets are to solve a

1313
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,160
problem

1314
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,480
our legal mindsets it's difficult to

1315
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,119
solve the problem because we have so

1316
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,359
much unknown and because like i said

1317
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,000
technology moves like this and the law

1318
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,560
is always lagging behind and we are

1319
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,440
trying to interpret laws written for the

1320
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,040
physical world

1321
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,400
in the digital and virtual world and

1322
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,319
that's not going to change i'm working

1323
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,119
on a project now to look at the law and

1324
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,560
ethics of using tones and robots in

1325
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,400
response to coven

1326
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,160
with another professor here dr robin

1327
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,920
murphy and we have this concept

1328
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,359
sometimes she's looking at the ethical

1329
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,960
concerns and i'm like yeah but you know

1330
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,400
there's nothing against the law that

1331
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,319
they couldn't use that for surveillance

1332
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,160
right or there's well what if this and

1333
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,000
this yeah but the law doesn't have the

1334
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,680
law hasn't caught up to that yet

1335
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,319
so here's my classification i told you

1336
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:47,920
earlier if you're going to get in

1337
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,000
trouble and i hope you're not so i

1338
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,359
always tell my students i really don't

1339
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,520
want to see you in the news

1340
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,359
it's going to be under the laws in red

1341
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,280
the computer fraud and abuse act and the

1342
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,440
digital millennium copyright act and i

1343
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,920
spend a lot of time going through these

1344
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,280
laws

1345
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,880
the one in green is if you're going to

1346
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,960
be working for a company

1347
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,440
and something happens and the company is

1348
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,640
at risk

1349
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,400
such as and this isn't an exhaustive

1350
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,560
list gdpr in the california

1351
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,640
gdpr light of the consumer of the ccpa

1352
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,200
the ones in blue are laws that i talk

1353
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,720
about in class but they actually

1354
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,480
restrict the government

1355
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,800
they're not to be confused

1356
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,040
with our constitutional protections

1357
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,359
they're actually stronger in some sense

1358
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:32,319
than what we might have in

1359
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,160
constitutional protections but there's

1360
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,920
nothing preventing congress so this is

1361
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,160
where the government can or cannot get

1362
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,240
to your stored communications to your

1363
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,359
metadata about that to listening in you

1364
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,200
know they use the word wiretap and again

1365
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,040
people think wiretap is some physical

1366
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,200
thing and no that's not it in the legal

1367
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,040
sense wiretap is any interception of

1368
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,960
communication remember what i said legal

1369
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,880
terms trump

1370
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,720
by the way i

1371
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,880
like to do an exercise in beginning a

1372
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,280
class and i give them some typical cyber

1373
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,400
security terms since there's

1374
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,800
confidentiality integrity availability

1375
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,640
computer privacy

1376
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,880
and i asked the class what have legal

1377
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,640
definitions

1378
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,480
and they're always surprised when i show

1379
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,240
them that the terms confidentiality

1380
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,200
integrity and availability are defined

1381
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,800
in federal statute the u.s patriot act

1382
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,839
computer i've shown you from

1383
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,440
cfaa and then we always have this

1384
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,599
discussion that we have no general

1385
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,720
statutory definition for privacy

1386
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,720
we have laws to protect your student

1387
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,359
records ferpa medical records hipaa

1388
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,160
banking records uh gram leach bliley but

1389
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,559
no one can define for me what privacy is

1390
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,280
we have no general definition

1391
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,400
and uh

1392
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,079
you know engineers and computer

1393
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,599
scientists they like to see things in

1394
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,280
black and white and they don't like this

1395
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,800
well let me think about this um

1396
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,400
so let me close with kind of talking

1397
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,480
about how i teach i do standard lectures

1398
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,319
on old school kind of you know following

1399
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,920
my purdue model here

1400
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,319
we do do some discussions i it's not as

1401
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,880
easy to do because people

1402
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,720
either google the law you know i had

1403
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,240
somebody one time start arguing with me

1404
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,359
and i finally said where are you getting

1405
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,200
this and they said well right here and

1406
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,359
it was like that one that website's not

1407
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,520
valid that's somebody's opinion and

1408
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,760
other people say well in texas this and

1409
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,800
this and this and where you're getting

1410
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,400
that well i googled it well no in

1411
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,559
california non-competes are illegal in

1412
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,160
texas competes are illegal you know in

1413
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,480
california whatever you got to be

1414
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,640
careful so discussion sometimes you

1415
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,920
really have to watch or people get

1416
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,000
emotional in them um

1417
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,559
i've set myself up one time and

1418
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,160
asked about important supreme court

1419
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,680
decisions and the guy brought up the one

1420
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,520
about uh gay marriage and being in texas

1421
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,800
we have a very conservative thing and i

1422
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,640
thought oh no i've opened the door but

1423
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,040
uh but you know why he thought it

1424
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,280
shouldn't be constitutional of other

1425
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,880
people vote could be constitutional

1426
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,760
alike

1427
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,359
this semester i've added something where

1428
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,640
every week i do a short discussion on

1429
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,040
book recommendations uh tell this is how

1430
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,640
they tell me the world ends about cyber

1431
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,760
security

1432
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,160
the great dissenter is an awesome book

1433
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,319
everyone knows about brown v board of

1434
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,559
education in the early 50s that ended

1435
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,480
the separate but equal but what people

1436
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,640
don't know is a separate but equal was a

1437
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,640
supreme court doctrine in plessy v

1438
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,760
ferguson in 1898 i believe there was one

1439
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,160
long dissenter

1440
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,079
the majority of the court

1441
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,760
went for separate but equal and let's

1442
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,200
not fool ourselves we all knew it wasn't

1443
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,720
separate but equal

1444
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,119
the one to center was a former slave

1445
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,000
owner who had a half brother

1446
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,400
that not quite sure who the father was

1447
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,240
but the mother was undoubtedly a slave

1448
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,359
but

1449
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,319
john marshall harlan's father raised

1450
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,359
the bi-racial man as his son even though

1451
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,440
he couldn't have the son educated and

1452
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,960
the son actually became a millionaire

1453
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,960
and all this kind of stuff so you have

1454
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,520
this unique american perspective

1455
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,680
that the lone dissenter

1456
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,839
against separate but equal was a former

1457
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,839
slave owner who fought for the union he

1458
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,680
became an advocate for rights who came

1459
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,160
from this convoluted family background

1460
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,079
and the most important thing i tell my

1461
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,520
students is his dissent

1462
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,520
became the basis

1463
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,040
for

1464
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,040
thurgood marshall's

1465
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,040
argument before the supreme court

1466
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,800
and brown v board of education to me

1467
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,880
that's just fascinating and people i

1468
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,640
think we look at supreme court decisions

1469
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,079
at point a time and we don't realize the

1470
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,000
history the other if you ever just want

1471
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,680
to read one book

1472
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,920
on american law read gideon's trumpet

1473
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,319
and then you see we have a great system

1474
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,839
don't have time to talk about it but it

1475
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,720
was i teach from this textbook

1476
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,559
i teach a little bit of a talent manual

1477
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,880
the first three chapters due diligence

1478
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,319
jurisdiction uh i go through it but it's

1479
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,960
not international law most of it is not

1480
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,720
and it only applies it was a nato

1481
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,720
document so if you're not in nato you

1482
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,119
don't care about it anyway

1483
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,040
optional text i do a lecture on and

1484
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,559
cover you'll see this message when it's

1485
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,079
too late where she classifies a lot of

1486
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,160
these breaches goes through the policy

1487
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,160
jeff gossip's a favorite of mine 26

1488
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,000
words that created the internet

1489
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,760
um i mentioned this tell me the world

1490
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,440
ends i do this is a very writing

1491
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,000
intensive class no coding

1492
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,480
uh it's written assignments

1493
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,599
it's it's take home exams uh i have to

1494
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,760
be very crafty to create questions that

1495
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,880
you know so it eliminates uh or

1496
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,559
someone who works with other people are

1497
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:23,599
going to be

1498
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:24,640
you know

1499
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,319
show up i tell them they can use any

1500
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,000
source they can google they can use

1501
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,359
documents they can use class notes

1502
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,280
except a human being and then they do a

1503
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,800
semester paper and i have to tell you

1504
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,400
the semester papers i get are just

1505
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,200
really awesome so i'll close with this

1506
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,119
this was a comment that was passed back

1507
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,160
to me

1508
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,520
um

1509
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,440
uh from someone who took the class last

1510
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,160
spring and and would go home and tell

1511
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,000
everybody that lived with him what the

1512
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,839
class was like and i have like three

1513
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:52,319
students this semester that this student

1514
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:53,359
uh

1515
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,160
uh

1516
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,400
got to take the class so i think that's

1517
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,960
probably that 50 minutes i've probably

1518
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,359
left out something in my notes

1519
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:04,800
but uh let's look at the questions

1520
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,440
so is it hard to go from a phd to jd did

1521
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,040
you have to start over here's what you

1522
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,839
do i went to law school in my early 50s

1523
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,000
by that time i had raised kids as a

1524
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,880
single mom i had survived cancer

1525
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,800
i i'd been the up and downs

1526
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,319
i went in with a different attitude then

1527
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,839
you'd probably go in if you were you

1528
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,480
know 22 or 23. i went in with the

1529
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,559
attitude that if i don't like this i'm

1530
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,079
going to quit and do something else but

1531
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,680
i knew i was unhappy doing what i was

1532
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,599
doing in austin and i had hit age

1533
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,200
discrimination which i always say is not

1534
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,599
a glass ceiling it's solid titanium

1535
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,359
at that time me and michael dell seemed

1536
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,280
to be the only people in our age group

1537
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,520
still working and you know he was doing

1538
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,359
real well

1539
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,040
do you see a national standard for

1540
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,760
privacy and what is the alternative

1541
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,559
unfortunately i don't

1542
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,640
i don't and if we have more time to talk

1543
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,559
about this our notion of privacy if you

1544
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:55,680
think you're a graduate student you

1545
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,839
can't affect the world our notion of

1546
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,520
privacy started with a large journal

1547
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,599
article written by louis brandeis and

1548
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,599
samuel warren in the 1890s i always

1549
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:04,880
forget the exact year while they were in

1550
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,440
law school best definition of privacy i

1551
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,599
know

1552
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,880
to be let alone

1553
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,880
and as you all know louis brandeis later

1554
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,720
became a supreme court justice who

1555
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,400
authored and used this philosophy in

1556
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,640
many of our privacy

1557
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,720
what people miss is

1558
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,960
privacy supreme court decisions on

1559
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,520
privacy are roe v wade it's about

1560
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,160
privacy it's not about abortion

1561
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,400
lawrenceville taxes it's about who

1562
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,359
you're allowed to have sexual

1563
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:34,720
relationship with

1564
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,800
uh i always forget the name of the case

1565
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,680

1566
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,520

1569
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,839

1570
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,760
griswold thank you it's the griswolds i

1571

so our our whole notion of cyber

1575
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,520
security i'm sorry our notion of privacy

1576
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,280
from the supreme court are about

1577
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,680
personal behavior and this is something

1578
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,079
justice breyer wrote about recently

1579
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,160
and said does anybody realize it's all

1580

1582
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,760
notion of privacy you know hello

00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,440
um

1584
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,280
legal challenges with election and cyber

1585

you want to hang out after that yeah um

1587
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,920
so is this the one the scotus

1588
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,119
uh

1589
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,839
oh new jersey in 2021 scotus by the way

1590
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,640
just recently had a case against a

1591
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,400
georgia policeman who took who exceeded

1592
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,440
his authorization under cfaa was charged

1593
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,520
under cfaa and it's the first time i've

1594
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,960
seen a long time that the court said

1595
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,079
we're backing cfa a down we don't know

1596
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,440
and they let the guy know the guy was

1597
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,280
tried on other charges

1598
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,280
but they didn't take it as a cfa

1599
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,880
although i personally saw it as a clear

1600
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,079
cfa

1601
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,160
um

1602
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,400
you know violation so we're looking to

1603
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,480
the court now to say okay

1604
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,280
what's gonna happen

1605
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,400
uh you know there are so many

1606
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,480
so much stuff you can find good stuff on

1607
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,680
the internet

1608
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,480
i follow jeff kosif who's at the naval

1609
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,960
academy i follow scott shackleford who's

1610
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,799
at indiana university i can't remember

1611
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:18,319
the name of his institute but i've got

1612
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,559
one of his books right here probably two

1613
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:21,680
of his books

1614
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,799
um

1615
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,599
there's a lot that if you follow online

1616
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,920
that people who have computer science

1617
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,079
backgrounds and our lawyers and are

1618
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,760
working and teaching and researching

1619
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,440
this so that's two you can follow jeff

1620
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,160
costa and scott shackleford

1621
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,160
and let me look at the time

1622
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,960
we got about three minutes

1623
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,359
so to go back to mark fisher's question

1624
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,839
the supreme court

1625
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:48,319
there's no clear when they decline to

1626
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:50,400
hear a case remember the map i showed

1627
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,200
you

1628
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,680
of the different appellate districts

1629
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,720
here

1630
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,680
when they've declined your case we have

1631
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,000
a split in the surface

1632
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,240
because some of the some of the circuits

1633
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,160
will say you have to disclose your

1634
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,359
password and other circuits will say no

1635
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,119
and this is one of the things that

1636
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,040
confuses my students

1637
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,799
like how can you have federal law

1638
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,440
interpreted differently in different

1639
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,559
circuits

1640
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,640
different geographic locations well

1641
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,720
that's kind of the way it is i didn't

1642
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,440
make the system but we all live under it

1643
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,200
so when you comment on that through the

1644
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,119
supreme court they don't have to give us

1645
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,240
a reason

1646
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,720
you disclosed your iphone passwords then

1647
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,880
they let the lower courts really

1648
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,280
stand

1649
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:38,000
and uh new jersey i think that's in the

1650
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,599
third circuit you'll find that

1651
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,040
a whole different philosophy then let's

1652
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,200
say the ninth circuit

1653
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,440
courts try not to be political we know

1654
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,720
they are

1655
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,240
and if you look at some of the decisions

1656
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,680
come out of ninth circuit which is in

1657
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,359
san francisco

1658
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:56,880
they are very technology friendly

1659
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,559
because

1660
00:56:58,559 --> 00:56:59,760
where do they live

1661
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,359
where do you get those judges what is

1662
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,920
their experience right i don't think

1663
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,359
they wake up every morning and say i'm

1664
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:06,880
going to be political i think they're

1665
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,640
affected by the culture just like i live

1666
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,559
in texas and it's a very conservative

1667
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:11,760
state

1668
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,480
you know um

1669
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,960
it's a very conservative state

1670
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,319
so

1671
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:19,920
you can't help but

1672
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,119
you know if you don't like it you have

1673
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,559
to deal with it and if you like it you

1674
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,680
say yahoo you know this is great right

1675
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,280
but we're affected by where we are

1676
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,440
and our history

1677
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,480
other questions

1678
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,559
a bunch of the chat i'm missing

1679
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,440
i think i asked people to move their

1680
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,599
conversations over to uh

1681
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:48,880
the chat

1682
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,359
to the q a yes oh okay i think i've got

1683
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,839
all the q a so scott talked i've never

1684
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:56,079
met scott shackleford but i really like

1685
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,040
him

1686
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,640
if anybody knows somebody different than

1687
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,200
jeff kosif and scott chackleberg i'm

1688
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,040
trying to write a book on cyber security

1689
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,400
risk because i can't find a good one

1690
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,839
i would never try to write a book on

1691
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:10,079
cyber security law because those two

1692
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,599
guys

1693
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,359
they got it down you know i would never

1694
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:14,960
be able to compete

1695
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,400
there there is a an acm group on cyber

1696
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,240
and and the law

1697
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,680
oh yeah

1698
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,319
but um

1699
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,240
there's not a lot public but they do

1700
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,200
issue

1701
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,119
um

1702
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,119
opinions and statements on occasion and

1703
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:32,160
weigh in on

1704
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,520
um through them i've actually filed

1705
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,720
several amica briefs with

1706
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,640
actually with the supreme court

1707
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,760
so um

1708
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,040
oh cool there is some action there

1709
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,640
there is that and there's the electronic

1710
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,640
freedom foundation which i also follow

1711
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,480
but i have to tell my students remember

1712
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,720
these are non-binding these are

1713
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,400
you know you can follow the amicus

1714
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,280
briefs and everything and you know eff

1715
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,880
might have some great ideas but they

1716
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,680
have no legal authority they try to

1717
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,760
uh be persuasive

1718
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,559
yeah

1719
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:05,839
um

1720
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,799
several several groups like that um

1721
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,720
and and i also mentioned there for

1722
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,480
anybody as a purdue student

1723
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,720

1724

1725
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,079

1726
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:25,839

1727
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,079
